p306/p306_269|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p306/p306_168|Four policemen were wounded.
p306/p306_040|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p306/p306_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p306/p306_051|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p306/p306_109|There are some new buildings in there.
p306/p306_026|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p306/p306_134|There is still much work to be done.
p306/p306_211|He ended up a headmaster.
p306/p306_108|You either have him or you don't.
p306/p306_146|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p306/p306_185|I am writing a novel.
p306/p306_290|This is a young team, you know.
p306/p306_178|It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
p306/p306_161|You should be there with six different characters.
p306/p306_123|This is not understood by people outside.
p306/p306_126|There is a lack of chemistry.
p306/p306_328|Maybe it helps us.
p306/p306_346|English is the language of pop music.
p306/p306_220|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p306/p306_236|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p306/p306_284|We said, What do you mean?
p306/p306_162|Laura is an investment banker.
p306/p306_265|Holland won by five wickets.
p306/p306_223|She didn't tell us anything new.
p306/p306_086|I have made good progress.
p306/p306_315|A great deal has been achieved.
p306/p306_225|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p306/p306_127|I went straight to the toilet.
p306/p306_340|Well, was it?
p306/p306_106|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p306/p306_259|It's the stop-gap before extinction.
p306/p306_080|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p306/p306_019|Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p306/p306_192|These elements are in the book.
p306/p306_033|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p306/p306_060|We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
p306/p306_129|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p306/p306_279|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p306/p306_300|We agreed to disagree.
p306/p306_322|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p306/p306_229|You can feel at home in China.
p306/p306_099|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p306/p306_239|It's just gotten too big.
p306/p306_222|It was a stunning drive from Jon.
p306/p306_084|Why did they let him go?
p306/p306_221|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p306/p306_197|We have only nine months to go.
p306/p306_184|We believe a third party was involved.
p306/p306_117|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p306/p306_181|It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p306/p306_074|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p306/p306_036|He said he now intends to fly today.
p306/p306_035|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p306/p306_133|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p306/p306_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p306/p306_172|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p306/p306_286|The law will take its course.
p306/p306_248|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p306/p306_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p306/p306_316|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p306/p306_214|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p306/p306_085|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p306/p306_118|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p306/p306_319|I tend to not look back.
p306/p306_305|People can get them if they want.
p306/p306_122|I will speak to Michael about this.
p306/p306_159|They thought they had found a home.
p306/p306_095|The mood is upbeat.
p306/p306_302|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p306/p306_125|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p306/p306_182|She is living proof of their expertise.
p306/p306_254|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p306/p306_258|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p306/p306_274|It does not move, which is amazing.
p306/p306_285|I need them to set my career.
p306/p306_055|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p306/p306_261|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p306/p306_042|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p306/p306_245|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p306/p306_246|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p306/p306_079|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p306/p306_264|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p306/p306_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p306/p306_177|It shows that we are a civilised society.
p306/p306_053|Retirement, who knows?
p306/p306_082|It is truly fields of miracles.
p306/p306_187|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p306/p306_341|We won't let you down.
p306/p306_073|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p306/p306_268|Once they go away they won't come back.
p306/p306_356|No person was charged.
p306/p306_202|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p306/p306_242|They were two different types.
p306/p306_063|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p306/p306_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p306/p306_092|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p306/p306_348|It is a simple equation.
p306/p306_230|This is all part of being opening the door.
p306/p306_100|My office is bare.
p306/p306_142|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p306/p306_096|They told us about it the next day.
p306/p306_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p306/p306_186|A bit of match fitness is required.
p306/p306_317|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p306/p306_351|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p306/p306_061|It's all too short term.
p306/p306_233|He will become the sovereign.
p306/p306_139|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p306/p306_323|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p306/p306_078|We must move on.
p306/p306_334|We will be homeless.
p306/p306_183|This one was my best chance.
p306/p306_308|He is a law unto himself.
p306/p306_128|She says the royal family get on well.
p306/p306_276|The threat to rural areas is real.
p306/p306_253|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p306/p306_173|It has been recorded twice.
p306/p306_144|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p306/p306_310|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p306/p306_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p306/p306_068|How things have changed since then.
p306/p306_295|People will make up their own minds.
p306/p306_041|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p306/p306_249|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p306/p306_281|This is a great shame.
p306/p306_196|The FBI could become involved.
p306/p306_138|We were with him the whole time.
p306/p306_070|This is the way things should be handled.
p306/p306_252|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p306/p306_160|She collapsed and died a day later.
p306/p306_327|It may also be her last.
p306/p306_357|I've only met him three times.
p306/p306_072|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p306/p306_360|She looked very, very poor.
p306/p306_058|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
p306/p306_215|If we live forever, can we be said to live?
p306/p306_153|We need some confidence to get a win.
p306/p306_121|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p306/p306_098|There are a huge number of arts.
p306/p306_050|Except for this, it was offside.
p306/p306_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p306/p306_294|In the old days, it was easy.
p306/p306_176|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p306/p306_293|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
p306/p306_029|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p306/p306_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p306/p306_135|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p306/p306_057|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p306/p306_091|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p306/p306_204|Donald was a man with many friends.
p306/p306_227|It was a poor performance.
p306/p306_028|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p306/p306_321|I got a yellow card.
p306/p306_291|It's not even finished.
p306/p306_097|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p306/p306_247|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p306/p306_102|Where is the anthrax?
p306/p306_090|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p306/p306_256|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p306/p306_195|I would like Glasgow.
p306/p306_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p306/p306_358|You see, my back has gone.
p306/p306_171|We want to help them through it.
p306/p306_207|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p306/p306_131|That group reported just before Christmas.
p306/p306_081|His options are severely limited.
p306/p306_299|They finished second and third.
p306/p306_071|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p306/p306_064|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p306/p306_262|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p306/p306_232|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p306/p306_307|They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p306/p306_191|Twaddle is a case in point.
p306/p306_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p306/p306_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p306/p306_311|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p306/p306_156|This is a foolish idea.
p306/p306_203|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p306/p306_077|You'd think there was a match on today.
p306/p306_270|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p306/p306_329|Three bystanders were killed.
p306/p306_043|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p306/p306_287|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p306/p306_324|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p306/p306_205|We played them off the pitch.
p306/p306_273|The board has rejected her proposals.
p306/p306_278|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p306/p306_298|My view has now completely changed.
p306/p306_089|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p306/p306_083|They are not an item.
p306/p306_301|He was then replaced by Ross.
p306/p306_297|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p306/p306_049|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p306/p306_104|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p306/p306_347|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p306/p306_320|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p306/p306_034|Blood samples have been taken.
p306/p306_094|You had better believe it.
p306/p306_337|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p306/p306_166|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p306/p306_243|It need not be like that.
p306/p306_030|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p306/p306_048|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p306/p306_331|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p306/p306_163|I took a minibus into town.
p306/p306_158|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p306/p306_154|Does that put pressure on us?
p306/p306_044|We like being the underdogs.
p306/p306_309|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p306/p306_037|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p306/p306_093|But the relief was short-lived.
p306/p306_076|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p306/p306_174|It was a bit like having children.
p306/p306_257|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p306/p306_277|Tourism continues to struggle.
p306/p306_103|Housing is in very short supply.
p306/p306_120|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p306/p306_210|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p306/p306_333|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p306/p306_039|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p306/p306_237|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p306/p306_326|She is now on the back benches.
p306/p306_335|I believe he can do a better job.
p306/p306_338|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p306/p306_111|I'm not a diva.
p306/p306_354|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p306/p306_075|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p306/p306_240|Was all this really just five months ago?
p306/p306_250|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p306/p306_136|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p306/p306_113|Look at them after three days of rain.
p306/p306_283|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p306/p306_179|I came home by ambulance.
p306/p306_343|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p306/p306_238|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p306/p306_231|We have tried to keep his head up.
p306/p306_180|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p306/p306_167|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p306/p306_031|I don't believe you own anything.
p306/p306_330|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p306/p306_147|We need a new kind of theatre.
p306/p306_355|I didn't even have the first idea.
p306/p306_119|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p306/p306_234|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p306/p306_208|We were on top and could have won.
p306/p306_226|I found a fault and worked at it.
p306/p306_130|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p306/p306_218|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p306/p306_345|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p306/p306_206|It was turning that way all across Europe.
p306/p306_349|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p306/p306_101|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p306/p306_224|There is nothing like this back home.
p306/p306_054|He was shocked by what he saw.
p306/p306_194|I am considered a teenager.
p306/p306_241|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p306/p306_069|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p306/p306_263|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p306/p306_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p306/p306_027|This is not an amnesty.
p306/p306_306|Their message was simple.
p306/p306_219|I might get an injury very easily.
p306/p306_296|After that he became more romantic.
p306/p306_143|He's been the key to everything.
p306/p306_251|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p306/p306_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p306/p306_132|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p306/p306_116|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p306/p306_244|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p306/p306_304|We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
p306/p306_201|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p306/p306_052|It's a grey area.
p306/p306_025|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p306/p306_065|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p306/p306_292|Everyone knew where they were.
p306/p306_124|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p306/p306_267|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p306/p306_289|The fund has three elements.
p306/p306_067|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p306/p306_288|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p306/p306_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p306/p306_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p306/p306_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p306/p306_155|You've seen the polls then, Sean.
p306/p306_213|It is like being a qualifier again.
p306/p306_282|That was merely their initial problem.
p306/p306_046|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p306/p306_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p306/p306_318|Too often it is not.
p306/p306_001|Please call Stella.
p306/p306_145|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p306/p306_189|It was located on the remote control.
p306/p306_325|It's good to start with Judith.
p306/p306_216|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p306/p306_112|There is great relief at this point.
p306/p306_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p306/p306_339|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p306/p306_157|You might even have seen him.
p306/p306_199|I like footballers who play well.
p306/p306_062|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p306/p306_255|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p306/p306_107|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p306/p306_303|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p306/p306_066|He also does not get on with Christina.
p306/p306_342|What kind of person is he?
p306/p306_115|There is no point in pushing it.
p306/p306_169|Who do these people think they are?
p306/p306_312|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p306/p306_336|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p306/p306_105|People just came on their own.
p306/p306_059|He was taken ill in December last year.
p306/p306_314|It was just completely erased.
p306/p306_212|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p306/p306_313|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p306/p306_217|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p306/p306_332|He made no big mistakes.
p306/p306_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p306/p306_175|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p306/p306_088|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p306/p306_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p306/p306_137|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p306/p306_275|She is a very lucky young lady.
p306/p306_038|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p306/p306_272|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p306/p306_359|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p306/p306_165|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p306/p306_141|That's because we work hard at it.
p306/p306_266|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p306/p306_056|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p306/p306_087|We do need a new one.
p306/p306_110|I am prepared to step down.
p306/p306_164|I do my job.
p306/p306_198|Both of them have looked good.
p306/p306_193|You look at them and you understand.
p306/p306_344|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p306/p306_045|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p306/p306_209|That night was a terrible muddle.
p306/p306_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p306/p306_188|The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
p306/p306_047|But the law is very clear on this.
p306/p306_032|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p306/p306_190|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p306/p306_260|He must have something up his sleeve.
p306/p306_228|They may yet have the last laugh.
p246/p246_262|Blood samples were taken.
p246/p246_304|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p246/p246_244|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p246/p246_238|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p246/p246_207|My neighbours are horrified.
p246/p246_064|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p246/p246_347|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p246/p246_046|They said she was stable.
p246/p246_271|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p246/p246_079|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p246/p246_321|It's too horrible to think.
p246/p246_300|He was at home with his pals.
p246/p246_042|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p246/p246_293|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p246/p246_082|It is a blow.
p246/p246_279|It is so very obvious.
p246/p246_198|It's all about money, money, money.
p246/p246_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p246/p246_345|He had taken everything from me.
p246/p246_333|Two people were interviewed.
p246/p246_038|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p246/p246_215|The report is due out next month.
p246/p246_239|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p246/p246_225|But she was.
p246/p246_301|What has altered?
p246/p246_349|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p246/p246_268|We are happy.
p246/p246_307|The plot is minimal.
p246/p246_066|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p246/p246_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p246/p246_146|It is not just about pay.
p246/p246_350|The pair are very much in love.
p246/p246_270|We're in shock.
p246/p246_137|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p246/p246_083|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p246/p246_039|Indeed, he does.
p246/p246_043|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p246/p246_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p246/p246_257|I could have got out a long time ago.
p246/p246_305|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p246/p246_139|She died at her home.
p246/p246_286|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p246/p246_220|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p246/p246_359|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p246/p246_141|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p246/p246_180|They need to look after themselves.
p246/p246_306|We could easily be cut again.
p246/p246_169|As we worked.
p246/p246_044|We will push.
p246/p246_233|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p246/p246_205|It had all been arranged.
p246/p246_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p246/p246_295|Bombing slaughter rejected
p246/p246_285|But I've won both ways.
p246/p246_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p246/p246_105|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p246/p246_103|Before the game we went for a pint.
p246/p246_048|There is no reason at all.
p246/p246_226|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p246/p246_001|Please call Stella.
p246/p246_060|Scotland had great assets.
p246/p246_297|No Briton has ever won.
p246/p246_176|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p246/p246_059|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p246/p246_242|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p246/p246_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p246/p246_341|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p246/p246_263|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p246/p246_119|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p246/p246_113|Who would be a referee?
p246/p246_065|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p246/p246_078|I first met him last summer.
p246/p246_266|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p246/p246_325|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p246/p246_136|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p246/p246_329|Who will do it?
p246/p246_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p246/p246_099|No, the equipment is extra.
p246/p246_249|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p246/p246_210|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p246/p246_326|He scored a touchdown.
p246/p246_193|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p246/p246_355|It is a memorial.
p246/p246_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p246/p246_324|Either team will be hard.
p246/p246_131|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p246/p246_171|It is not either national standards or local control.
p246/p246_081|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p246/p246_123|I just wanted a break.
p246/p246_191|Is that success?
p246/p246_352|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p246/p246_330|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p246/p246_212|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p246/p246_312|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p246/p246_027|Is this accurate?
p246/p246_332|This is the last straw.
p246/p246_101|Oil embargo endorsed.
p246/p246_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p246/p246_067|There could be a way back.
p246/p246_235|It's quite nice.
p246/p246_041|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p246/p246_343|I got a yellow card.
p246/p246_299|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p246/p246_314|She is on a life support machine.
p246/p246_140|He realises his mistake.
p246/p246_218|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p246/p246_250|Is there on his hands?
p246/p246_076|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p246/p246_134|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p246/p246_230|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p246/p246_061|It's that kind of place.
p246/p246_280|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p246/p246_248|There's the mix.
p246/p246_243|The scene is about this?
p246/p246_338|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p246/p246_063|He could make it.
p246/p246_168|He was a crazy man.
p246/p246_331|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p246/p246_162|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p246/p246_085|It will be tight.
p246/p246_194|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p246/p246_050|She looked so young.
p246/p246_111|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p246/p246_246|I should think so, too.
p246/p246_253|they fail to engage.
p246/p246_258|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p246/p246_117|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p246/p246_053|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p246/p246_129|We work well together.
p246/p246_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p246/p246_092|But I was wrong.
p246/p246_339|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p246/p246_071|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p246/p246_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p246/p246_100|That would be unlawful.
p246/p246_149|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p246/p246_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p246/p246_159|I will tell you.
p246/p246_260|There's not much money in cycling.
p246/p246_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p246/p246_150|I was stunned.
p246/p246_276|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p246/p246_288|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p246/p246_322|Off with their heads.
p246/p246_227|At the time, he was a living legend.
p246/p246_166|You had to go and see him.
p246/p246_069|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p246/p246_163|We have a budget in March.
p246/p246_346|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p246/p246_174|Tony had arrived.
p246/p246_353|Hartley should know.
p246/p246_354|That would help.
p246/p246_275|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p246/p246_029|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p246/p246_177|The goals were good.
p246/p246_160|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p246/p246_164|Again, we were lucky.
p246/p246_237|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p246/p246_234|You should be.
p246/p246_334|I've got no secret.
p246/p246_241|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p246/p246_097|They make a selective perception process.
p246/p246_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p246/p246_267|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p246/p246_040|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p246/p246_222|It's not before time.
p246/p246_156|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p246/p246_115|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p246/p246_147|I am just trying to do my job.
p246/p246_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p246/p246_261|Souter will be back.
p246/p246_197|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p246/p246_157|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p246/p246_128|It's perfectly feasible.
p246/p246_313|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p246/p246_122|It is not a U-turn.
p246/p246_148|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p246/p246_303|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p246/p246_327|Is that an issue?
p246/p246_336|I'm very lucky.
p246/p246_135|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p246/p246_206|I have decided to quit the show.
p246/p246_186|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p246/p246_030|There's a story, too.
p246/p246_232|Of course I was tempted.
p246/p246_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p246/p246_133|My daughter is an adult.
p246/p246_318|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p246/p246_251|I can't get a job.
p246/p246_125|I am now unemployed.
p246/p246_247|It was a hit.
p246/p246_284|We are a grandmother.
p246/p246_080|A play is a set of actions.
p246/p246_182|Does this matter?
p246/p246_077|He is in the queue.
p246/p246_088|Tony Blair said as little.
p246/p246_047|Is a drug dealer?
p246/p246_109|It was the eighties.
p246/p246_173|I drove the ball well.
p246/p246_278|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p246/p246_201|I will win.
p246/p246_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p246/p246_090|This one did.
p246/p246_290|He will address the nation this evening.
p246/p246_187|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p246/p246_302|She is really magic.
p246/p246_070|It is a job creation scheme.
p246/p246_228|My wife and family are the support system.
p246/p246_127|It plans to return to this field.
p246/p246_189|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p246/p246_102|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p246/p246_116|Who would have?
p246/p246_190|The concerns are the same.
p246/p246_361|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p246/p246_075|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p246/p246_224|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p246/p246_057|That's the truth.
p246/p246_255|Is that a serious question?
p246/p246_209|In each case they were a goal down.
p246/p246_054|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p246/p246_049|The State would provide.
p246/p246_037|They're just different.
p246/p246_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p246/p246_152|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p246/p246_095|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p246/p246_272|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p246/p246_114|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p246/p246_052|Here's a clue.
p246/p246_093|It is home-grown.
p246/p246_143|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p246/p246_031|This is the window.
p246/p246_308|You are the glory.
p246/p246_056|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p246/p246_121|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p246/p246_265|There is no link.
p246/p246_245|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p246/p246_240|It is hard won.
p246/p246_142|I was awful.
p246/p246_172|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p246/p246_184|There is no openness.
p246/p246_348|Until they came to do it.
p246/p246_202|Feel the heat?
p246/p246_236|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p246/p246_296|We are not going to forget.
p246/p246_358|Their time has gone.
p246/p246_274|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p246/p246_216|Because they didn't want to know.
p246/p246_051|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p246/p246_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p246/p246_328|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p246/p246_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p246/p246_219|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p246/p246_256|They must play for each other.
p246/p246_319|They had a confession.
p246/p246_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p246/p246_033|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p246/p246_231|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p246/p246_091|It was clear.
p246/p246_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p246/p246_084|They lived for their children.
p246/p246_036|It has failed.
p246/p246_118|There were no grounds for his action.
p246/p246_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p246/p246_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p246/p246_138|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p246/p246_221|I'd never seen a play about me.
p246/p246_183|One was a lawyer.
p246/p246_291|It was a virus.
p246/p246_034|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p246/p246_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p246/p246_287|You feel very helpless.
p246/p246_106|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p246/p246_281|It's so awful.
p246/p246_155|We are on a four-year mission.
p246/p246_126|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p246/p246_351|I was in the train station overnight.
p246/p246_165|We should do everything at a stroke.
p246/p246_055|It is unique.
p246/p246_204|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p246/p246_211|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p246/p246_335|He loved the moment.
p246/p246_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p246/p246_124|Twaddle is a case in point.
p246/p246_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p246/p246_074|Today she has been released.
p246/p246_316|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p246/p246_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p246/p246_087|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p246/p246_086|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p246/p246_153|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p246/p246_112|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p246/p246_068|Then followed a bout of flu.
p246/p246_320|I came into this world with nothing.
p246/p246_167|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p246/p246_282|If not, he should go home.
p246/p246_200|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p246/p246_311|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p246/p246_130|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p246/p246_199|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p246/p246_104|It was an adventure.
p246/p246_178|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p246/p246_025|He has not been named.
p246/p246_144|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p246/p246_337|Our policy is clear.
p246/p246_062|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p246/p246_161|It is not like us.
p246/p246_315|We are a peaceful people.
p246/p246_289|Dialogue is the key.
p246/p246_203|He knows a lot.
p246/p246_032|He was jailed for five years.
p246/p246_098|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p246/p246_294|It was good.
p246/p246_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p246/p246_192|I do not own the vessel in question.
p246/p246_223|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p246/p246_188|It was very frightened and dirty.
p246/p246_045|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p246/p246_323|There was no time scale.
p246/p246_170|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p246/p246_175|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p246/p246_179|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p246/p246_264|It will be done in stages.
p246/p246_340|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p246/p246_181|It's to do with context.
p246/p246_298|And huge, indeed, it is.
p246/p246_158|I'd love to be like Peter.
p246/p246_196|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p246/p246_058|I feel I did not have enough time.
p246/p246_360|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p246/p246_107|Is that right?
p246/p246_292|Yet, it worked.
p246/p246_283|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p246/p246_277|They seem to get away with it.
p246/p246_151|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p246/p246_195|Who will pay for this?
p246/p246_208|It's not ideal.
p246/p246_229|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p246/p246_089|As, indeed, they would be.
p246/p246_342|They should take their mobile phones.
p246/p246_108|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p246/p246_120|She really suffered for her art.
p246/p246_110|It is so sad.
p246/p246_252|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p246/p246_094|I saw the whole thing.
p246/p246_309|The minister is the engineer.
p246/p246_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p246/p246_310|The letters are going out today.
p246/p246_073|People must remain vigilant.
p246/p246_217|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p246/p246_273|It's a way of life.
p246/p246_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p246/p246_145|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p246/p246_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p246/p246_357|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p246/p246_072|Even the one she loved.
p246/p246_096|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p246/p246_154|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p246/p246_132|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p303/p303_054|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p303/p303_335|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p303/p303_058|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p303/p303_015|The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p303/p303_164|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p303/p303_346|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p303/p303_229|But there has never been the time, she said.
p303/p303_055|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p303/p303_165|It is quite an eye opener.
p303/p303_026|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p303/p303_042|His charisma is all on the course.
p303/p303_158|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p303/p303_085|We really need research to help with that.
p303/p303_273|It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
p303/p303_082|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p303/p303_239|I think in three dimensions.
p303/p303_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p303/p303_256|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p303/p303_056|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p303/p303_184|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p303/p303_294|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p303/p303_196|I don't know exactly what happened.
p303/p303_215|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p303/p303_038|It was a crucial moment.
p303/p303_310|The crowd was awesome.
p303/p303_247|We're into that build-up now.
p303/p303_300|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p303/p303_328|Who is going to be penalised?
p303/p303_249|We can just get on with our game.
p303/p303_137|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p303/p303_066|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p303/p303_225|It did my image a lot of good!
p303/p303_297|That is a job for the Government.
p303/p303_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p303/p303_327|They will want to watch a winning team.
p303/p303_148|All kinds of things occur.
p303/p303_104|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p303/p303_175|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p303/p303_046|I did not want any damage to us.
p303/p303_302|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p303/p303_189|It is simple and easy to use.
p303/p303_131|He loves the big occasions.
p303/p303_103|He went to see what he could learn.
p303/p303_223|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p303/p303_067|Most people know that.
p303/p303_041|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p303/p303_133|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p303/p303_321|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p303/p303_068|Some people still think she should be English.
p303/p303_078|We just try to make great records.
p303/p303_150|It was fit for royalty.
p303/p303_145|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p303/p303_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p303/p303_135|I first met him last summer.
p303/p303_237|But one shouldn't go by that.
p303/p303_353|This represents a tough game for us.
p303/p303_266|There is no such thing.
p303/p303_166|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p303/p303_281|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p303/p303_052|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p303/p303_209|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p303/p303_291|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p303/p303_264|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p303/p303_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p303/p303_299|And he had much need.
p303/p303_290|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p303/p303_305|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p303/p303_342|I get to work with very good people.
p303/p303_100|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p303/p303_116|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p303/p303_329|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p303/p303_336|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p303/p303_113|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p303/p303_125|I asked why he had come.
p303/p303_278|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p303/p303_275|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p303/p303_043|This is purely financial.
p303/p303_001|Please call Stella.
p303/p303_236|We're still talking with a few people.
p303/p303_340|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p303/p303_272|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p303/p303_309|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p303/p303_230|This could be one such case, he declared.
p303/p303_298|I felt the head was very like me.
p303/p303_253|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p303/p303_093|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p303/p303_325|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p303/p303_048|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p303/p303_218|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p303/p303_122|I've got no secret.
p303/p303_032|The feeling is marvellous.
p303/p303_296|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p303/p303_163|It's now down in black and white.
p303/p303_288|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p303/p303_221|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p303/p303_206|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p303/p303_124|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p303/p303_173|We're all family men with children.
p303/p303_178|You let a lot of people down.
p303/p303_283|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p303/p303_057|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p303/p303_311|That was moving the goalposts.
p303/p303_320|I am proud of those guys.
p303/p303_059|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p303/p303_099|Their vision was not impeded.
p303/p303_322|It is too early to speculate.
p303/p303_040|I let go the telephone and ran.
p303/p303_204|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p303/p303_081|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p303/p303_240|They had four children together.
p303/p303_110|There was no time scale.
p303/p303_098|She is on a life support machine.
p303/p303_207|The line-up is a tasty one.
p303/p303_151|It is always the same, isn't it?
p303/p303_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p303/p303_259|Do you think you have a shot?
p303/p303_217|They had given up on him.
p303/p303_286|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p303/p303_280|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p303/p303_250|But first it goes out on TV.
p303/p303_037|Others may be trying to catch up.
p303/p303_136|It was to be published next month.
p303/p303_072|What do they pay to join the club?
p303/p303_144|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p303/p303_077|He was obviously very genuine.
p303/p303_301|This can only help us go forward.
p303/p303_161|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p303/p303_028|That is just a load of baloney.
p303/p303_313|Rapid revision was required.
p303/p303_155|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p303/p303_128|A lot of people were in tears.
p303/p303_168|Can they be serious?
p303/p303_347|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p303/p303_027|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p303/p303_179|One person was believed to have been hit.
p303/p303_111|Only the scale of change differed.
p303/p303_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p303/p303_130|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p303/p303_323|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p303/p303_156|Equity declined to comment.
p303/p303_132|They should take their mobile phones.
p303/p303_105|Referees are easy targets.
p303/p303_213|They should also have the right to vote.
p303/p303_318|We have grown up in Britain.
p303/p303_119|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p303/p303_248|It is the end of an era.
p303/p303_063|That is a mark of what you are.
p303/p303_244|All were later allowed home.
p303/p303_117|And it's more subversive.
p303/p303_171|It's just that we see different things.
p303/p303_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p303/p303_182|They just would not have run away.
p303/p303_263|We've had great things in the past.
p303/p303_292|I have been coming here for nine years.
p303/p303_287|There is no smoking gun.
p303/p303_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p303/p303_337|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p303/p303_029|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p303/p303_306|Some have other commitments.
p303/p303_315|We couldn't go very fast.
p303/p303_076|It will be very useful for us.
p303/p303_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p303/p303_317|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p303/p303_045|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p303/p303_231|I fell in love with ballet.
p303/p303_088|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p303/p303_138|It could have been a hammering by now.
p303/p303_282|She had been sexually assaulted.
p303/p303_033|I think they should have more respect.
p303/p303_139|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p303/p303_289|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p303/p303_044|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p303/p303_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p303/p303_308|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p303/p303_095|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p303/p303_181|We aren't going to play better.
p303/p303_293|I felt under no pressure today.
p303/p303_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p303/p303_349|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p303/p303_319|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p303/p303_075|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p303/p303_174|I think we showed that after half time.
p303/p303_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p303/p303_051|This guy is never going to give up.
p303/p303_257|They seem to be backing off from that.
p303/p303_202|I am not a happy man.
p303/p303_112|Tell you the team he picked?
p303/p303_222|She has now been registered as disabled.
p303/p303_205|I'm going with all three.
p303/p303_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p303/p303_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p303/p303_167|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p303/p303_270|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p303/p303_194|We know them as mobile telephones.
p303/p303_274|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p303/p303_219|It has made me feel good.
p303/p303_276|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p303/p303_049|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p303/p303_176|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p303/p303_126|Will they ever reopen?
p303/p303_344|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p303/p303_090|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p303/p303_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p303/p303_149|I expected these kind of questions.
p303/p303_246|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p303/p303_192|I think we finished fifth.
p303/p303_333|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p303/p303_348|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p303/p303_350|People tended to stay there for some time.
p303/p303_220|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p303/p303_200|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p303/p303_343|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p303/p303_031|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p303/p303_186|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p303/p303_195|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p303/p303_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p303/p303_034|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p303/p303_268|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p303/p303_267|I feel very strongly about that.
p303/p303_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p303/p303_304|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p303/p303_079|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p303/p303_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p303/p303_326|What is the truth about the cow?
p303/p303_198|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p303/p303_251|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p303/p303_064|Seven children had lost both parents.
p303/p303_214|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p303/p303_086|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p303/p303_233|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p303/p303_241|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p303/p303_062|Don't say you have not been warned.
p303/p303_269|After that nothing could save him.
p303/p303_279|I bought a car at auction.
p303/p303_070|Repayment is not part of the game.
p303/p303_324|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p303/p303_332|I have a theory.
p303/p303_190|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p303/p303_331|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p303/p303_177|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p303/p303_141|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p303/p303_252|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p303/p303_080|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p303/p303_254|I learned a lot from her.
p303/p303_025|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p303/p303_047|It was an easy decision to come here.
p303/p303_345|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p303/p303_065|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p303/p303_140|I played really well on the back nine.
p303/p303_143|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p303/p303_123|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p303/p303_238|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p303/p303_096|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p303/p303_121|They will know they deserve to be there.
p303/p303_351|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p303/p303_129|We have great team spirit.
p303/p303_212|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p303/p303_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p303/p303_224|I was living with my mum.
p303/p303_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p303/p303_191|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p303/p303_228|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p303/p303_097|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p303/p303_074|We are now in a safe place.
p303/p303_101|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p303/p303_030|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p303/p303_154|That gives us something to kick against.
p303/p303_050|I saw them not long after it happened.
p303/p303_258|They have a very good method of working.
p303/p303_108|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p303/p303_134|We have big ideas.
p303/p303_203|You can be sure we will have problems.
p303/p303_208|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p303/p303_109|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p303/p303_159|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p303/p303_162|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p303/p303_245|She has a wonderful mind.
p303/p303_188|Glasgow then took control.
p303/p303_153|I felt really good until Friday.
p303/p303_087|There were no passengers on board.
p303/p303_169|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p303/p303_307|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p303/p303_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p303/p303_183|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p303/p303_146|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p303/p303_193|It was not a foul.
p303/p303_118|We are losing this war.
p303/p303_295|And that was the adults.
p303/p303_187|Our people should be immune.
p303/p303_115|I'd like to take the plunge.
p303/p303_312|We have the location, which is assured.
p303/p303_147|I always knew she was funny.
p303/p303_232|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p303/p303_073|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p303/p303_255|We have reacted well to each other.
p303/p303_271|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p303/p303_262|She may even appear in some more films.
p303/p303_226|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p303/p303_341|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p303/p303_330|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p303/p303_242|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p303/p303_235|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p303/p303_071|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p303/p303_352|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p303/p303_152|Who would take it now, after all this?
p303/p303_084|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p303/p303_036|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p303/p303_261|Things were not easy from the outset.
p303/p303_265|I've seen some of the submissions.
p303/p303_201|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p303/p303_069|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p303/p303_277|Last year, however, was a different story.
p303/p303_102|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p303/p303_227|It's been a long, long journey.
p303/p303_211|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p303/p303_127|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p303/p303_216|People are so negative about the whole business.
p303/p303_185|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p303/p303_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p303/p303_284|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p303/p303_338|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p303/p303_142|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p303/p303_260|I believe we have a good chance.
p303/p303_172|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p303/p303_285|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p303/p303_234|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p303/p303_083|His parenthood is called into question.
p303/p303_120|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p303/p303_039|We gave everything we had.
p303/p303_060|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p303/p303_160|They were both delightful to work with.
p303/p303_180|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p303/p303_114|The cold war is over.
p303/p303_316|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p303/p303_197|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p303/p303_157|There is precious little middle ground.
p303/p303_339|Some of his family still live there.
p303/p303_314|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p303/p303_089|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p303/p303_091|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p303/p303_243|How can they engage with the work?
p303/p303_334|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p303/p303_107|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p303/p303_092|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p303/p303_106|The luxury has been well used.
p303/p303_094|Scotland were beaten again.
p303/p303_035|They are interior designers and architects.
p303/p303_053|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p303/p303_199|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p303/p303_061|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p303/p303_170|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p303/p303_210|He had taken everything from me.
p363/p363_217|I was amazed at her knowledge.
p363/p363_070|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p363/p363_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p363/p363_080|All the time, that number was coming down and down.
p363/p363_133|Many other areas are coming up.
p363/p363_111|We are making no comment.
p363/p363_408|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p363/p363_120|It would be really interesting if they did.
p363/p363_398|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p363/p363_117|These people are helpless.
p363/p363_086|That is my preference.
p363/p363_066|Lovely day isn't it?
p363/p363_112|I sit at home a lot.
p363/p363_088|It has come a long way since then.
p363/p363_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p363/p363_170|So what's in store?
p363/p363_195|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p363/p363_394|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p363/p363_047|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p363/p363_061|He is not alone.
p363/p363_220|Ours is on for two days.
p363/p363_303|But they have the sound.
p363/p363_401|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p363/p363_343|Therefore there is a threat.
p363/p363_351|Secondly, there is the question of money.
p363/p363_207|We have still got the fight in us.
p363/p363_311|There is another side to it.
p363/p363_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p363/p363_042|There is a new confidence about the club.
p363/p363_266|Two other men have recovered.
p363/p363_332|We need to regroup.
p363/p363_034|It's not an improvement for him.
p363/p363_124|I welcome this Bill.
p363/p363_105|The play was to go straight ahead.
p363/p363_285|But he was far from alone.
p363/p363_211|A senior party insider said.
p363/p363_264|It's an hour of the same response.
p363/p363_370|And there are others.
p363/p363_267|It will be a challenging film.
p363/p363_397|You can't take a chance.
p363/p363_035|I think it is wide open.
p363/p363_166|My father and mother are.
p363/p363_050|He was very grateful for his health.
p363/p363_090|But someone has got to do it.
p363/p363_375|Just look at his record.
p363/p363_154|His body was never found.
p363/p363_242|It was an excellent performance.
p363/p363_259|It is not a soap opera.
p363/p363_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p363/p363_257|We would like to see them in court.
p363/p363_372|I think we did well.
p363/p363_077|He is slightly confused.
p363/p363_037|It's on with a roller.
p363/p363_235|Will you just put it away?
p363/p363_241|That ignorance is crucial.
p363/p363_131|It is very simple.
p363/p363_072|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p363/p363_414|It's not going to last five minutes.
p363/p363_278|I have a problem with these things.
p363/p363_224|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p363/p363_362|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p363/p363_038|The captaincy will help that, too.
p363/p363_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p363/p363_168|We have been together for five years.
p363/p363_073|It was just an accident.
p363/p363_406|I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
p363/p363_175|Scotland won by six wickets.
p363/p363_268|The test case is still awaiting action.
p363/p363_169|They would never let him go.
p363/p363_185|They were not consulted.
p363/p363_226|That in itself is a joke.
p363/p363_306|It is not just in Edinburgh.
p363/p363_148|It would be a masterclass.
p363/p363_347|Gritty he did not want.
p363/p363_160|He said it was his greatest work.
p363/p363_204|We didn't want any trouble.
p363/p363_231|They chose the latter.
p363/p363_201|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p363/p363_302|It was not the right time for me.
p363/p363_109|It can be very worrying.
p363/p363_422|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
p363/p363_029|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p363/p363_135|There were no reports of casualties.
p363/p363_030|His party never arrived.
p363/p363_349|Nobody was able to escape.
p363/p363_328|The United Nations must act.
p363/p363_213|I think it must be the uniforms.
p363/p363_055|Who will pay for this?
p363/p363_395|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p363/p363_096|Where will the money come from?
p363/p363_373|Only two things are certain.
p363/p363_178|That was a huge experience.
p363/p363_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p363/p363_337|I just had to go for it.
p363/p363_104|It's somewhere in between.
p363/p363_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p363/p363_356|This place is outstanding.
p363/p363_074|We are not commenting at the moment.
p363/p363_299|He will have it within two weeks.
p363/p363_258|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p363/p363_281|Then there was her childhood.
p363/p363_094|What has happened?
p363/p363_254|We stopped at half-time.
p363/p363_157|It appears to have been successful.
p363/p363_232|The legal process could last weeks.
p363/p363_420|Both were reduced to rubble.
p363/p363_234|I can do this on my own.
p363/p363_141|Hard it will be.
p363/p363_336|He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p363/p363_415|I am happy with my form.
p363/p363_200|It was a horrible moment.
p363/p363_190|It was far more important than that.
p363/p363_251|I don't feel like working.
p363/p363_339|I am feeling on top of the world.
p363/p363_048|He will never be forgotten.
p363/p363_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p363/p363_388|I am enjoying it.
p363/p363_138|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p363/p363_078|We did not deserve to go through.
p363/p363_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p363/p363_102|It was entirely justified.
p363/p363_338|It seems to go down well.
p363/p363_419|This is actually true.
p363/p363_151|They will not be going back.
p363/p363_031|Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
p363/p363_087|He later told The Herald, It is true.
p363/p363_288|The Believer isn't just a movie.
p363/p363_129|Look at the turn-out.
p363/p363_089|It was decided he should be dismissed.
p363/p363_182|Now is the time for action.
p363/p363_119|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p363/p363_277|He is certainly not looking for another job.
p363/p363_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p363/p363_376|He was a legend.
p363/p363_319|That would be the constructive way forward.
p363/p363_229|Well, we know now.
p363/p363_295|It should be equal.
p363/p363_143|Maybe it will work there.
p363/p363_172|The German had a point to make.
p363/p363_275|Now we have had enough.
p363/p363_348|The world is being invited to visit.
p363/p363_300|How do you feel?
p363/p363_228|But we shall have to talk to him.
p363/p363_188|THERE's only one word for it.
p363/p363_069|The show is not over.
p363/p363_325|Was this element always there?
p363/p363_390|You have to go for it.
p363/p363_410|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p363/p363_265|This is the root of their problems.
p363/p363_369|We have been overwhelmed by the response.
p363/p363_297|I want to make a difference.
p363/p363_386|I loved it - and so did my friend.
p363/p363_041|The impact was immediate.
p363/p363_165|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p363/p363_378|I have no evidence.
p363/p363_147|I doubt it would be genuine.
p363/p363_210|I wanted to have a go.
p363/p363_403|It is a large number.
p363/p363_405|This is your chance.
p363/p363_139|Changes need to be made.
p363/p363_287|I believe he could have turned it around.
p363/p363_144|How does it all work?
p363/p363_361|It raises a serious question mark.
p363/p363_212|We got on very well.
p363/p363_364|Experience in this work is paramount.
p363/p363_380|We were very unhappy with the incident.
p363/p363_093|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p363/p363_393|It is for the same reason.
p363/p363_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p363/p363_230|He was only doing his job.
p363/p363_404|She doesn't know where to begin.
p363/p363_269|She is under police escort.
p363/p363_219|It was important in training terms.
p363/p363_199|Well, you might have a point.
p363/p363_123|Motorists will welcome this.
p363/p363_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p363/p363_218|Where is the evidence?
p363/p363_081|There is room for me.
p363/p363_396|He will have something to say.
p363/p363_352|He was later deported.
p363/p363_130|Which brings us to the question of money.
p363/p363_180|Will he be here for the weekend?
p363/p363_189|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p363/p363_095|If they are not, the commission will take action.
p363/p363_049|I was not overly concerned about this.
p363/p363_298|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p363/p363_238|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p363/p363_248|He is to be commended.
p363/p363_082|That can only be a good thing.
p363/p363_320|My view has now completely changed.
p363/p363_173|There are two characters.
p363/p363_052|But real life is not like that.
p363/p363_355|One might think that it is a power.
p363/p363_244|Clearly, there was a mix-up.
p363/p363_183|Public safety is paramount.
p363/p363_075|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p363/p363_344|She would love it.
p363/p363_115|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p363/p363_253|I sit in the car.
p363/p363_371|However, it was well worth the wait.
p363/p363_108|He is obviously very dangerous.
p363/p363_065|Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
p363/p363_260|Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
p363/p363_252|Then one day it happened.
p363/p363_054|That is why this action has been taken.
p363/p363_322|You have no chance of planning permission.
p363/p363_091|We have not given up.
p363/p363_177|It is all credit to them today.
p363/p363_381|The challenge is to win a cup.
p363/p363_163|I live for today.
p363/p363_127|He is the man to beat.
p363/p363_333|I must make that clear.
p363/p363_308|It was a deeper deception.
p363/p363_389|It wasn't very pretty to watch.
p363/p363_304|Not all women are dismayed.
p363/p363_128|We are getting not a penny.
p363/p363_263|He was travelling to see his daughter.
p363/p363_156|We have been extremely busy.
p363/p363_367|She had not suffered any physical injury.
p363/p363_363|It was great fun.
p363/p363_159|We still have to wait for that.
p363/p363_196|A decision is expected tomorrow.
p363/p363_261|They may not always be so lucky.
p363/p363_280|The gap is closing.
p363/p363_053|So now we know.
p363/p363_186|He had an apartment ready.
p363/p363_368|We have a business to run.
p363/p363_208|That decision is now being appealed.
p363/p363_033|He gave no other details.
p363/p363_222|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p363/p363_317|Her concerns were not without foundation.
p363/p363_181|He can do everything.
p363/p363_171|He didn't know where to look.
p363/p363_326|This is an awful lot of money.
p363/p363_001|Please call Stella.
p363/p363_101|I can't get it.
p363/p363_249|I can hardly believe it.
p363/p363_067|It was far from business as usual.
p363/p363_227|They know nothing about the sport.
p363/p363_324|He was in a mood.
p363/p363_329|They haven't got a hope.
p363/p363_374|There is nothing to fear.
p363/p363_191|That is European law.
p363/p363_118|I wish him well.
p363/p363_113|That was certainly the case for the parties.
p363/p363_150|I didn't really expect to be called up.
p363/p363_418|Overall, it has certainly worked out.
p363/p363_409|I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
p363/p363_301|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p363/p363_286|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p363/p363_346|You did not see it.
p363/p363_084|They are difficult awards to decide.
p363/p363_318|This decision is a farce.
p363/p363_225|We don't come here for our health.
p363/p363_162|The baby deserves the credit.
p363/p363_391|Are these immoral?
p363/p363_085|It was that kind of war.
p363/p363_233|All were later allowed home.
p363/p363_098|It was good fun.
p363/p363_193|Their appeal will be heard this week.
p363/p363_206|The training will take place in Downing Street.
p363/p363_025|It's never been to committee.
p363/p363_032|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p363/p363_099|This is a great shame.
p363/p363_056|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p363/p363_315|The Old Firm are growing.
p363/p363_126|he announced his plans.
p363/p363_083|I have never seen anything like this.
p363/p363_197|I wanted to get on with it.
p363/p363_305|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p363/p363_309|Norton was delighted with his successes.
p363/p363_236|I think it's more important to have fun.
p363/p363_164|I have been very stupid.
p363/p363_214|This is not a monument to the past.
p363/p363_412|It was not even this century.
p363/p363_203|I really had to concentrate.
p363/p363_059|That is our objective.
p363/p363_334|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p363/p363_392|It has been a massive success.
p363/p363_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p363/p363_245|I have not had much of him.
p363/p363_291|It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
p363/p363_289|You are looking at him.
p363/p363_273|The plot is minimal.
p363/p363_114|I hope the couples are still together.
p363/p363_134|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p363/p363_407|There's nothing she can't do.
p363/p363_107|I am the head.
p363/p363_068|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p363/p363_155|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p363/p363_149|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p363/p363_262|Where was the point in all this?
p363/p363_411|He died in September.
p363/p363_239|I'm so looking forward to it.
p363/p363_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p363/p363_357|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p363/p363_137|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p363/p363_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p363/p363_036|It certainly is cause for concern.
p363/p363_142|I was deeply worried.
p363/p363_184|I feel really confident in that department.
p363/p363_256|All winners should be tested.
p363/p363_071|This is a judgment issue.
p363/p363_294|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p363/p363_416|That's the name of the game, though.
p363/p363_382|It is something that we would support.
p363/p363_051|The nation has his music.
p363/p363_044|It is the strength of the school.
p363/p363_335|I've never regretted coming here.
p363/p363_312|His remit is specific.
p363/p363_192|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p363/p363_272|We're going to fight it.
p363/p363_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p363/p363_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p363/p363_100|We talk about effective military action.
p363/p363_243|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p363/p363_058|We were upset about the referee.
p363/p363_365|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p363/p363_221|We don't want that at all.
p363/p363_045|In my experience, he does not do that.
p363/p363_064|The club is afflicted by injuries.
p363/p363_383|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p363/p363_323|That is taking place in Strathclyde.
p363/p363_293|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p363/p363_110|It's harder, believe me.
p363/p363_103|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p363/p363_330|He was a national treasure.
p363/p363_327|He was the architect.
p363/p363_040|I think we're a long way forward.
p363/p363_039|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p363/p363_152|The progress has been steady.
p363/p363_247|We are taking no chances this time.
p363/p363_307|It's never happened before.
p363/p363_296|It will make a big difference.
p363/p363_276|Can you believe it?
p363/p363_250|The goals will come.
p363/p363_290|The best team won.
p363/p363_216|You are going to have to do it.
p363/p363_092|It was the turning point of the afternoon.
p363/p363_359|They never seem to do anything about it.
p363/p363_146|There's a lot of it going on.
p363/p363_350|Surely the answer is yes.
p363/p363_360|We're going to sleep.
p363/p363_271|That should not be their conclusion.
p363/p363_246|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p363/p363_413|That was really tough.
p363/p363_384|We are in shock.
p363/p363_043|His film is not.
p363/p363_423|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p363/p363_176|Her body has never been found.
p363/p363_122|Sadly, it is not to be.
p363/p363_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p363/p363_284|It was quite a sight.
p363/p363_255|I was brought up in a mining background.
p363/p363_377|It is a memorial.
p363/p363_079|The course has helped a lot.
p363/p363_215|We can all understand that.
p363/p363_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p363/p363_240|I think we can do well.
p363/p363_379|But is he?
p363/p363_125|This is not a problem.
p363/p363_417|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p363/p363_174|The only trouble is finding them.
p363/p363_060|What's the problem?
p363/p363_310|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p363/p363_358|But it is a fact.
p363/p363_026|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p363/p363_136|But it's a subtle process.
p363/p363_345|One was taken to hospital.
p363/p363_292|It was an achievement all right.
p363/p363_209|This is really good news for us.
p363/p363_313|It will be very damaging for research.
p363/p363_282|Other people had looked at it.
p363/p363_385|Does it really matter?
p363/p363_198|I don't think it's the area.
p363/p363_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p363/p363_167|But that was his nature.
p363/p363_316|They want to win the title.
p363/p363_283|And the other winners are.
p363/p363_354|I am not sure.
p363/p363_057|There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
p363/p363_076|Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
p363/p363_028|The proposals were not new.
p363/p363_353|I only found out about it this morning.
p363/p363_097|She is still very poorly.
p363/p363_145|We could easily have lost that game.
p363/p363_314|I'm a bit overwhelmed.
p363/p363_121|That takes a lot of courage.
p363/p363_063|There wasn't anything in it.
p363/p363_402|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p363/p363_223|The group will report back in the summer.
p363/p363_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p363/p363_366|It is not needed, it should go.
p363/p363_116|But that is not enough.
p363/p363_421|It could have taken another two months.
p363/p363_027|It was actually very, very difficult.
p363/p363_158|This is a big game for them.
p363/p363_140|Things are going well.
p363/p363_132|There was something special about that.
p363/p363_046|That is good news.
p363/p363_062|He did that last Sunday.
p363/p363_237|By then it was too late.
p363/p363_399|There is a lack of logic.
p363/p363_187|The prime minister will make the decision.
p363/p363_205|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p363/p363_106|He had never run the distance before.
p363/p363_321|It was blown out of proportion.
p363/p363_274|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p363/p363_194|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p363/p363_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p363/p363_202|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p363/p363_341|I don't know, really.
p363/p363_387|A decision is expected today.
p363/p363_179|Perhaps it was just as well.
p363/p363_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p363/p363_270|However, that is not in itself enough.
p363/p363_331|I think they are right to be impatient.
p363/p363_153|It has no chance.
p363/p363_161|I feel a little betrayed.
p269/p269_131|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p269/p269_068|You need a trademark.
p269/p269_227|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p269/p269_139|What will happen then?
p269/p269_321|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p269/p269_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p269/p269_379|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p269/p269_191|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p269/p269_296|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p269/p269_202|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p269/p269_111|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p269/p269_158|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p269/p269_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p269/p269_219|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p269/p269_176|They thought they had found a home.
p269/p269_115|Maybe this battle has been.
p269/p269_254|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p269/p269_297|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p269/p269_064|They are real.
p269/p269_183|Everyone can be bought.
p269/p269_177|His team management was protective.
p269/p269_330|Kids are terrible.
p269/p269_162|His death was a tragic accident.
p269/p269_283|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p269/p269_357|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p269/p269_147|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p269/p269_060|They're appalled by that.
p269/p269_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p269/p269_350|It is a sign of hope.
p269/p269_373|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p269/p269_271|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p269/p269_190|Does this matter?
p269/p269_277|They wanted the club to make money.
p269/p269_281|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p269/p269_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p269/p269_200|We played them off the pitch.
p269/p269_096|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p269/p269_072|There could be a way back.
p269/p269_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p269/p269_323|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p269/p269_338|I came into this world with nothing.
p269/p269_212|Feel the heat?
p269/p269_073|I was as strong as a horse.
p269/p269_130|So the European elections are extremely important.
p269/p269_263|I am very angry.
p269/p269_241|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p269/p269_116|My office is bare.
p269/p269_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p269/p269_333|The problems began a long time ago.
p269/p269_129|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p269/p269_239|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p269/p269_328|We are a peaceful people.
p269/p269_175|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p269/p269_071|It's a winner.
p269/p269_220|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p269/p269_036|A web site is planned for November.
p269/p269_308|Graeme was prepared.
p269/p269_047|Who can say?
p269/p269_233|But she was.
p269/p269_349|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p269/p269_082|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p269/p269_235|And thought we would get away with it.
p269/p269_059|Art is extra.
p269/p269_303|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p269/p269_045|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p269/p269_055|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p269/p269_084|That is bound to happen.
p269/p269_201|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p269/p269_389|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p269/p269_391|If you look at the other galleries in this area.
p269/p269_057|None has ever been found.
p269/p269_103|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p269/p269_061|There was a battle there.
p269/p269_223|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p269/p269_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p269/p269_247|You can feel at home in China.
p269/p269_265|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p269/p269_167|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p269/p269_157|He will emerge as a world leader.
p269/p269_381|It is a large number.
p269/p269_109|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p269/p269_127|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p269/p269_317|It's just not funny!
p269/p269_155|It would be a last resort.
p269/p269_134|We had a reunion last week.
p269/p269_160|We want to see the maximum of change.
p269/p269_253|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p269/p269_393|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p269/p269_284|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p269/p269_028|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p269/p269_026|But it failed.
p269/p269_136|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p269/p269_101|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p269/p269_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p269/p269_343|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p269/p269_100|May not have been at fault?
p269/p269_029|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p269/p269_310|But it's a subtle process.
p269/p269_250|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p269/p269_266|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p269/p269_053|We have not given up hope.
p269/p269_063|It's that kind of place.
p269/p269_340|There was no time scale.
p269/p269_259|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p269/p269_299|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p269/p269_214|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p269/p269_163|This latter point is hugely important.
p269/p269_104|No date has been set for the appeal.
p269/p269_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p269/p269_140|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p269/p269_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p269/p269_346|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p269/p269_174|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p269/p269_327|I was rubbish.
p269/p269_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p269/p269_309|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p269/p269_117|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p269/p269_067|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p269/p269_040|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p269/p269_124|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p269/p269_188|Four policemen were wounded.
p269/p269_062|Scotland had great assets.
p269/p269_154|It's like a football team.
p269/p269_236|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p269/p269_112|It was the eighties.
p269/p269_206|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p269/p269_118|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p269/p269_384|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p269/p269_295|This is a national crisis.
p269/p269_076|It is a job creation scheme.
p269/p269_272|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p269/p269_172|I lost my head.
p269/p269_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p269/p269_286|If not, he should go home.
p269/p269_255|I can't get a job.
p269/p269_085|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p269/p269_145|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p269/p269_331|Henman has been warned.
p269/p269_046|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p269/p269_030|I have a theory.
p269/p269_374|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p269/p269_218|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p269/p269_360|It should be scrapped.
p269/p269_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p269/p269_279|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p269/p269_347|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p269/p269_249|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p269/p269_143|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p269/p269_198|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p269/p269_335|They had a confession.
p269/p269_086|All options are open.
p269/p269_356|It was so new, so exciting.
p269/p269_187|They will run a mile.
p269/p269_087|Someone who cares
p269/p269_364|As, indeed, they would be.
p269/p269_386|You can cope with it.
p269/p269_151|We have seen a copy of the report.
p269/p269_146|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p269/p269_052|It's very odd.
p269/p269_133|Twaddle is a case in point.
p269/p269_038|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p269/p269_237|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p269/p269_108|It was quite rigorous.
p269/p269_261|Kirkwood was arrested.
p269/p269_240|It's quite nice.
p269/p269_306|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p269/p269_125|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p269/p269_074|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p269/p269_319|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p269/p269_354|You feel the pride.
p269/p269_383|They haven't got a hope.
p269/p269_288|I saw it at a ruck.
p269/p269_225|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p269/p269_216|I am delighted for Simon.
p269/p269_078|He is now resident in England.
p269/p269_322|I did not name it.
p269/p269_385|He denied the charge.
p269/p269_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p269/p269_039|That's no bad thing.
p269/p269_348|It's been hard.
p269/p269_080|People must remain vigilant.
p269/p269_312|There is no openness.
p269/p269_324|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p269/p269_185|They know no other way.
p269/p269_075|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p269/p269_273|It left me with a sadness.
p269/p269_376|He could face a jail sentence.
p269/p269_403|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p269/p269_097|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p269/p269_171|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p269/p269_091|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p269/p269_114|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p269/p269_372|It's a true story.
p269/p269_169|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p269/p269_278|It's a way of life.
p269/p269_099|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p269/p269_069|Painful, but only because it's true.
p269/p269_316|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p269/p269_079|Even the one she loved.
p269/p269_307|I was the sheep.
p269/p269_150|She died at her home.
p269/p269_378|They have not done so this season so far.
p269/p269_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p269/p269_166|I've put my own money into this project.
p269/p269_032|Because we do not need it.
p269/p269_301|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p269/p269_291|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p269/p269_294|It's like a high school play.
p269/p269_258|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p269/p269_037|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p269/p269_161|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p269/p269_368|We will be homeless.
p269/p269_070|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p269/p269_361|It is long gone.
p269/p269_298|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p269/p269_083|I'd like to continue that record.
p269/p269_320|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p269/p269_358|A great deal has been achieved.
p269/p269_149|We just had a go.
p269/p269_395|It is unusual.
p269/p269_238|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p269/p269_270|They are never here.
p269/p269_195|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p269/p269_196|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p269/p269_371|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p269/p269_276|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p269/p269_339|That's the law of the land.
p269/p269_252|I should think so, too.
p269/p269_179|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p269/p269_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p269/p269_208|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p269/p269_092|The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
p269/p269_056|We are a grandmother.
p269/p269_144|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p269/p269_248|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p269/p269_274|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p269/p269_224|Who was on the panel?
p269/p269_066|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p269/p269_209|But I am a worried man.
p269/p269_153|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p269/p269_398|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p269/p269_035|Help is needed.
p269/p269_402|The car was just there.
p269/p269_397|I suspect the latter.
p269/p269_231|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p269/p269_365|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p269/p269_230|I'd never seen a play about me.
p269/p269_313|They are wrong.
p269/p269_282|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p269/p269_213|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p269/p269_326|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p269/p269_121|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p269/p269_093|Today I couldn't run on it.
p269/p269_042|I was scared.
p269/p269_089|You will be.
p269/p269_304|A new school will be built.
p269/p269_170|We have to move forward.
p269/p269_094|They've got to account for it.
p269/p269_081|This is the way things should be handled.
p269/p269_380|They play together perfectly.
p269/p269_050|I was inspired by two things.
p269/p269_106|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p269/p269_203|It was good fun.
p269/p269_234|It's like a basketball.
p269/p269_222|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p269/p269_399|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p269/p269_353|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p269/p269_377|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p269/p269_105|It's not perfect.
p269/p269_275|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p269/p269_088|By then, he was walking on water.
p269/p269_189|We did everything by the book.
p269/p269_244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p269/p269_049|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p269/p269_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
p269/p269_077|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p269/p269_269|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p269/p269_242|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p269/p269_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p269/p269_392|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p269/p269_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p269/p269_128|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p269/p269_210|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p269/p269_058|You do not change overnight.
p269/p269_197|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p269/p269_268|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p269/p269_152|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p269/p269_182|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p269/p269_215|I began to pray.
p269/p269_387|I am very happy with life.
p269/p269_388|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p269/p269_159|I was so nervous.
p269/p269_401|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p269/p269_264|It is also very valuable.
p269/p269_165|It is an attitude of mind.
p269/p269_267|The warning is timely.
p269/p269_051|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p269/p269_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p269/p269_098|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p269/p269_194|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p269/p269_113|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p269/p269_293|Who will perform?
p269/p269_126|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p269/p269_142|It's a question of fashion.
p269/p269_173|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p269/p269_207|I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
p269/p269_044|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p269/p269_329|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p269/p269_345|I'd like to take the plunge.
p269/p269_336|In the old days, it was easy.
p269/p269_315|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p269/p269_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p269/p269_156|That group reported just before Christmas.
p269/p269_228|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p269/p269_229|I have spoken to the skipper.
p269/p269_287|They were too hard.
p269/p269_102|Oil embargo endorsed.
p269/p269_292|It was a virus.
p269/p269_257|Special measures were needed.
p269/p269_245|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p269/p269_400|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p269/p269_226|It's so special.
p269/p269_132|Who will attend?
p269/p269_001|Please call Stella.
p269/p269_090|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p269/p269_168|I am now unemployed.
p269/p269_396|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p269/p269_138|If not, a deal could take many months.
p269/p269_256|It is nearly there.
p269/p269_033|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p269/p269_362|I HAVE a dream.
p269/p269_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p269/p269_375|The play is based on a real-life event.
p269/p269_204|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p269/p269_065|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p269/p269_305|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p269/p269_180|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p269/p269_122|She has been shot.
p269/p269_280|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p269/p269_199|The conference is the first test.
p269/p269_366|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p269/p269_355|The train was on time.
p269/p269_342|Is there a new way forward?
p269/p269_148|He is severe.
p269/p269_137|It's the big omission.
p269/p269_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p269/p269_031|Is this accurate?
p269/p269_110|I can't even get into the A team.
p269/p269_211|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p269/p269_302|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p269/p269_184|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p269/p269_311|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p269/p269_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p269/p269_341|It is a strong case.
p269/p269_205|It's all about money, money, money.
p269/p269_123|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p269/p269_394|I'm pleased about one thing.
p269/p269_246|I know I'm in a very special position.
p269/p269_334|Referees are easy targets.
p269/p269_041|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p269/p269_221|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p269/p269_370|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p269/p269_186|It's an idea.
p269/p269_217|It had all been arranged.
p269/p269_300|It changed my life.
p269/p269_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p269/p269_193|It had been in place since last July.
p269/p269_290|You've got to have both sides.
p269/p269_181|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p269/p269_289|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p269/p269_048|He had no enemies.
p269/p269_367|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p269/p269_135|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p269/p269_369|I expected these kind of questions.
p269/p269_359|It was forced to divert.
p269/p269_344|The boat was fantastic.
p269/p269_260|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p269/p269_363|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p269/p269_232|My neighbours are horrified.
p269/p269_382|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p269/p269_243|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p269/p269_314|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p269/p269_352|It has moved on in the last week.
p269/p269_332|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p269/p269_251|I was shocked.
p269/p269_141|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p269/p269_285|It happens from time to time.
p269/p269_119|It was a delight on every level.
p269/p269_164|It is so unfair.
p269/p269_325|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p269/p269_107|He pleaded for caution.
p269/p269_337|However, the groups denied the claims.
p269/p269_054|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p269/p269_043|It was ugly.
p269/p269_318|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p269/p269_027|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p225/p225_277|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p225/p225_310|What are they for?
p225/p225_238|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p225/p225_111|It isn't a happy memory.
p225/p225_291|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p225/p225_025|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p225/p225_104|His is a success story by any standard.
p225/p225_040|You'd better believe it.
p225/p225_158|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p225/p225_072|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p225/p225_243|The irony was not lost.
p225/p225_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p225/p225_120|The industry is not well organised.
p225/p225_071|He is in the queue.
p225/p225_282|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
p225/p225_212|After that nothing could save him.
p225/p225_108|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p225/p225_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p225/p225_264|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p225/p225_223|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p225/p225_090|I did not have a bet on myself.
p225/p225_328|It is just a tax on employment.
p225/p225_286|I wanted to change the formula.
p225/p225_159|Neither side can win this war.
p225/p225_063|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p225/p225_037|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p225/p225_318|The problem was he thought you were a big man.
p225/p225_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p225/p225_133|I think he's the favourite.
p225/p225_073|So, did she meet him?
p225/p225_354|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p225/p225_237|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p225/p225_303|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p225/p225_242|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p225/p225_290|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p225/p225_351|After the match, do you?
p225/p225_035|A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
p225/p225_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p225/p225_058|However, the problem is the timing.
p225/p225_355|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p225/p225_150|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p225/p225_084|He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
p225/p225_240|We are in the hat.
p225/p225_257|My son was too young to die.
p225/p225_346|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p225/p225_281|They were not at the property yesterday.
p225/p225_289|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p225/p225_330|We are a peaceful people.
p225/p225_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p225/p225_331|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p225/p225_144|She will do for me.
p225/p225_177|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p225/p225_201|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p225/p225_153|We have a clean bill of health.
p225/p225_165|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p225/p225_029|What do we do?
p225/p225_352|He was then replaced by Ross.
p225/p225_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p225/p225_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p225/p225_275|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p225/p225_274|We have not reached the point of no return.
p225/p225_297|Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
p225/p225_236|That will be the criteria for the future.
p225/p225_038|Diving is no part of football.
p225/p225_268|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p225/p225_175|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p225/p225_365|You did not see it.
p225/p225_028|Do I have a favourite?
p225/p225_149|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p225/p225_298|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p225/p225_348|Does it matter?
p225/p225_208|You are a great player.
p225/p225_350|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p225/p225_358|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p225/p225_173|But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
p225/p225_131|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p225/p225_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p225/p225_094|That's as it should be.
p225/p225_176|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p225/p225_329|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p225/p225_089|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p225/p225_118|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p225/p225_308|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p225/p225_334|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p225/p225_315|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p225/p225_070|That is bound to happen.
p225/p225_195|It is hard to tell.
p225/p225_266|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p225/p225_086|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p225/p225_359|But we welcome this document.
p225/p225_241|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p225/p225_325|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p225/p225_196|I think, therefore I am?
p225/p225_239|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p225/p225_001|Please call Stella.
p225/p225_199|And they were being paid?
p225/p225_027|So is that it, then?
p225/p225_179|They know no other way.
p225/p225_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p225/p225_312|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p225/p225_039|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p225/p225_335|We are in the end game.
p225/p225_030|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p225/p225_200|It looked like a river.
p225/p225_060|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p225/p225_135|We have seen a copy of the report.
p225/p225_157|He was asked to quit.
p225/p225_166|Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
p225/p225_353|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p225/p225_052|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p225/p225_203|They have the cash and the fire power.
p225/p225_317|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p225/p225_059|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p225/p225_113|The big issue for us is the review.
p225/p225_299|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p225/p225_128|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p225/p225_220|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p225/p225_053|I have made that offer.
p225/p225_193|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p225/p225_324|There is no plan B.
p225/p225_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p225/p225_123|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p225/p225_142|Well, you can have a tree.
p225/p225_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p225/p225_192|However, this idea is never developed.
p225/p225_147|Does the name matter?
p225/p225_319|There's still a bit to go.
p225/p225_026|How are you, sir?
p225/p225_117|We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
p225/p225_224|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p225/p225_051|We are committed to the ban.
p225/p225_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p225/p225_092|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p225/p225_296|It goes back a long way.
p225/p225_082|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p225/p225_191|People will ask about us.
p225/p225_127|It is a common problem.
p225/p225_235|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p225/p225_322|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p225/p225_225|It is good for our team.
p225/p225_347|Boy is the town a mess.
p225/p225_083|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p225/p225_114|I told him I was a long time ago.
p225/p225_116|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p225/p225_182|We are just glad to be alive.
p225/p225_302|Three hours later, the man was free.
p225/p225_122|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p225/p225_151|Nothing has been put into action.
p225/p225_244|What was the matter for concern?
p225/p225_295|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p225/p225_258|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p225/p225_276|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p225/p225_049|I have learned from him.
p225/p225_109|That might help a bit.
p225/p225_300|I can hardly believe it.
p225/p225_171|The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
p225/p225_057|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p225/p225_033|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p225/p225_169|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p225/p225_356|I said he was set to retire.
p225/p225_273|He has not created a Festival resource.
p225/p225_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p225/p225_221|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p225/p225_285|We have to break that cycle.
p225/p225_222|In each case they were a goal down.
p225/p225_279|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p225/p225_301|I must do something about it.
p225/p225_326|He will go a long way.
p225/p225_197|Who was she?
p225/p225_067|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p225/p225_218|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p225/p225_248|Does that put pressure on us?
p225/p225_044|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p225/p225_357|It is a sign of hope.
p225/p225_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p225/p225_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p225/p225_115|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p225/p225_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p225/p225_081|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p225/p225_349|How do you take them away?
p225/p225_254|The problem was a social problem.
p225/p225_136|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p225/p225_121|You get a lot for your money.
p225/p225_124|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p225/p225_210|Scotland will play its part.
p225/p225_309|Are they free?
p225/p225_305|Cast Away now on general release.
p225/p225_172|Nobody did in those days.
p225/p225_065|There is no pressure on us.
p225/p225_066|It is a job creation scheme.
p225/p225_126|The squad is too small.
p225/p225_211|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p225/p225_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p225/p225_314|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p225/p225_287|She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
p225/p225_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p225/p225_156|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p225/p225_143|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p225/p225_056|Clearly, it can go either way.
p225/p225_054|Four other charges were dropped.
p225/p225_265|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p225/p225_045|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p225/p225_062|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p225/p225_103|Everyone deserves to share in this success.
p225/p225_366|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p225/p225_061|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p225/p225_336|I came into this world with nothing.
p225/p225_294|However, we had no failures in our side.
p225/p225_145|Why change it?
p225/p225_110|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p225/p225_320|We have a good healthy debate.
p225/p225_323|It is a court case.
p225/p225_174|He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
p225/p225_141|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p225/p225_293|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p225/p225_363|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p225/p225_332|It's difficult to predict the future.
p225/p225_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p225/p225_152|The weather forecast isn't good.
p225/p225_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p225/p225_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p225/p225_253|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p225/p225_036|It was a close call.
p225/p225_337|But they have the sound.
p225/p225_046|No details of the talks were given.
p225/p225_064|It could take some time.
p225/p225_280|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p225/p225_202|The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
p225/p225_219|They did not attack the themes of the book.
p225/p225_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p225/p225_316|It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
p345/p345_219|I am going to fight to the end.
p345/p345_225|I can't get away from it.
p345/p345_168|But it won't be the same.
p345/p345_206|Then another one came.
p345/p345_180|They have known the hard times.
p345/p345_142|Scotland has lost a great man.
p345/p345_288|My wife is coming over at the weekend.
p345/p345_177|That will be the case.
p345/p345_333|I might get an injury very easily.
p345/p345_320|It is a symbolic concert.
p345/p345_178|Now, it's all right.
p345/p345_375|Suddenly, there was an audience.
p345/p345_144|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p345/p345_313|They were not missing much.
p345/p345_321|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p345/p345_221|It's the right thing.
p345/p345_124|It is sad and frustrating.
p345/p345_129|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p345/p345_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p345/p345_202|But who is the killer?
p345/p345_275|Anyone else can apply.
p345/p345_316|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p345/p345_379|And therein lies the problem.
p345/p345_147|It plainly does not work.
p345/p345_062|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p345/p345_226|I believe in the Union.
p345/p345_332|Five years later, the deception continued.
p345/p345_044|Who wants to be a Millionaire?
p345/p345_163|IT takes the biscuit.
p345/p345_213|I want to put myself on discussion also.
p345/p345_093|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p345/p345_134|The shooting created panic in the street.
p345/p345_056|We expect them to deliver for us.
p345/p345_046|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p345/p345_189|We've seen that time and time again.
p345/p345_246|I am appalled by this news.
p345/p345_043|However, there were some alarming findings.
p345/p345_331|We will win the argument.
p345/p345_116|Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
p345/p345_146|For some, it was more painful than others.
p345/p345_269|It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
p345/p345_234|That is not an easy thing.
p345/p345_087|They should come clean.
p345/p345_351|There was no discussion about it.
p345/p345_370|I don't believe a word of it.
p345/p345_308|I can't say anything about any figure.
p345/p345_261|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p345/p345_064|There will be no threat to the game.
p345/p345_188|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p345/p345_162|I suggest a new plan.
p345/p345_319|Is she in trouble?
p345/p345_371|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p345/p345_072|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p345/p345_032|I am prepared to step down.
p345/p345_243|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p345/p345_314|It should not make the same mistake again.
p345/p345_257|But the foundations have been laid.
p345/p345_312|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p345/p345_384|They are appealing for witnesses.
p345/p345_034|We had to laugh.
p345/p345_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p345/p345_348|I just know it's a lot.
p345/p345_061|The classes are taking place.
p345/p345_196|Business has never been so bad.
p345/p345_296|I said, What was that about?
p345/p345_354|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p345/p345_194|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p345/p345_187|It's all too early.
p345/p345_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p345/p345_155|It may have been a cry for help.
p345/p345_183|They had seven children.
p345/p345_271|They've been at it for five hours.
p345/p345_025|This is a new era.
p345/p345_249|It is understood he had been stabbed.
p345/p345_359|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p345/p345_236|I didn't know where they were.
p345/p345_026|I want to go home.
p345/p345_268|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p345/p345_120|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p345/p345_068|We were caught out.
p345/p345_089|I believe that so strongly.
p345/p345_140|It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
p345/p345_262|But this is different.
p345/p345_270|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p345/p345_220|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p345/p345_063|The sleeper was six hours late.
p345/p345_242|Surely it should be the other way round.
p345/p345_080|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p345/p345_253|THE waiting game continues.
p345/p345_092|They don't work anymore anyway.
p345/p345_364|The Government would be ready, they said.
p345/p345_352|Three hours later, the man was free.
p345/p345_391|There is ample evidence.
p345/p345_329|His father said, My son was lucky.
p345/p345_235|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p345/p345_317|It's always a dilemma.
p345/p345_173|It was like a kick in the belly.
p345/p345_114|Let's get it on.
p345/p345_305|I didn't know she could do that.
p345/p345_035|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p345/p345_216|And we will do it.
p345/p345_083|What happens next?
p345/p345_304|This club have been fair to me.
p345/p345_326|I was waiting for that question.
p345/p345_165|We don't have a solution to the problem.
p345/p345_341|This is his first movie.
p345/p345_248|It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
p345/p345_278|But that is about to change.
p345/p345_121|He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
p345/p345_145|His name has not been released.
p345/p345_259|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p345/p345_337|I'm very happy tonight.
p345/p345_353|It was a very big win for us.
p345/p345_280|We can build on that.
p345/p345_338|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p345/p345_272|This action could have been avoided.
p345/p345_095|He was at it again yesterday.
p345/p345_265|That will not change.
p345/p345_301|It will be extremely difficult for him.
p345/p345_214|It happens in real life.
p345/p345_217|It's a human tragedy.
p345/p345_279|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p345/p345_141|I don't have any perspective on it.
p345/p345_065|It would be a last resort.
p345/p345_040|Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
p345/p345_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p345/p345_229|It will be all about the Olympics.
p345/p345_310|That goes back a long way.
p345/p345_386|It is quite simple.
p345/p345_399|It was still there last night.
p345/p345_376|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p345/p345_378|I did not name it.
p345/p345_167|The result is utterly compelling.
p345/p345_031|It's an amazing landscape!
p345/p345_244|I get on him, he gets on me.
p345/p345_027|All the people here are local.
p345/p345_233|The game was up.
p345/p345_263|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p345/p345_091|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p345/p345_306|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p345/p345_131|It certainly should not be used too often.
p345/p345_255|I don't think he was being very fair.
p345/p345_303|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p345/p345_161|I have a great respect for her.
p345/p345_067|Who would have known.
p345/p345_252|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p345/p345_325|I am very happy with him.
p345/p345_191|It's not only my respect for them.
p345/p345_309|A counter reaction was.
p345/p345_088|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p345/p345_048|The opposite is the case.
p345/p345_294|But they miss the whole point.
p345/p345_182|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p345/p345_195|I never want to have any children.
p345/p345_170|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p345/p345_136|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p345/p345_367|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p345/p345_135|He would just say it was terrible.
p345/p345_297|Immediate action must be taken.
p345/p345_350|I am very happy.
p345/p345_347|I made a big mistake.
p345/p345_282|We are not going to be complacent.
p345/p345_390|His instructions were clear.
p345/p345_138|I was on my own.
p345/p345_166|Miller was every bit as happy.
p345/p345_057|He was between people and God.
p345/p345_218|But we are losing that connection.
p345/p345_204|Things were so intense in the studio.
p345/p345_075|The defender made an impressive debut.
p345/p345_250|It's too much work.
p345/p345_307|This is too much like Scotland.
p345/p345_071|I had to lie.
p345/p345_323|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p345/p345_050|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p345/p345_284|His body was found in May.
p345/p345_159|However, he did not stay there very long.
p345/p345_274|And they still have the final to come.
p345/p345_285|He's a joy to follow.
p345/p345_239|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p345/p345_328|I am not against a further inquiry.
p345/p345_228|But he is not hopeful.
p345/p345_100|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p345/p345_102|There's something about being cut off.
p345/p345_082|It is a freedom.
p345/p345_300|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p345/p345_346|Spent three months alone at sea.
p345/p345_336|I just want to do the good work.
p345/p345_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p345/p345_074|How do we get more people in?
p345/p345_258|We're looking for unity in the council.
p345/p345_113|I have been thinking about that this week.
p345/p345_097|So far this season this approach is working.
p345/p345_393|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p345/p345_260|What is so unusual about this case?
p345/p345_237|Rangers are my life.
p345/p345_148|His words were not audible.
p345/p345_200|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p345/p345_344|We live in shorthand.
p345/p345_070|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p345/p345_368|Anything that was going, really.
p345/p345_392|It was a game we had to win.
p345/p345_374|This is bound to happen.
p345/p345_360|It is not simple.
p345/p345_041|You've got to be vigilant.
p345/p345_190|I was never alone with her, right?
p345/p345_079|He would have loved it.
p345/p345_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p345/p345_315|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p345/p345_055|Others said he had gone too far.
p345/p345_085|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p345/p345_210|But it is looking very positive.
p345/p345_175|We should have gone solo.
p345/p345_287|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p345/p345_201|It was too close to call.
p345/p345_045|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p345/p345_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p345/p345_126|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p345/p345_396|There is still a long way to go.
p345/p345_123|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p345/p345_176|Directing, if you like.
p345/p345_289|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p345/p345_066|That is part of athletics.
p345/p345_081|It was that kind of afternoon.
p345/p345_099|It has to work.
p345/p345_118|We just want a fair deal.
p345/p345_383|Is he going to look after them?
p345/p345_028|The racist abuse was terrible.
p345/p345_335|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p345/p345_106|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p345/p345_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p345/p345_197|There is no way to do this.
p345/p345_198|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p345/p345_277|It was like the old days.
p345/p345_184|That in itself is an erotic experience.
p345/p345_251|We were extremely arrogant.
p345/p345_365|Her life is now back on track.
p345/p345_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p345/p345_143|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p345/p345_343|No one would believe him.
p345/p345_174|Bombing is the easy option.
p345/p345_132|The whole matter is done and dusted.
p345/p345_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p345/p345_086|He insisted that his staff were too.
p345/p345_084|All our futures will already have been decided.
p345/p345_033|It's a lot of pressure on me.
p345/p345_030|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p345/p345_298|This could prove a problem.
p345/p345_369|He will take it in his stride.
p345/p345_267|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p345/p345_334|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p345/p345_104|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p345/p345_355|Everything is up for grabs.
p345/p345_356|We had a good time.
p345/p345_179|All will be revealed in due course.
p345/p345_299|I was a local hero.
p345/p345_130|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p345/p345_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p345/p345_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p345/p345_103|This is his personal life.
p345/p345_193|This is a very high price.
p345/p345_398|This was a unique election.
p345/p345_199|I know my sons.
p345/p345_223|Must have been at the bar.
p345/p345_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p345/p345_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p345/p345_212|He would have come into the house.
p345/p345_036|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p345/p345_240|There are two options.
p345/p345_339|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p345/p345_264|It doesn't look good.
p345/p345_322|It is a very beautiful city.
p345/p345_241|I can't describe it.
p345/p345_042|You can see how he made his money.
p345/p345_230|They are very frightened.
p345/p345_256|You've got to fight to stay up.
p345/p345_208|Everything has been destroyed.
p345/p345_109|What are they like?
p345/p345_397|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p345/p345_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p345/p345_125|Our intentions are real.
p345/p345_358|This was a good performance.
p345/p345_254|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p345/p345_158|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p345/p345_373|The winner will be announced in December.
p345/p345_330|WHO would have thought it?
p345/p345_156|But the damage had been done.
p345/p345_052|It's a question of fashion.
p345/p345_394|To begin with it looks good.
p345/p345_209|The Lobby is not failing.
p345/p345_349|I saw one body.
p345/p345_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p345/p345_171|It is a hobby for me.
p345/p345_150|See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
p345/p345_372|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p345/p345_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p345/p345_380|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p345/p345_096|You can't go on forever.
p345/p345_157|No, you couldn't make it up.
p345/p345_164|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p345/p345_037|I was completely knackered.
p345/p345_400|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p345/p345_111|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p345/p345_377|The letters are going out today.
p345/p345_232|This is my homeland.
p345/p345_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p345/p345_049|Who would be a referee?
p345/p345_231|We have all been there at some point.
p345/p345_133|I don't know where that one came from.
p345/p345_128|She has left the island.
p345/p345_115|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p345/p345_059|They were willing us to get a second.
p345/p345_362|Our task is to complete the picture.
p345/p345_361|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p345/p345_053|I could never be cool.
p345/p345_101|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p345/p345_222|That was a disgraceful performance.
p345/p345_292|My life has been turned upside down.
p345/p345_286|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p345/p345_039|A killer is also on the loose.
p345/p345_293|Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
p345/p345_181|We don't know what happened.
p345/p345_054|We will be paying agency rates.
p345/p345_203|No, it's never been mentioned.
p345/p345_047|His record with England was not good.
p345/p345_137|That's not fair to the supporters.
p345/p345_078|I have nothing to lose.
p345/p345_153|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p345/p345_127|Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
p345/p345_318|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p345/p345_117|It is really good news.
p345/p345_245|This is wonderful news.
p345/p345_291|I don't think we could have expected better.
p345/p345_207|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p345/p345_389|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p345/p345_366|I said at the time it was wrong.
p345/p345_385|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p345/p345_295|You have to count on other people.
p345/p345_281|It could be a danger.
p345/p345_038|I'd rather be singing Verdi.
p345/p345_119|I'll just have to live with that.
p345/p345_340|Now it was serious.
p345/p345_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p345/p345_152|I still think he will win.
p345/p345_112|He had a moustache.
p345/p345_205|The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
p345/p345_172|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p345/p345_151|It was even worse than at home.
p345/p345_395|I won't go back to Holland.
p345/p345_382|Or is it?
p345/p345_324|But could it afford to run it?
p345/p345_186|You have a plan?
p345/p345_090|That, though, is an old story.
p345/p345_094|It was a funny feeling.
p345/p345_060|No casualties were reported.
p345/p345_311|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p345/p345_169|Other forces were, however, at work.
p345/p345_149|That's a huge amount.
p345/p345_073|Everyone was writing me off.
p345/p345_247|No injuries were reported.
p345/p345_345|But something has been lost in the translation.
p345/p345_051|It was time to act.
p345/p345_029|What is the new religion?
p345/p345_290|It starts to get you down.
p345/p345_273|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p345/p345_357|I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
p345/p345_215|At the time, he was a living legend.
p345/p345_160|And so they have.
p345/p345_238|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p345/p345_276|He looked like a schoolboy.
p345/p345_139|They were part of our own family.
p345/p345_105|If not, a deal could take many months.
p345/p345_227|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p345/p345_058|I've never seen anything like it.
p345/p345_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p345/p345_107|I was going to help with the dinner.
p345/p345_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p345/p345_076|But her parents will never see her again.
p345/p345_154|Normally it would be four minutes.
p345/p345_381|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p345/p345_069|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p345/p345_077|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p345/p345_302|It's a gigantic con.
p345/p345_108|Would you pay to come and see it?
p345/p345_192|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p345/p345_211|Drugs are getting through.
p345/p345_185|Death is outside the language.
p345/p345_342|He is already in place.
p345/p345_224|But this is just the start.
p345/p345_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p345/p345_001|Please call Stella.
p345/p345_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p345/p345_122|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p345/p345_283|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p345/p345_098|However, his involvement was instant.
p345/p345_327|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p345/p345_363|It is a road of death.
p345/p345_110|I would probably have to agree with him.
p317/p317_114|The working families tax credit is far better.
p317/p317_154|We told them in June.
p317/p317_055|New potential dangers were emerging.
p317/p317_147|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p317/p317_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p317/p317_296|Some were close to tears.
p317/p317_376|I think it was briefly considered.
p317/p317_331|It is still with Ministers.
p317/p317_127|Hear what they have to say.
p317/p317_071|I've come here for the jersey.
p317/p317_355|What's a boy to do?
p317/p317_371|I am so lucky for that.
p317/p317_384|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p317/p317_235|They showed a lot of heart.
p317/p317_413|The parents will have a great time, too.
p317/p317_031|Is the war over?
p317/p317_041|Overall, however, these were also down.
p317/p317_192|He said that this is beautiful.
p317/p317_034|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p317/p317_333|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p317/p317_411|This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
p317/p317_345|That never seemed likely.
p317/p317_256|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p317/p317_070|And what does it cost, and who is paying?
p317/p317_369|The actors just have to say so.
p317/p317_419|Neither side can win this war.
p317/p317_287|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p317/p317_340|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p317/p317_403|However, the groups denied the claims.
p317/p317_100|But don't worry just yet.
p317/p317_304|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p317/p317_191|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p317/p317_169|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p317/p317_094|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p317/p317_399|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p317/p317_326|Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
p317/p317_083|That would open the gates of hell.
p317/p317_202|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p317/p317_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p317/p317_184|The police were called in.
p317/p317_286|Blood samples were taken.
p317/p317_206|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p317/p317_422|Appointments should be made on merit.
p317/p317_082|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p317/p317_038|We see little sign of improvement.
p317/p317_410|What's wrong with that?
p317/p317_162|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p317/p317_299|Some reports said they had been killed.
p317/p317_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p317/p317_350|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p317/p317_108|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p317/p317_107|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p317/p317_156|I won't make an official complaint.
p317/p317_273|We are committed to urgent action.
p317/p317_354|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p317/p317_187|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p317/p317_232|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p317/p317_318|In fact, it might just be beginning.
p317/p317_025|They have the cash to do that.
p317/p317_033|But don't expect an easy ride.
p317/p317_323|We are expected to do better than before.
p317/p317_400|It's a very special unit.
p317/p317_353|It just came into my head that day.
p317/p317_165|There was an e-mail.
p317/p317_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p317/p317_275|I am totally surprised.
p317/p317_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p317/p317_119|I was in the train station overnight.
p317/p317_128|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p317/p317_138|The captaincy will help that, too.
p317/p317_026|There was a fine line to tread.
p317/p317_131|Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
p317/p317_144|They never looked like winning it either.
p317/p317_336|She was charged with perjury.
p317/p317_163|I am totally devoted to this job.
p317/p317_405|And our game is about going forward.
p317/p317_314|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p317/p317_327|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p317/p317_306|I got on very well with Allan.
p317/p317_319|So he is open to ideas.
p317/p317_420|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p317/p317_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p317/p317_212|It's a production company.
p317/p317_087|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p317/p317_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p317/p317_095|However, it is much bigger than that.
p317/p317_130|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p317/p317_324|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p317/p317_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p317/p317_035|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p317/p317_383|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p317/p317_259|We have great confidence in Derek.
p317/p317_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p317/p317_067|Wagner was never like this.
p317/p317_388|And he is immensely loyal.
p317/p317_036|It was a policy they were against.
p317/p317_105|His handling raises a wider issue.
p317/p317_237|My life is a mess.
p317/p317_308|This is a dream come true for me.
p317/p317_218|We were a load of rubbish.
p317/p317_231|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p317/p317_223|He is at war with his knee.
p317/p317_101|This championship is different from the other majors.
p317/p317_196|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p317/p317_339|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p317/p317_294|It got no better.
p317/p317_276|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p317/p317_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p317/p317_335|It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
p317/p317_289|It's so creative and different.
p317/p317_343|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p317/p317_146|No details of the talks were given.
p317/p317_322|There is no right to appeal.
p317/p317_065|They are the partner of choice for anyone.
p317/p317_246|We need to tighten up.
p317/p317_363|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p317/p317_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p317/p317_360|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p317/p317_280|It was always open for extension.
p317/p317_368|And he goes with it.
p317/p317_139|We can't have it both ways.
p317/p317_157|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p317/p317_254|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p317/p317_412|Then one night only three people turn up.
p317/p317_348|I am awaiting a reply.
p317/p317_158|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p317/p317_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p317/p317_097|Our approach will be different.
p317/p317_084|This has not, and has been neglected.
p317/p317_407|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p317/p317_283|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p317/p317_221|Other people also tried.
p317/p317_177|We've come from a long way back.
p317/p317_341|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p317/p317_401|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p317/p317_048|As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
p317/p317_027|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p317/p317_285|He also has a house in Italy.
p317/p317_180|He seemed to lose his focus.
p317/p317_164|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p317/p317_257|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p317/p317_155|It's all about money, money, money.
p317/p317_320|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p317/p317_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p317/p317_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p317/p317_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p317/p317_174|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p317/p317_297|It would then be up to the judge.
p317/p317_313|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p317/p317_372|It broke up my marriage.
p317/p317_143|MOVIE stars are public property.
p317/p317_225|I can't deny that fact.
p317/p317_188|This is not a birthday party.
p317/p317_170|It is no place for a poet.
p317/p317_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p317/p317_145|A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
p317/p317_417|The police have to act to help them.
p317/p317_359|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p317/p317_414|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p317/p317_357|The other was the tabloids.
p317/p317_056|That tells you something about them.
p317/p317_198|Three years probation is just a joke.
p317/p317_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p317/p317_409|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p317/p317_301|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p317/p317_135|It is important that vital services are maintained.
p317/p317_103|I drove the ball well.
p317/p317_121|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p317/p317_125|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p317/p317_116|Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
p317/p317_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p317/p317_284|And that is not a bad idea.
p317/p317_214|She died in middle age.
p317/p317_264|It will be an eye for an eye.
p317/p317_061|There was no basis for their arrest.
p317/p317_195|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p317/p317_093|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p317/p317_030|The council has been open and transparent.
p317/p317_046|I would think they are just behind them.
p317/p317_402|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p317/p317_373|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p317/p317_120|It's to do with context.
p317/p317_243|It's like English in its underwear.
p317/p317_077|Will we ever play together again?
p317/p317_377|And Rangers think they have problems.
p317/p317_059|I've had to take time off work today.
p317/p317_173|My daughter is an adult.
p317/p317_166|That is a lot of writing.
p317/p317_361|We want to replicate that success.
p317/p317_123|It is essential that we win the game.
p317/p317_261|We are not too surprised.
p317/p317_080|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p317/p317_272|We are asking the council to think again.
p317/p317_344|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p317/p317_381|There will be two other areas of contention.
p317/p317_106|We have got the school holidays on.
p317/p317_149|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p317/p317_370|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p317/p317_113|The company has other problems with the shells.
p317/p317_351|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p317/p317_148|It was a wilful act of violence.
p317/p317_074|We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
p317/p317_305|It could have been just a quick fix.
p317/p317_118|Players were held in equally low regard.
p317/p317_141|Who honestly expected anything else?
p317/p317_220|I haven't made the donation yet.
p317/p317_099|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p317/p317_175|They are difficult awards to decide.
p317/p317_316|I was in the zone in the morning.
p317/p317_249|Just get on with your job.
p317/p317_063|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p317/p317_109|We understand the changes in the world.
p317/p317_122|Our home is your home.
p317/p317_248|This is a huge event.
p317/p317_047|We then went to see the headmaster.
p317/p317_236|Michael, he is running!
p317/p317_303|It is like a bereavement.
p317/p317_418|She was extremely rigid.
p317/p317_215|They do the work, you know.
p317/p317_133|They too refused to come out and talk.
p317/p317_386|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p317/p317_278|The bookies have got it about right.
p317/p317_068|It is an attitude of mind.
p317/p317_060|The problem is the book.
p317/p317_171|This is excellent value for money.
p317/p317_181|I'll just do my best.
p317/p317_334|We are not doing the Today programme.
p317/p317_161|They make a selective perception process.
p317/p317_186|Aye, but who do you really support?
p317/p317_092|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p317/p317_037|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p317/p317_406|They will have to cut through the roof.
p317/p317_262|There were no new cases yesterday.
p317/p317_300|This is the start of a new campaign.
p317/p317_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p317/p317_307|That has given me great confidence.
p317/p317_213|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p317/p317_325|I am not even thinking about that.
p317/p317_396|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p317/p317_309|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p317/p317_160|How can you not react?
p317/p317_233|I don't care to recall it.
p317/p317_364|I am very happy to be here.
p317/p317_253|They just made me feel dizzy.
p317/p317_172|Each day is a new beginning.
p317/p317_049|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p317/p317_159|She is a double victim.
p317/p317_415|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p317/p317_362|We were lucky to have survived.
p317/p317_421|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
p317/p317_281|I think we're very different.
p317/p317_081|I'm so proud of my team.
p317/p317_057|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p317/p317_066|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p317/p317_394|The committees are due to report next year.
p317/p317_298|Was all this really just five months ago?
p317/p317_389|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p317/p317_367|That meant the search was unlawful.
p317/p317_211|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p317/p317_032|The country is in a state of chaos.
p317/p317_075|It's that sort of night.
p317/p317_267|I have spoken to head office.
p317/p317_029|I am not a fan of stoppages.
p317/p317_269|Do you want a cup of tea.
p317/p317_098|Too much has already been said.
p317/p317_374|The minister is the engineer.
p317/p317_207|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p317/p317_247|I saw it at a ruck.
p317/p317_088|We will see how he is after treatment.
p317/p317_151|The driver escaped injury.
p317/p317_062|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p317/p317_058|I am a drug addict.
p317/p317_104|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p317/p317_190|It's a drop in the bucket.
p317/p317_321|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p317/p317_224|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p317/p317_124|There was no confusion over the second.
p317/p317_189|This makes no sense!
p317/p317_197|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p317/p317_040|The gaffer was great.
p317/p317_096|One season, they might do well.
p317/p317_140|Actors stand still in the frame.
p317/p317_393|She kept him on a string.
p317/p317_137|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p317/p317_358|They should be swept away.
p317/p317_117|We must get the three points.
p317/p317_390|They think that it matters but it doesn't.
p317/p317_317|He urged people to forgive.
p317/p317_205|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p317/p317_199|That's how she wants to remember him.
p317/p317_252|You are not going in blind.
p317/p317_064|They say he wants to go to England.
p317/p317_315|They didn't have a care in the world.
p317/p317_079|I played well but missed a few chances.
p317/p317_288|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p317/p317_338|The sleeper was six hours late.
p317/p317_302|The failings are serious.
p317/p317_332|The effect was almost magical.
p317/p317_085|McNaughton was not so sure.
p317/p317_183|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p317/p317_073|This is not the most crucial issue.
p317/p317_115|He had done his homework properly.
p317/p317_366|We could easily be cut again.
p317/p317_242|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p317/p317_240|For example they could be in school uniform.
p317/p317_129|You would be wrong.
p317/p317_245|I now know that from memory.
p317/p317_239|You must be ready to play anyone.
p317/p317_244|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p317/p317_391|This looks like it is anything but open.
p317/p317_349|There was no need for such a hostel.
p317/p317_227|It's unsafe for society.
p317/p317_142|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p317/p317_263|If only the problems concerned the players.
p317/p317_208|Would he be able to live with that?
p317/p317_042|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p317/p317_086|What did you learn in school today?
p317/p317_311|He was lying face down in the water.
p317/p317_204|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p317/p317_251|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p317/p317_379|It's a hidden problem.
p317/p317_043|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p317/p317_265|Whatever happened to that one?
p317/p317_238|He did not report it.
p317/p317_110|It is a potential factor.
p317/p317_226|Clubs can only do so much.
p317/p317_330|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p317/p317_346|A decision is expected next March.
p317/p317_112|That just wasn't good enough.
p317/p317_241|Surely the panel was interested?
p317/p317_076|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p317/p317_380|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p317/p317_167|I try to be open to experience.
p317/p317_228|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p317/p317_352|There's no doubt about it.
p317/p317_277|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p317/p317_136|These services may also have to be cut.
p317/p317_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p317/p317_404|It's only tackling congestion.
p317/p317_337|I was not a joiner.
p317/p317_382|I lost a part of me.
p317/p317_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p317/p317_209|However, what is his calibre?
p317/p317_398|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p317/p317_260|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p317/p317_193|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p317/p317_216|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p317/p317_053|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p317/p317_044|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p317/p317_102|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p317/p317_194|That option cannot be ruled out.
p317/p317_090|There is no signature on this document.
p317/p317_217|We are in the hat.
p317/p317_292|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p317/p317_052|Are we going to stay up?
p317/p317_132|I think it is wide open.
p317/p317_279|There's not much money in cycling.
p317/p317_328|It is good for their eyesight.
p317/p317_397|What's the theme?
p317/p317_408|That's the law of the land.
p317/p317_222|But Harry has become a franchise.
p317/p317_178|A lot of things can go wrong.
p317/p317_356|We're not an employment agency.
p317/p317_078|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p317/p317_179|I was delighted with Robbie.
p317/p317_200|How do you respond to losing your child?
p317/p317_274|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p317/p317_293|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p317/p317_258|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p317/p317_291|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p317/p317_134|We took the chances when they came.
p317/p317_219|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p317/p317_329|I feel it is very irrational.
p317/p317_255|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p317/p317_290|They are in care for a reason.
p317/p317_416|This was not the show for me.
p317/p317_051|These men are a part of India.
p317/p317_039|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p317/p317_250|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p317/p317_310|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p317/p317_028|It is so elusive and light.
p317/p317_268|Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
p317/p317_312|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p317/p317_111|This is the big one.
p317/p317_203|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p317/p317_385|But he has strong links to Labour.
p317/p317_045|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p317/p317_387|I never thought it would take this long.
p317/p317_185|The group would never be the same again.
p317/p317_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p317/p317_182|Three penalties were given.
p317/p317_392|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p317/p317_229|It would have very little impact on them.
p317/p317_375|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p317/p317_271|We have all been shocked by her death.
p317/p317_423|Manchester United are the classic example.
p317/p317_152|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p317/p317_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p317/p317_050|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p317/p317_089|This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
p317/p317_091|We could not compete with Rangers.
p317/p317_266|There were no proposals on the table.
p317/p317_282|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p317/p317_069|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p317/p317_295|I keep my fingers crossed.
p317/p317_201|Who is the employer?
p317/p317_150|We never got off the bus.
p317/p317_001|Please call Stella.
p317/p317_378|We talk to each other about these matters.
p317/p317_210|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p317/p317_365|He would help me with the form.
p317/p317_072|This is not an optional extra.
p317/p317_153|They should be looking at his victims.
p317/p317_054|I am going home to see my children.
p317/p317_126|A decision is expected shortly.
p317/p317_176|Thereafter he left Scotland.
p317/p317_395|It's a long-term solution.
p317/p317_230|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p317/p317_168|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p317/p317_347|We don't believe anything anymore.
p317/p317_270|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p317/p317_342|They were average apart, together superb.
p317/p317_234|That's the whole idea.
p307/p307_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p307/p307_062|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p307/p307_047|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p307/p307_347|I just want to change my life.
p307/p307_142|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p307/p307_416|So now this series has had its day.
p307/p307_219|What are you not good at?
p307/p307_166|However, who could have predicted this result?
p307/p307_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p307/p307_422|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p307/p307_041|It doesn't make them evil.
p307/p307_116|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p307/p307_255|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p307/p307_189|The role was perfect for Russell.
p307/p307_274|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p307/p307_082|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p307/p307_392|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p307/p307_330|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p307/p307_246|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p307/p307_110|People want to see me on the screen.
p307/p307_254|The final stage is paranoia.
p307/p307_094|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p307/p307_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p307/p307_405|Whether this return was too soon.
p307/p307_112|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p307/p307_297|They are the innocent victims.
p307/p307_363|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p307/p307_323|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p307/p307_195|Harold is a rarity.
p307/p307_281|This will secure the future of our industry.
p307/p307_262|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p307/p307_411|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p307/p307_243|His son is a local legend.
p307/p307_097|He was married with a young child.
p307/p307_278|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p307/p307_318|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p307/p307_339|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p307/p307_190|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p307/p307_307|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p307/p307_155|I was loving that little girl.
p307/p307_065|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p307/p307_265|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p307/p307_217|They were later discharged from hospital.
p307/p307_096|We did not even get a free kick.
p307/p307_371|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p307/p307_238|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p307/p307_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p307/p307_289|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p307/p307_158|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p307/p307_176|That will be the sweetness.
p307/p307_304|They tried to give her advice.
p307/p307_083|Cars are great for going long distances.
p307/p307_091|People love to see this stuff.
p307/p307_129|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p307/p307_393|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p307/p307_095|I have no plans to change the oath.
p307/p307_367|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p307/p307_157|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p307/p307_407|My thoughts are with their families.
p307/p307_045|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p307/p307_039|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p307/p307_390|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p307/p307_227|The team this year is going places.
p307/p307_349|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p307/p307_419|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p307/p307_053|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p307/p307_315|We are ready for the long haul.
p307/p307_100|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p307/p307_207|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p307/p307_420|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p307/p307_178|The big issue for us is the review.
p307/p307_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p307/p307_106|I think my game is suited to grass.
p307/p307_270|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p307/p307_260|That's the sort of game you want.
p307/p307_154|It is good for their eyesight.
p307/p307_093|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p307/p307_338|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p307/p307_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p307/p307_412|But who gets on the tube?
p307/p307_111|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p307/p307_182|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p307/p307_056|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p307/p307_208|We have no choice but to shut down.
p307/p307_325|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p307/p307_098|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p307/p307_051|It was, however, the wrong side.
p307/p307_151|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p307/p307_308|They will have to make changes.
p307/p307_396|It was early morning.
p307/p307_239|These guys will not lie down.
p307/p307_235|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p307/p307_196|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p307/p307_184|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p307/p307_102|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p307/p307_061|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p307/p307_295|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p307/p307_183|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p307/p307_171|The problem arises because he does so much.
p307/p307_140|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p307/p307_316|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p307/p307_378|There is no openness.
p307/p307_408|I saw some good things.
p307/p307_373|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p307/p307_067|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p307/p307_242|There are nine people here now.
p307/p307_350|And Michael was just great.
p307/p307_216|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p307/p307_272|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p307/p307_179|There was a fossil on screen.
p307/p307_398|What other retailer would do this?
p307/p307_236|I came up through the ranks.
p307/p307_085|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p307/p307_218|These findings would be made public.
p307/p307_141|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p307/p307_230|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p307/p307_225|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p307/p307_133|Both were later released after a check-up.
p307/p307_203|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p307/p307_267|I do not own the vessel in question.
p307/p307_287|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p307/p307_032|The punishment was swift.
p307/p307_101|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p307/p307_414|Now you see him, now you don't.
p307/p307_198|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p307/p307_143|All things are possible if you believe.
p307/p307_146|You hope he prevails.
p307/p307_156|But you can't have it both ways.
p307/p307_252|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p307/p307_359|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p307/p307_092|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p307/p307_241|That is nearly four people every day.
p307/p307_386|We were short of athletes.
p307/p307_413|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p307/p307_311|Both sides have to step back.
p307/p307_159|The death toll included five children.
p307/p307_288|They had been together for about three years.
p307/p307_210|They always want to give a performance.
p307/p307_044|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p307/p307_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p307/p307_280|That nation is South Africa.
p307/p307_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p307/p307_354|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p307/p307_087|It has never been worthwhile.
p307/p307_257|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p307/p307_353|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p307/p307_303|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p307/p307_084|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p307/p307_335|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p307/p307_200|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p307/p307_205|He will emerge as a world leader.
p307/p307_261|We're not travel agents.
p307/p307_302|Broke the birdie record.
p307/p307_187|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p307/p307_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p307/p307_403|There was no cohesion.
p307/p307_370|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p307/p307_153|He was forced to quit.
p307/p307_105|Is your life a little too easy?
p307/p307_417|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p307/p307_294|Do you come from Moscow?
p307/p307_181|This does not create any precedent.
p307/p307_334|There is no answer to it.
p307/p307_317|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p307/p307_268|Racism has no place in any sport.
p307/p307_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p307/p307_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p307/p307_173|Our young people are leaving.
p307/p307_387|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p307/p307_382|Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
p307/p307_038|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p307/p307_167|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p307/p307_360|I am not among its admirers.
p307/p307_251|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p307/p307_286|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p307/p307_057|I keep my fingers crossed.
p307/p307_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p307/p307_357|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p307/p307_228|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p307/p307_077|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p307/p307_037|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p307/p307_081|He came in an army uniform.
p307/p307_250|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p307/p307_298|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p307/p307_027|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p307/p307_201|Well, what do you know?
p307/p307_139|I'm very puzzled by it.
p307/p307_229|It took more than two years.
p307/p307_395|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p307/p307_259|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p307/p307_248|This is the New Edinburgh.
p307/p307_161|There is no credible official announcement.
p307/p307_214|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p307/p307_365|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p307/p307_172|The answer is mayhem.
p307/p307_119|It is not great art.
p307/p307_191|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p307/p307_162|I understand the medical concerns.
p307/p307_327|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p307/p307_384|It looks like paradise.
p307/p307_237|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p307/p307_344|We were lucky to have survived.
p307/p307_296|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p307/p307_331|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p307/p307_224|It had a gigantic effect.
p307/p307_107|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p307/p307_123|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p307/p307_374|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p307/p307_121|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p307/p307_001|Please call Stella.
p307/p307_120|You do not change overnight.
p307/p307_320|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p307/p307_074|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p307/p307_025|But it was a great decision he joked.
p307/p307_086|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p307/p307_058|The encounter was to change his life.
p307/p307_332|I am not obsessed with sex.
p307/p307_391|I had no qualms about it.
p307/p307_068|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p307/p307_109|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p307/p307_169|They were behind the wheel.
p307/p307_073|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p307/p307_046|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p307/p307_336|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p307/p307_028|The law has got to be upheld.
p307/p307_192|That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
p307/p307_103|I am very sorry to be here.
p307/p307_149|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p307/p307_310|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p307/p307_352|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p307/p307_348|He did not oppose the divorce.
p307/p307_213|I would not want to be young again.
p307/p307_165|I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
p307/p307_247|He would just say it was terrible.
p307/p307_076|This is a mental challenge.
p307/p307_147|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p307/p307_322|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p307/p307_050|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p307/p307_368|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p307/p307_034|I kept my side of the bargain.
p307/p307_125|We aim to put them out of business.
p307/p307_376|The home was now under new management.
p307/p307_131|She died in hospital two hours later.
p307/p307_314|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p307/p307_066|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p307/p307_256|Wanger was never like this.
p307/p307_122|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p307/p307_194|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p307/p307_362|He will address the nation this evening.
p307/p307_197|I want him to take on Gomez.
p307/p307_389|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p307/p307_233|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p307/p307_063|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p307/p307_358|We must not go down that road.
p307/p307_244|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p307/p307_043|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p307/p307_400|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p307/p307_152|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p307/p307_202|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p307/p307_060|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p307/p307_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p307/p307_424|Nobody else was with me.
p307/p307_346|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p307/p307_283|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p307/p307_042|I have played really well all year.
p307/p307_345|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p307/p307_206|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p307/p307_319|EMI is a prime example.
p307/p307_170|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p307/p307_193|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p307/p307_356|We are now setting about finding them.
p307/p307_177|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p307/p307_136|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p307/p307_266|It was a moment of madness.
p307/p307_293|We just want to get stuck in now.
p307/p307_078|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p307/p307_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p307/p307_223|I go home only once.
p307/p307_388|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p307/p307_341|I am not putting myself down.
p307/p307_355|That only came out during a radio interview.
p307/p307_364|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p307/p307_404|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p307/p307_300|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p307/p307_104|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p307/p307_245|Which perhaps is just as well.
p307/p307_031|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p307/p307_231|He said because people had invited him.
p307/p307_072|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p307/p307_175|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p307/p307_029|But we're not the same person.
p307/p307_164|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p307/p307_273|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p307/p307_277|Little Voice is on general release.
p307/p307_090|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p307/p307_127|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p307/p307_212|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p307/p307_160|Before the game we went for a pint.
p307/p307_399|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p307/p307_394|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p307/p307_313|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p307/p307_070|When he took over it really took off.
p307/p307_380|It was a job he loved.
p307/p307_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p307/p307_361|And that match was played in June.
p307/p307_292|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p307/p307_397|Partition is not an option.
p307/p307_215|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p307/p307_299|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p307/p307_258|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p307/p307_285|It was an empowering journey.
p307/p307_163|This is a United Kingdom.
p307/p307_211|But he just carried on anyway.
p307/p307_135|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p307/p307_145|It is patently true.
p307/p307_324|A friendship that will endure.
p307/p307_049|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p307/p307_069|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p307/p307_071|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p307/p307_401|I won't go back to Holland.
p307/p307_276|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p307/p307_421|His views are hardly surprising.
p307/p307_128|He was just awesome.
p307/p307_209|The prognosis is excellent.
p307/p307_321|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p307/p307_040|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p307/p307_180|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p307/p307_406|Jackson may well be right.
p307/p307_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p307/p307_199|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p307/p307_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p307/p307_379|It's being very carefully looked at.
p307/p307_269|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p307/p307_055|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p307/p307_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p307/p307_185|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p307/p307_115|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p307/p307_220|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p307/p307_088|So other options had to be explored.
p307/p307_249|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p307/p307_222|This makes no sense!
p307/p307_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p307/p307_423|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p307/p307_328|He is young but not too young.
p307/p307_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p307/p307_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p307/p307_113|The conversion didn't go over either.
p307/p307_264|It's the same old story.
p307/p307_221|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p307/p307_079|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p307/p307_059|It's the best of both worlds.
p307/p307_075|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p307/p307_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p307/p307_174|What, then, is the real thing?
p307/p307_126|Tony Blair should get out more.
p307/p307_117|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p307/p307_375|He has changed my life for ever.
p307/p307_108|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p307/p307_337|His English counterpart agreed.
p307/p307_383|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p307/p307_033|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p307/p307_340|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p307/p307_150|But it looks good for next year.
p307/p307_036|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p307/p307_253|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p307/p307_402|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p307/p307_333|They've been at it for five hours.
p307/p307_291|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p307/p307_130|We need to move forward together.
p307/p307_099|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p307/p307_186|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p307/p307_089|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p307/p307_064|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p307/p307_144|This was not just incongruous.
p307/p307_410|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p307/p307_030|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p307/p307_372|His job was not advertised.
p307/p307_282|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p307/p307_234|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p307/p307_134|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p307/p307_309|This fact is supported by audience research.
p307/p307_148|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p307/p307_301|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p307/p307_052|She is now planning a visit.
p307/p307_351|He knew it would cost him millions.
p307/p307_306|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p307/p307_342|He's a joy to follow.
p307/p307_138|The son has autism and other problems.
p307/p307_114|He took away my childhood.
p307/p307_326|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p307/p307_290|Everything has been destroyed.
p307/p307_271|Bombing is the easy option.
p307/p307_279|There is no substitute.
p307/p307_418|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p307/p307_329|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p307/p307_048|I try not to expect anything.
p307/p307_080|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p307/p307_284|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p307/p307_232|That's the key issue isn't it?
p307/p307_204|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p307/p307_305|That it is a brand name.
p307/p307_377|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p307/p307_240|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p307/p307_035|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p307/p307_137|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p307/p307_263|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p307/p307_054|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p307/p307_118|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p307/p307_026|They changed the world of music.
p307/p307_381|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p307/p307_188|I hope you miss the cut.
p307/p307_132|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p307/p307_275|I'd say we should give it a week.
p307/p307_369|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p307/p307_168|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p307/p307_124|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p307/p307_366|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p307/p307_343|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p307/p307_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p307/p307_312|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p364/p364_084|I was close enough.
p364/p364_211|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
p364/p364_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p364/p364_237|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p364/p364_201|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p364/p364_066|He leaves a beat.
p364/p364_269|Or so we thought.
p364/p364_168|One-third of the places are already taken.
p364/p364_261|It does not take much.
p364/p364_198|You would be wrong.
p364/p364_241|That is our business.
p364/p364_193|I would say the risk is very small.
p364/p364_299|You will be very, very welcome.
p364/p364_116|It's an old story.
p364/p364_252|It was a nightmare.
p364/p364_119|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
p364/p364_049|But it didn't happen.
p364/p364_149|It's a good story.
p364/p364_276|It goes in cycles.
p364/p364_031|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
p364/p364_164|I don't want to use the term.
p364/p364_165|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
p364/p364_191|The principle is quite clear.
p364/p364_274|We are keen to have him back.
p364/p364_166|Now they have to do something about it.
p364/p364_128|This time, it was not be.
p364/p364_205|It is so beautiful.
p364/p364_151|It was too soon.
p364/p364_233|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
p364/p364_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p364/p364_270|For many, it had become a fact of life.
p364/p364_213|I am happy to be here.
p364/p364_275|Horses have some sense.
p364/p364_253|But this is just the first step.
p364/p364_214|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
p364/p364_266|This could be the case.
p364/p364_263|I've seen it work already.
p364/p364_133|He will be fine.
p364/p364_282|It would be dangerous to resign.
p364/p364_264|Do you mean today?
p364/p364_062|You make the choice.
p364/p364_199|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
p364/p364_092|But this has already been rejected.
p364/p364_039|I was not fit enough and it showed.
p364/p364_262|It would be a bonus for this game.
p364/p364_057|Partly, it is his own fault.
p364/p364_309|We're talking to him.
p364/p364_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p364/p364_157|He deserved that much.
p364/p364_124|What can you say?
p364/p364_224|This one would have been.
p364/p364_169|I hope that doesn't happen.
p364/p364_032|It is not a matter of concern.
p364/p364_208|I am really, really happy.
p364/p364_249|He deserves a top team.
p364/p364_029|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p364/p364_292|I was the willing journeyman.
p364/p364_086|I said How much?
p364/p364_239|It was a long time coming.
p364/p364_243|The car driver was not injured.
p364/p364_188|We are at war.
p364/p364_160|He has gone back to school.
p364/p364_285|I certainly hope so.
p364/p364_027|That would be a big step forward.
p364/p364_122|This decision is a victory for common sense.
p364/p364_267|We try to keep it right.
p364/p364_138|It's not their fault.
p364/p364_302|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p364/p364_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p364/p364_235|They were assured that it would.
p364/p364_301|Is he any good?
p364/p364_074|This was a massive result for us.
p364/p364_072|There is no hiding place.
p364/p364_087|I support the stand that they are making.
p364/p364_037|It isn't a free-for-all.
p364/p364_207|In many ways it was disastrous.
p364/p364_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p364/p364_161|It is not illegal.
p364/p364_144|I don't entirely buy that.
p364/p364_287|It does and it doesn't.
p364/p364_143|It is sponsored by The Herald.
p364/p364_206|It is suitable and sensible.
p364/p364_227|This is very good news.
p364/p364_283|It is a victory to that extent.
p364/p364_028|I love you so very much.
p364/p364_308|They were very responsive.
p364/p364_305|I chose the former.
p364/p364_034|The man has already had too many chances.
p364/p364_048|The trial will open today.
p364/p364_113|It was just great.
p364/p364_158|We want to know about the policy.
p364/p364_290|I have been here for only three months.
p364/p364_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p364/p364_082|No-one has spoken to me.
p364/p364_153|I don't think it is the case.
p364/p364_182|We will see how he is.
p364/p364_216|It's better to be happy.
p364/p364_170|It's all happening at a local level.
p364/p364_284|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p364/p364_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p364/p364_109|Success in Scotland is important.
p364/p364_273|It's great fun to get to act.
p364/p364_162|I don't know where it went.
p364/p364_103|Our legal advice is clear.
p364/p364_294|When he got up he was hit again.
p364/p364_246|I believe in having difficult times.
p364/p364_065|It's not going to work.
p364/p364_105|This is a horrible loss.
p364/p364_150|Do not listen to them.
p364/p364_076|You see - this business is a good one.
p364/p364_297|It was just one man.
p364/p364_115|We don't know what is happening to them.
p364/p364_181|It's part of your life.
p364/p364_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p364/p364_033|We're not either of those things.
p364/p364_025|Is that not pathetic?
p364/p364_040|I thought it was the only way out.
p364/p364_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p364/p364_108|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p364/p364_058|That's where it all started.
p364/p364_197|The hearing continues today.
p364/p364_131|That's why he is a national treasure.
p364/p364_254|We can do it.
p364/p364_117|It was an important part of the course.
p364/p364_126|The money all appears to be gone.
p364/p364_298|It's going to be tough.
p364/p364_280|We have to get on with it.
p364/p364_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p364/p364_217|It's happened, but it's a dream.
p364/p364_260|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p364/p364_050|What do you think they said?
p364/p364_223|It would also delay the Scottish results.
p364/p364_055|The president took offence.
p364/p364_148|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p364/p364_240|It had happened to him.
p364/p364_159|Mr Blair defended his wife.
p364/p364_099|He liked to talk.
p364/p364_064|I knew the script.
p364/p364_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p364/p364_187|The matter has been reported to the police.
p364/p364_098|This is a one-off.
p364/p364_061|No-one knows the numbers.
p364/p364_176|I learned that only yesterday.
p364/p364_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p364/p364_155|It has paid off.
p364/p364_196|I put the drawing down.
p364/p364_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p364/p364_085|He dismissed the action.
p364/p364_152|It is an absolute disgrace.
p364/p364_183|He had a horror.
p364/p364_134|I love a clever reader.
p364/p364_194|And there are different perspectives.
p364/p364_070|They've got more time.
p364/p364_083|His arrival could be the making of them.
p364/p364_218|I had a son.
p364/p364_204|It requires a wider team.
p364/p364_067|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p364/p364_081|That would be a big mistake.
p364/p364_185|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p364/p364_190|The state is controlled by the left.
p364/p364_135|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p364/p364_163|There was nothing anyone could do.
p364/p364_145|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
p364/p364_045|And that's the trouble with this business.
p364/p364_078|Scotland were on Saturday.
p364/p364_231|I could not believe the results.
p364/p364_255|This is as bad as it gets.
p364/p364_140|It won the match.
p364/p364_251|It was really surprising.
p364/p364_077|Who is he?
p364/p364_095|It was good to score the goal today.
p364/p364_265|Israeli forces denied the claim.
p364/p364_225|We just have to improve.
p364/p364_154|Everyone would have been happy.
p364/p364_192|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
p364/p364_071|They made a huge impression on me.
p364/p364_281|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
p364/p364_203|I've got nothing to say.
p364/p364_051|There will be no disruption in the schools.
p364/p364_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p364/p364_180|Our children are our future.
p364/p364_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p364/p364_242|We were completely outplayed.
p364/p364_026|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p364/p364_096|Allison is not convinced.
p364/p364_291|We have no knowledge of this.
p364/p364_060|Why has it taken so long?
p364/p364_147|I would say so.
p364/p364_110|We could do a lot worse.
p364/p364_036|It was very moving, actually.
p364/p364_184|So it was in politics.
p364/p364_175|I'm delighted for the lads.
p364/p364_247|Stand by for action.
p364/p364_173|England will be under a lot of pressure.
p364/p364_156|Ferguson had done his homework.
p364/p364_279|He made no comment.
p364/p364_059|The family is so happy for him.
p364/p364_132|He just attracted people.
p364/p364_044|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p364/p364_030|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
p364/p364_120|Who will take them after that?
p364/p364_137|Destruction came from within.
p364/p364_268|I have got to keep the lid on.
p364/p364_127|He was extremely ill.
p364/p364_114|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p364/p364_220|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p364/p364_123|One is too many.
p364/p364_001|Please call Stella.
p364/p364_075|It's not in my nature.
p364/p364_125|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p364/p364_094|They have not seen her for years.
p364/p364_215|I believe it would have been successful.
p364/p364_228|Is it a warning to parents?
p364/p364_130|The timing is wrong.
p364/p364_272|It was a definite penalty.
p364/p364_046|So what did he do?
p364/p364_063|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
p364/p364_136|But he's a very quiet man.
p364/p364_054|There is no doubt about that.
p364/p364_209|This is perfectly legal.
p364/p364_289|We suspect he was pleased.
p364/p364_097|He felt there was no case to answer.
p364/p364_300|I really want to win in Glasgow.
p364/p364_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p364/p364_259|That's the last thing he will do.
p364/p364_286|She died later on Monday.
p364/p364_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p364/p364_043|The concept is simple.
p364/p364_222|What do you do.
p364/p364_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p364/p364_238|We just do not do it.
p364/p364_236|Thankfully they liked it.
p364/p364_304|This was repeated the second time.
p364/p364_100|Lots of others were doing the same.
p364/p364_047|We must not give in to bastards.
p364/p364_210|I'm not interested in money.
p364/p364_079|He wanted to talk to me about it.
p364/p364_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p364/p364_106|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p364/p364_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p364/p364_129|They are unable to say anything.
p364/p364_189|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
p364/p364_146|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p364/p364_303|It was then that Rangers scored.
p364/p364_277|And now he has decided, enough.
p364/p364_102|This takes the pressure off.
p364/p364_172|We must do that.
p364/p364_195|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
p364/p364_111|I know the worry over Iraq.
p364/p364_091|I didn't have the choice.
p364/p364_200|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p364/p364_101|It is still holding good today.
p364/p364_035|It shouldn't be a problem.
p364/p364_089|But was it really so big?
p364/p364_256|The real issue is personal.
p364/p364_257|That can happen so easily.
p364/p364_073|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p364/p364_179|But he did not rule out further talks.
p364/p364_234|It was all over for us then.
p364/p364_177|It's very very frustrating.
p364/p364_219|It was very, very frightening.
p364/p364_038|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
p364/p364_245|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p364/p364_053|I can live with that.
p364/p364_167|The post will be unpaid.
p364/p364_178|We want him to continue that way.
p364/p364_221|I had no choice.
p364/p364_293|I know we ask a lot of you.
p364/p364_226|It hasn't worked out that way.
p364/p364_244|It was a surprising decision.
p364/p364_069|It lasted longer than we thought.
p364/p364_232|What do you do?
p364/p364_230|There is nothing wrong with that.
p364/p364_042|Since then it has become a tradition.
p364/p364_118|It has been a great success.
p364/p364_068|I see no need to change.
p364/p364_278|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
p364/p364_104|But he has a lifeline.
p364/p364_202|The attitude was good today.
p364/p364_174|This has been fantastic.
p364/p364_171|You will never replace the child.
p364/p364_248|It was something special.
p364/p364_041|We welcome the ministers decision.
p364/p364_107|We are not leaving the area.
p364/p364_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p364/p364_141|New investment will be openly tendered.
p364/p364_306|Sub Not Used, McKee.
p364/p364_088|The couple had one daughter.
p364/p364_271|Last season was very hard for me.
p364/p364_121|It is part of their job.
p364/p364_090|Nature will not find its own level.
p364/p364_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p364/p364_212|I can handle the pace.
p364/p364_142|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
p364/p364_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p364/p364_250|We just need the Government to act.
p364/p364_229|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p364/p364_112|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p364/p364_288|It will not be today, though.
p364/p364_056|Our commitment is to move forward.
p364/p364_258|We deserved to get the victory today.
p299/p299_404|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p299/p299_283|Some of the players have not progressed.
p299/p299_368|Horses have some sense.
p299/p299_336|The package has been properly costed.
p299/p299_146|There is too much at stake for that.
p299/p299_120|You can see their point.
p299/p299_032|It's easy to see why.
p299/p299_365|I don't have a new house.
p299/p299_256|We don't have the credible evidence.
p299/p299_044|Today is not about contracts.
p299/p299_081|You can't keep them separate.
p299/p299_033|I am proud of moments like that.
p299/p299_126|There were no casualties.
p299/p299_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p299/p299_199|I'm not afraid of that.
p299/p299_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p299/p299_317|I've seen some of the submissions.
p299/p299_180|It's not in my nature.
p299/p299_362|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p299/p299_153|Most of the public are behind me.
p299/p299_088|A decision is expected today.
p299/p299_097|He is a man who lives to work.
p299/p299_043|I've learned from my mistakes.
p299/p299_048|It's to do with play.
p299/p299_135|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p299/p299_230|I believe you may be that person.
p299/p299_244|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p299/p299_145|This has a number of benefits.
p299/p299_381|I'm getting back up there now.
p299/p299_070|They had had time for little else.
p299/p299_208|I'm a bit annoyed.
p299/p299_098|The website is now being amended.
p299/p299_151|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p299/p299_114|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p299/p299_311|We are in a learning curve.
p299/p299_171|Was it a foul?
p299/p299_385|We suspect he was pleased.
p299/p299_141|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p299/p299_069|They have got off with murder.
p299/p299_168|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p299/p299_304|What went wrong?
p299/p299_257|It's one up to the Scots.
p299/p299_373|One policeman was killed.
p299/p299_394|If there is default.
p299/p299_034|This is a totally different order of agreement.
p299/p299_113|He had other things on his mind.
p299/p299_067|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p299/p299_214|Here are some possible solutions.
p299/p299_289|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p299/p299_107|I am a wealthy person.
p299/p299_144|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p299/p299_250|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p299/p299_104|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p299/p299_099|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p299/p299_178|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p299/p299_129|The case will now go to appeal.
p299/p299_025|I just went for it over the weekend.
p299/p299_201|She told me to apply for the crest.
p299/p299_186|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p299/p299_324|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p299/p299_132|Where is the anthrax?
p299/p299_360|The place became a war zone.
p299/p299_106|That was the light relief.
p299/p299_194|Is Saddam a threat?
p299/p299_110|That, he claimed, was essential.
p299/p299_101|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p299/p299_305|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p299/p299_124|Yet he chose to do something different.
p299/p299_181|You see - this business is a good one.
p299/p299_149|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p299/p299_235|I will not be pressured.
p299/p299_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p299/p299_405|Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
p299/p299_296|There were so many characters among them.
p299/p299_299|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p299/p299_205|The actors are confident and polished.
p299/p299_301|Now there's an even bigger target.
p299/p299_092|We certainly will need to watch him.
p299/p299_037|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p299/p299_102|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p299/p299_294|It's a source of deep concern.
p299/p299_271|We do things in an appropriate way.
p299/p299_344|He will never walk the streets again.
p299/p299_122|They married in August last year.
p299/p299_303|No decision on that was taken.
p299/p299_376|We have been working together for some years.
p299/p299_150|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p299/p299_351|That's the last thing he will do.
p299/p299_143|My aim is a top six finish.
p299/p299_109|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p299/p299_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p299/p299_363|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p299/p299_329|People might not actually want the job.
p299/p299_259|He is a right bastard.
p299/p299_218|We are now up against it.
p299/p299_087|We are losing this war.
p299/p299_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p299/p299_188|It worked, up to a point.
p299/p299_401|We only lost the third goal.
p299/p299_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p299/p299_366|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p299/p299_339|Barry will be able to handle this.
p299/p299_154|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p299/p299_185|It was that bad, that low.
p299/p299_179|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p299/p299_165|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p299/p299_155|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p299/p299_191|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p299/p299_281|The whole team was rubbish.
p299/p299_078|Robert is a special talent.
p299/p299_202|He explained to his audience.
p299/p299_340|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p299/p299_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p299/p299_060|He had played well in that central role.
p299/p299_369|The plot is minimal.
p299/p299_182|Who is he?
p299/p299_061|We hope this scheme will change that.
p299/p299_091|There is a growing anger among the group.
p299/p299_210|I just could not cope.
p299/p299_227|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p299/p299_221|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p299/p299_162|They will know they deserve to be there.
p299/p299_064|How could anyone take issue with that?
p299/p299_264|So there's a double whammy.
p299/p299_139|I had a tie in my hand.
p299/p299_112|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p299/p299_383|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p299/p299_284|It is quite an eye opener.
p299/p299_396|I'll take what comes along.
p299/p299_203|I think the Government should pay for that.
p299/p299_083|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p299/p299_175|Promises were not kept.
p299/p299_298|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p299/p299_072|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p299/p299_054|I have been here for only three months.
p299/p299_242|I was the only one arguing differently.
p299/p299_053|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p299/p299_268|She is a great talent.
p299/p299_302|They were the better side on the day.
p299/p299_217|He made so many bad decisions.
p299/p299_136|The road was closed for several hours.
p299/p299_261|And we still have to pay his salary.
p299/p299_090|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p299/p299_323|He's very young but he is growing up.
p299/p299_397|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p299/p299_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p299/p299_158|But we are severely limited in funds.
p299/p299_156|I am still very much a director.
p299/p299_142|Such a city does not exist.
p299/p299_318|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p299/p299_164|This is a huge confidence boost.
p299/p299_239|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p299/p299_228|This must be really short of ideas.
p299/p299_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p299/p299_196|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p299/p299_325|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p299/p299_232|What makes a house a home?
p299/p299_398|She will just have wanted her baby.
p299/p299_315|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p299/p299_395|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p299/p299_384|There is a lot of anger.
p299/p299_233|I think however, he was having a fit!
p299/p299_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p299/p299_353|I am ready for that.
p299/p299_095|Our offer will remain on the table.
p299/p299_100|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p299/p299_206|The budget was too low for that.
p299/p299_173|We've been there for seven years.
p299/p299_314|She was just that sort of person.
p299/p299_255|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p299/p299_380|Do what you have to do.
p299/p299_279|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p299/p299_331|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p299/p299_341|We just need the Government to act.
p299/p299_330|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p299/p299_077|How can they say that?
p299/p299_051|Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
p299/p299_248|It was a tactical change.
p299/p299_361|What's happening to her?
p299/p299_354|Do you mean today?
p299/p299_059|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p299/p299_262|Also, he was flawed.
p299/p299_245|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p299/p299_160|Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
p299/p299_240|I would say so.
p299/p299_231|It was a big day.
p299/p299_309|I thought he was part of the camera.
p299/p299_287|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p299/p299_108|He has one son and one daughter.
p299/p299_357|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p299/p299_243|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p299/p299_378|He has never even been to Ireland.
p299/p299_269|I hope my successor will do the same.
p299/p299_055|Everything else is second.
p299/p299_065|He takes time out for everyone.
p299/p299_103|He had a heart problem.
p299/p299_319|It was chaotic and frightening.
p299/p299_046|That says something for his strength of character.
p299/p299_308|We're all in a state of shock.
p299/p299_291|There is a cup final at stake.
p299/p299_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p299/p299_307|This must have been severe.
p299/p299_322|Soon the whole country will be level.
p299/p299_125|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p299/p299_288|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p299/p299_321|It is a question of balance.
p299/p299_096|We are trying to establish a date.
p299/p299_313|He was released in March this year.
p299/p299_084|But there was a shift.
p299/p299_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p299/p299_063|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p299/p299_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p299/p299_276|The fans will support us.
p299/p299_204|I never made any offer to Mark.
p299/p299_172|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p299/p299_128|I was pleased with my own game.
p299/p299_377|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p299/p299_224|But the row refused to go away.
p299/p299_267|We knew nothing about it.
p299/p299_370|See it while you can.
p299/p299_316|Instead, she just went away.
p299/p299_207|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p299/p299_193|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p299/p299_387|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p299/p299_073|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p299/p299_356|But my heart is in athletics.
p299/p299_094|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p299/p299_066|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p299/p299_137|They can be time consuming.
p299/p299_040|We agreed to disagree.
p299/p299_391|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p299/p299_310|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p299/p299_195|We've got a great defensive club.
p299/p299_402|Women reported more depression than men.
p299/p299_327|We could not have asked for any more.
p299/p299_236|I had another good day.
p299/p299_273|Are you in this movie?
p299/p299_352|I have not been so angry for years.
p299/p299_116|The next few months will tell.
p299/p299_123|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p299/p299_035|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p299/p299_326|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p299/p299_089|The death rates are still as high.
p299/p299_082|I still feel like a wee boy.
p299/p299_400|We are working on the two things.
p299/p299_152|It was then into overtime.
p299/p299_028|Gilbert was not amused.
p299/p299_115|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p299/p299_121|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p299/p299_027|It is only one night, after all.
p299/p299_292|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p299/p299_001|Please call Stella.
p299/p299_312|Why should we have been asked to share?
p299/p299_189|There was no rescue.
p299/p299_209|On that they agree.
p299/p299_260|I don't want to use the term.
p299/p299_133|Bombing is the easy option.
p299/p299_337|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p299/p299_220|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p299/p299_306|They chose to side with terror.
p299/p299_272|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p299/p299_130|They really did a great job.
p299/p299_293|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p299/p299_079|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p299/p299_075|It does not stop at the border.
p299/p299_170|She is a very lucky lady.
p299/p299_343|The criminal justice system does not do that.
p299/p299_192|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p299/p299_348|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p299/p299_039|I think we have a very strong case.
p299/p299_119|I am happy with my form.
p299/p299_041|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p299/p299_215|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p299/p299_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p299/p299_275|The things writers and directors say!
p299/p299_347|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p299/p299_229|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p299/p299_371|The plane was in flames
p299/p299_050|I've just got to do this.
p299/p299_338|We will work through the night.
p299/p299_258|I'm just doing artwork.
p299/p299_159|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p299/p299_080|She added, It is a huge problem.
p299/p299_234|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p299/p299_237|I hate the word.
p299/p299_177|His signature is his handwriting.
p299/p299_118|It is crucial for both teams.
p299/p299_350|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p299/p299_345|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p299/p299_062|It was created by genocide.
p299/p299_320|I think in three dimensions.
p299/p299_270|I learned that only yesterday.
p299/p299_184|Our members are concerned about their futures.
p299/p299_161|My house was shaking at the time.
p299/p299_216|They were both very brave.
p299/p299_042|If you look at the beginning of Alien.
p299/p299_382|We believe the squad will stay together.
p299/p299_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p299/p299_375|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p299/p299_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p299/p299_226|Bill is a mentor.
p299/p299_052|That was the problem.
p299/p299_364|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p299/p299_342|The urgency is real.
p299/p299_282|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p299/p299_251|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
p299/p299_036|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p299/p299_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p299/p299_148|These matters are now behind us.
p299/p299_045|It should be a great game, though.
p299/p299_117|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p299/p299_174|He was as good as his word.
p299/p299_068|A number of people could not speak English.
p299/p299_297|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p299/p299_167|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p299/p299_223|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p299/p299_355|This is normal for him now.
p299/p299_300|The Dow Jones is way up.
p299/p299_071|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p299/p299_246|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p299/p299_197|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p299/p299_111|I have great respect for all my players.
p299/p299_030|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p299/p299_140|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p299/p299_290|Are his works inside out?
p299/p299_219|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p299/p299_349|I can't stop people thinking.
p299/p299_403|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p299/p299_047|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p299/p299_334|I am not retiring.
p299/p299_280|We need to be looking to the future.
p299/p299_198|I feel privileged to be here.
p299/p299_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p299/p299_029|My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
p299/p299_138|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p299/p299_057|Sex is fun?
p299/p299_274|We have got a full house tonight.
p299/p299_367|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p299/p299_131|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p299/p299_252|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p299/p299_134|I love you so very much.
p299/p299_200|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p299/p299_249|She had kept the news from him.
p299/p299_105|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p299/p299_212|It is all one-sided.
p299/p299_076|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p299/p299_389|Maybe, who knows?
p299/p299_388|She always wanted her own way.
p299/p299_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p299/p299_278|It was a long process, but we got there.
p299/p299_399|Scotland is losing business.
p299/p299_085|Israel has done very little until now.
p299/p299_026|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p299/p299_163|Of course he is.
p299/p299_147|That is in the very nature of farming.
p299/p299_277|Is this new report the answer?
p299/p299_031|It has moved on in the last week.
p299/p299_328|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p299/p299_222|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p299/p299_285|You've got it coming Kabul.
p299/p299_333|I have a bunch of veterans.
p299/p299_074|The settlement could run to millions.
p299/p299_386|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p299/p299_166|And does it?
p299/p299_086|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p299/p299_247|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p299/p299_295|I am not a free trader.
p299/p299_335|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p299/p299_253|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p299/p299_374|I didn't do too badly myself.
p299/p299_093|I don't think it could be clearer.
p299/p299_190|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p299/p299_263|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p299/p299_176|My life has been destroyed.
p299/p299_213|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p299/p299_359|Yet he left a few days later.
p299/p299_372|But then, that really is the point.
p299/p299_332|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p299/p299_286|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p299/p299_058|They were not doing it too well, either.
p299/p299_187|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p299/p299_056|I think it is a sensible change.
p299/p299_393|We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
p299/p299_049|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p299/p299_157|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p299/p299_358|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p299/p299_127|I've just got to build on this now.
p299/p299_225|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p299/p299_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p299/p299_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p299/p299_038|This is a big advantage.
p299/p299_254|One of these problems is the railways.
p299/p299_379|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p299/p299_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p299/p299_241|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p299/p299_211|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p299/p299_169|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p299/p299_265|I didn't have a trio.
p299/p299_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p299/p299_390|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p299/p299_238|We should be trying to keep him in.
p299/p299_392|It was a sell-out.
p299/p299_183|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p299/p299_266|Their three other children had died as infants.
p299/p299_346|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p283/p283_171|We have a clean bill of health.
p283/p283_144|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p283/p283_210|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p283/p283_079|It is very special for me.
p283/p283_122|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p283/p283_201|Does the name matter?
p283/p283_397|We came across the first set of bodies.
p283/p283_327|Is there a waiting list?
p283/p283_178|The woman was his wife.
p283/p283_173|Today I had no failures in my team.
p283/p283_206|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p283/p283_284|You can never tell with the manager.
p283/p283_203|What are you not good at?
p283/p283_332|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p283/p283_337|The songs are just so good.
p283/p283_106|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p283/p283_312|It further expressed his defiance.
p283/p283_055|I was inspired by two things.
p283/p283_186|It's never great to finish second.
p283/p283_295|We accept the new rules.
p283/p283_266|It had so much to do with output.
p283/p283_187|We have a budget in March.
p283/p283_224|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p283/p283_087|I'd like to see the business case.
p283/p283_315|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p283/p283_065|I expect a rapid response.
p283/p283_221|They are still very quiet.
p283/p283_096|Potions said he would drive.
p283/p283_343|It became a book by itself.
p283/p283_331|The attacker died in the crash.
p283/p283_154|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p283/p283_428|That is a personal matter.
p283/p283_384|Does it matter?
p283/p283_190|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p283/p283_457|I'd never run for them.
p283/p283_045|Among them are many criminals.
p283/p283_080|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p283/p283_273|Did he trip?
p283/p283_435|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p283/p283_459|He was confronted by police.
p283/p283_393|The pair are very much in love.
p283/p283_036|It is not for any other purpose.
p283/p283_218|We represent a wide range of society.
p283/p283_418|That's all I can say.
p283/p283_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p283/p283_297|They are very keen to work with us.
p283/p283_389|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p283/p283_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p283/p283_217|I will work on her.
p283/p283_082|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p283/p283_113|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p283/p283_109|And does it?
p283/p283_110|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p283/p283_089|I've had it for the exams.
p283/p283_275|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p283/p283_260|At the time, he was a living legend.
p283/p283_282|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p283/p283_228|That is the real test.
p283/p283_419|How do you take them away?
p283/p283_316|We have to be very, very careful.
p283/p283_243|I'm just a regular person.
p283/p283_307|It was an easy decision to come here.
p283/p283_037|That means an extra two years.
p283/p283_326|What are they for?
p283/p283_170|Three hours later, the man was free.
p283/p283_304|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p283/p283_439|He will be judged by his actions.
p283/p283_268|And they were being paid?
p283/p283_276|The irony was not lost.
p283/p283_030|And we have a singer.
p283/p283_074|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p283/p283_296|He looked like a schoolboy.
p283/p283_385|That can be good for us.
p283/p283_133|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p283/p283_090|You have to respect the office.
p283/p283_431|These guys are looking for business.
p283/p283_388|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p283/p283_035|It could well be the case.
p283/p283_223|I came home by ambulance.
p283/p283_160|This will secure the future of our industry.
p283/p283_420|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p283/p283_256|It could be to do with the location.
p283/p283_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p283/p283_360|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p283/p283_399|It has only been rumours.
p283/p283_105|Why do it otherwise?
p283/p283_235|This will take several weeks.
p283/p283_128|From it emerged a cup.
p283/p283_455|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p283/p283_313|He said he was sorry.
p283/p283_286|Persuaded to change his mind.
p283/p283_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p283/p283_430|My aim is a top six finish.
p283/p283_066|We felt it was sufficient.
p283/p283_058|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p283/p283_101|IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p283/p283_410|The BBC was a disgrace.
p283/p283_359|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p283/p283_269|was everything done to save people?
p283/p283_272|Is it in the right place?
p283/p283_196|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p283/p283_255|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p283/p283_440|Which may be the same thing.
p283/p283_396|This is a club on the rise.
p283/p283_060|So is that it, then?
p283/p283_356|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p283/p283_150|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p283/p283_392|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p283/p283_033|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p283/p283_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p283/p283_446|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p283/p283_112|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p283/p283_238|January is a bad time of year.
p283/p283_303|It is the end of an adventure.
p283/p283_181|The research was my life.
p283/p283_068|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p283/p283_094|It's so hard to shift.
p283/p283_200|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p283/p283_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p283/p283_252|It was a crazy day.
p283/p283_043|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p283/p283_470|City sentiment is in his favour.
p283/p283_176|He was asked to quit.
p283/p283_107|So, did she meet him?
p283/p283_288|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p283/p283_381|Had this been common practice?
p283/p283_230|The early physical reports were clear.
p283/p283_409|Colour was at the core of his life.
p283/p283_382|What do they want us to do?
p283/p283_310|My whole life has changed.
p283/p283_081|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p283/p283_227|I suggest a new plan.
p283/p283_193|There was no hint of scandal.
p283/p283_097|The trick is to try it.
p283/p283_001|Please call Stella.
p283/p283_335|I was there five months ago.
p283/p283_302|At first I thought I was gone.
p283/p283_278|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p283/p283_198|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p283/p283_069|We believe a third party was involved.
p283/p283_394|As, indeed, they would be.
p283/p283_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p283/p283_167|Why change it?
p283/p283_429|I'm pleased about one thing.
p283/p283_291|I should think so, too.
p283/p283_289|My son was too young to die.
p283/p283_347|But I think it's different from the rest!
p283/p283_292|My office is down there.
p283/p283_372|Ferguson is a good example.
p283/p283_063|He also presented You Bet!
p283/p283_104|That is the important thing.
p283/p283_205|Who was she?
p283/p283_353|And he goes with it.
p283/p283_258|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p283/p283_321|This is the correct decision.
p283/p283_067|This is the year of the Tiger.
p283/p283_367|I'd like to take the plunge.
p283/p283_213|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p283/p283_469|Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
p283/p283_442|We shall not forget him.
p283/p283_053|That was the theory, anyway.
p283/p283_248|There's a chance they might come down.
p283/p283_398|Theatre is not a museum.
p283/p283_140|If not, a deal could take many months.
p283/p283_449|If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
p283/p283_294|I told you I was ill.
p283/p283_059|How are you, sir?
p283/p283_436|It is based on a true story.
p283/p283_271|Do I think about them often?
p283/p283_165|Are you going to win?
p283/p283_139|We did what we had to do.
p283/p283_136|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p283/p283_102|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p283/p283_229|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p283/p283_414|I was shaking on the blocks.
p283/p283_277|I would do away with the dress code.
p283/p283_026|We are a service industry.
p283/p283_416|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p283/p283_120|There is no credible official announcement.
p283/p283_166|Was it the wife?
p283/p283_417|The second goal was superb.
p283/p283_083|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p283/p283_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p283/p283_124|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p283/p283_099|However, it did not end that way.
p283/p283_370|There is a range of employers.
p283/p283_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p283/p283_130|That might help a bit.
p283/p283_041|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p283/p283_333|No final decision has been taken.
p283/p283_375|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p283/p283_129|That was the first step.
p283/p283_148|He was a home referee.
p283/p283_180|They should stop the bombing.
p283/p283_225|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p283/p283_450|We went straight into the bedroom.
p283/p283_466|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p283/p283_362|In the old days, it was easy.
p283/p283_441|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p283/p283_132|We would make a start.
p283/p283_062|What do we do?
p283/p283_108|So what is the campaign about?
p283/p283_137|This should begin in October.
p283/p283_257|We played them off the pitch.
p283/p283_240|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p283/p283_075|We will pay their bills.
p283/p283_146|It's not a U-turn at all.
p283/p283_279|The minister is the engineer.
p283/p283_298|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p283/p283_462|Let that be their memorial.
p283/p283_164|What happened in that game?
p283/p283_135|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p283/p283_344|Cast Away now on general release.
p283/p283_412|But the foundations have been laid.
p283/p283_445|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p283/p283_071|There's still plenty time left.
p283/p283_172|It was by the numbers.
p283/p283_091|He has been a success this year.
p283/p283_138|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p283/p283_031|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p283/p283_390|It's as wide as a church in here.
p283/p283_029|Because we do not need it.
p283/p283_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p283/p283_086|It looks like a hit.
p283/p283_423|I was pleased with my own game.
p283/p283_299|The next month is very important.
p283/p283_438|Being with me is an honour.
p283/p283_361|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p283/p283_401|I could not live with it.
p283/p283_219|We always felt we could win.
p283/p283_169|It has to be an event.
p283/p283_197|The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p283/p283_244|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p283/p283_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p283/p283_453|I was embarrassed by it.
p283/p283_320|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p283/p283_314|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p283/p283_237|We have an election in eight days.
p283/p283_084|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p283/p283_051|It also opened a branch in Livingston.
p283/p283_366|He was at school in Devon.
p283/p283_093|We have to offer value for money.
p283/p283_054|I had come back from London.
p283/p283_182|I'd love to be like Peter.
p283/p283_152|I'm so grateful for that.
p283/p283_044|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p283/p283_342|The capital costs are modest.
p283/p283_070|The Government should be ashamed.
p283/p283_281|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p283/p283_057|There was no safety net.
p283/p283_226|You could feel the heat.
p283/p283_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p283/p283_209|She was married with one son.
p283/p283_072|You do not change overnight.
p283/p283_261|My wife and family are the support system.
p283/p283_364|The airport was even different.
p283/p283_134|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p283/p283_199|The hotel was now for sale.
p283/p283_162|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p283/p283_348|It is a matter of clarity.
p283/p283_207|They receive a high profile in the media.
p283/p283_061|Do I have a favourite?
p283/p283_116|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p283/p283_358|We will listen to any suggestion.
p283/p283_222|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p283/p283_049|No details of the talks were given.
p283/p283_147|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p283/p283_151|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p283/p283_050|Clearly, they had other problems.
p283/p283_157|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p283/p283_153|It will be retained as part of the group.
p283/p283_149|Before it was an ordeal.
p283/p283_247|These will take a little time to develop.
p283/p283_300|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p283/p283_386|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p283/p283_092|By then, he was walking on water.
p283/p283_131|It is a delight on every level.
p283/p283_239|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p283/p283_403|A review is under way.
p283/p283_100|It really was an unusual award.
p283/p283_250|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p283/p283_434|It needs to be volatile.
p283/p283_270|What was the matter for concern?
p283/p283_028|The idea is not new.
p283/p283_368|I have a moral dilemma.
p283/p283_215|It was a bit like having children.
p283/p283_117|It's for that reason he should resign.
p283/p283_328|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p283/p283_098|Little is known about them.
p283/p283_032|We speak about the performance.
p283/p283_214|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p283/p283_025|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p283/p283_363|They were impressive against France.
p283/p283_352|Another reason is a shortage of stock.
p283/p283_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p283/p283_274|That takes a lot of courage.
p283/p283_467|It all began as an accident.
p283/p283_379|He was then replaced by Ross.
p283/p283_448|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p283/p283_123|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p283/p283_447|Something has got to give.
p283/p283_402|The death rates are still as high.
p283/p283_142|Last night, the row continued.
p283/p283_078|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p283/p283_194|It was to be inclusive.
p283/p283_177|There is no reason at all.
p283/p283_301|This is a total mystery.
p283/p283_048|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p283/p283_283|Nato was not a love affair.
p283/p283_145|We are entirely happy with Russell.
p283/p283_236|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p283/p283_103|We could not get any possession.
p283/p283_287|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p283/p283_232|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p283/p283_357|We want to play at the worlds.
p283/p283_421|After the match, do you?
p283/p283_350|They come to enjoy themselves.
p283/p283_346|The party lasted all night.
p283/p283_046|I was released after six days.
p283/p283_422|I am astonished at attack.
p283/p283_308|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p283/p283_159|I was caught out a little bit.
p283/p283_391|It would be quite nice.
p283/p283_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p283/p283_220|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p283/p283_424|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p283/p283_233|This is a holy place.
p283/p283_216|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p283/p283_253|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p283/p283_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p283/p283_309|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p283/p283_406|That investment has now been secured.
p283/p283_387|But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
p283/p283_464|She has now been registered as disabled.
p283/p283_095|They lived for their children.
p283/p283_322|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p283/p283_444|Everything in golf is a balance.
p283/p283_465|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p283/p283_211|A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
p283/p283_351|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p283/p283_461|She has reached the top of her profession.
p283/p283_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p283/p283_324|What form did that take?
p283/p283_437|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p283/p283_143|You've got to be vigilant.
p283/p283_174|My Dad is a hero.
p283/p283_126|It was won on the issue of the land.
p283/p283_339|We need to increase the membership.
p283/p283_141|But it is different in different regions.
p283/p283_121|Our house was very small.
p283/p283_251|The problem was you thought you were a big man.
p283/p283_163|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p283/p283_264|She claimed the day was for young people.
p283/p283_039|He is believed to live in Britain.
p283/p283_185|He was in great spirits.
p283/p283_407|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p283/p283_373|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p283/p283_432|He is on the wrong side.
p283/p283_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p283/p283_318|If not, he should go home.
p283/p283_404|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p283/p283_249|This is an exciting time for the party.
p283/p283_427|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p283/p283_306|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p283/p283_168|What do we want to do that for?
p283/p283_175|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p283/p283_433|I would rather look at him.
p283/p283_038|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p283/p283_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p283/p283_254|Our future is in their hands.
p283/p283_191|It's nice to be nice.
p283/p283_425|Yet the data is compelling.
p283/p283_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p283/p283_040|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p283/p283_463|This morning I got a call from my wife.
p283/p283_345|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p283/p283_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p283/p283_188|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p283/p283_076|He is a young man with a new deal.
p283/p283_179|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p283/p283_088|It makes for an interesting conference.
p283/p283_114|Their attitude is all wrong.
p283/p283_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p283/p283_077|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p283/p283_336|Well, he can do it.
p283/p283_052|I would say the position is open.
p283/p283_454|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p283/p283_192|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p283/p283_317|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p283/p283_377|I said she was very young.
p283/p283_156|I am just trying to do my job.
p283/p283_319|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p283/p283_468|We are going through the process.
p283/p283_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p283/p283_290|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p283/p283_443|I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
p283/p283_246|His second was a beauty.
p283/p283_415|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p283/p283_471|It's been a long, long journey.
p283/p283_365|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p283/p283_158|It has become a way of life.
p283/p283_189|Nobody did in those days.
p283/p283_073|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p283/p283_376|It should be a great game, though.
p283/p283_119|It's been a long wait.
p283/p283_245|It was a great experience.
p283/p283_204|I think, therefore I am?
p283/p283_349|He did that every night I was with him.
p283/p283_125|Sport is good for you.
p283/p283_369|Last weekend he was awful.
p283/p283_208|They bought the property four years ago.
p283/p283_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p283/p283_115|We made a world record together.
p283/p283_202|how do you get it back?
p283/p283_374|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p283/p283_426|No date has been set for a meeting.
p283/p283_456|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p283/p283_155|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p283/p283_042|The boy is no longer with us.
p283/p283_183|The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
p283/p283_323|The Project is far from that.
p283/p283_267|She died in middle age.
p283/p283_085|The result is a vacuum.
p283/p283_330|He will address the nation this evening.
p283/p283_329|So what happens next?
p283/p283_411|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p283/p283_400|Final proposals will be published in February.
p283/p283_354|My life is exactly the same.
p283/p283_259|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p283/p283_311|It was never a free kick.
p283/p283_242|I had relied on him.
p283/p283_378|He had no previous convictions.
p283/p283_341|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p283/p283_056|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p283/p283_241|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p283/p283_118|There were no grounds for his action.
p283/p283_184|I am a good player.
p283/p283_231|Consumers have the right to choose.
p283/p283_127|I am a committed European.
p283/p283_405|There is a lack of logic.
p283/p283_212|We are not making any comment.
p283/p283_408|It proved a good decision.
p283/p283_293|None of the agencies was able to help.
p283/p283_285|We need to establish the facts.
p283/p283_195|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p283/p283_064|Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
p283/p283_413|I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
p283/p283_027|It's not going to work out that way.
p283/p283_371|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p283/p283_161|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p283/p283_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p283/p283_458|She came to the Highland Show.
p283/p283_460|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p283/p283_111|It's good to have a voice.
p283/p283_263|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p283/p283_234|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p283/p283_265|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p283/p283_262|They have not been in touch with the club.
p283/p283_305|It looks as though he will be right.
p283/p283_034|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p283/p283_338|And it's a goodbye from him.
p283/p283_334|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p283/p283_280|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p283/p283_383|Is it worth it?
p283/p283_380|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p283/p283_451|I do not see it as some kind of reward.
p283/p283_340|A new school will be built.
p283/p283_395|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p283/p283_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p277/p277_320|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p277/p277_111|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p277/p277_138|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p277/p277_268|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p277/p277_067|I feel I did not have enough time.
p277/p277_441|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p277/p277_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p277/p277_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p277/p277_429|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p277/p277_186|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p277/p277_367|It was a funny game.
p277/p277_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p277/p277_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p277/p277_335|He loves the big occasions.
p277/p277_461|I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
p277/p277_410|Feel the air, the space.
p277/p277_097|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p277/p277_089|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277/p277_439|It won the match.
p277/p277_121|The mood is upbeat.
p277/p277_449|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p277/p277_124|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p277/p277_406|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p277/p277_391|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p277/p277_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p277/p277_350|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p277/p277_361|They have not done so this season so far.
p277/p277_252|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p277/p277_382|At the last I found a bunker.
p277/p277_285|The songs are just so good.
p277/p277_077|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p277/p277_253|Blood samples were taken.
p277/p277_392|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p277/p277_133|The BBC was a disgrace.
p277/p277_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p277/p277_409|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p277/p277_266|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p277/p277_356|Four policemen were wounded.
p277/p277_249|This is the first step.
p277/p277_159|They should come clean.
p277/p277_280|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p277/p277_073|He was popular.
p277/p277_096|They lived for their children.
p277/p277_175|As we worked.
p277/p277_384|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p277/p277_104|I love the Dome.
p277/p277_125|Who would have?
p277/p277_222|However, no further action was taken by police.
p277/p277_243|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p277/p277_221|Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
p277/p277_353|There was a substantial explosion.
p277/p277_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p277/p277_213|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p277/p277_071|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p277/p277_069|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p277/p277_225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p277/p277_182|What has caused the demise of singing?
p277/p277_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p277/p277_102|It is annoying.
p277/p277_115|I am just trying to do my job.
p277/p277_337|That has been lost.
p277/p277_117|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p277/p277_287|There's a pause.
p277/p277_402|Emotions were complex.
p277/p277_029|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p277/p277_205|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p277/p277_137|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p277/p277_142|We want to keep the pound.
p277/p277_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p277/p277_416|The people around me were fantastic.
p277/p277_047|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p277/p277_401|What was the difference between them?
p277/p277_041|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p277/p277_088|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p277/p277_420|There's been a mistake.
p277/p277_277|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p277/p277_203|Twaddle is a case in point.
p277/p277_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p277/p277_411|He got his degree.
p277/p277_056|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p277/p277_444|I was lost.
p277/p277_209|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p277/p277_224|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p277/p277_385|It's a real problem.
p277/p277_234|It is hard won.
p277/p277_458|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p277/p277_283|Who did the recruiting?
p277/p277_241|The concerns are the same.
p277/p277_459|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p277/p277_310|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p277/p277_157|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p277/p277_134|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p277/p277_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p277/p277_339|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p277/p277_329|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p277/p277_397|It will take place in July.
p277/p277_168|We've all had the shots.
p277/p277_440|And it showed.
p277/p277_445|The children are fine.
p277/p277_187|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p277/p277_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p277/p277_171|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p277/p277_064|That's the truth.
p277/p277_095|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p277/p277_179|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p277/p277_324|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p277/p277_239|I should think so, too.
p277/p277_358|It's now down in black and white.
p277/p277_340|She said they would appeal.
p277/p277_328|I've got no secret.
p277/p277_383|Yet the data is compelling.
p277/p277_261|The system can work.
p277/p277_438|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p277/p277_330|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p277/p277_300|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p277/p277_078|Painful, but only because it's true.
p277/p277_291|I was brought up in a mining background.
p277/p277_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p277/p277_286|The goals will come.
p277/p277_068|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p277/p277_422|Eriksson would have approved.
p277/p277_184|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p277/p277_147|He realises his mistake.
p277/p277_414|But we finished the show.
p277/p277_326|These days are long gone.
p277/p277_206|In each case they were a goal down.
p277/p277_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p277/p277_120|It is so sad.
p277/p277_294|One was a lawyer.
p277/p277_275|All options are open.
p277/p277_263|We're in shock.
p277/p277_188|Peace was won.
p277/p277_042|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p277/p277_293|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p277/p277_321|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p277/p277_237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p277/p277_197|It was worth a photograph.
p277/p277_413|went on sale.
p277/p277_271|If not, he should go home.
p277/p277_456|If they don't, they should say so.
p277/p277_119|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p277/p277_140|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p277/p277_155|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p277/p277_136|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p277/p277_113|He takes the job.
p277/p277_216|The report is due out next month.
p277/p277_032|He was jailed for five years.
p277/p277_118|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p277/p277_105|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p277/p277_189|It's a fact.
p277/p277_153|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p277/p277_430|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p277/p277_437|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p277/p277_026|Is this accurate?
p277/p277_214|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p277/p277_144|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p277/p277_276|Dialogue is the key.
p277/p277_322|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p277/p277_072|That was a gold medal for certain.
p277/p277_169|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p277/p277_082|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p277/p277_131|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p277/p277_309|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p277/p277_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p277/p277_031|This is the window.
p277/p277_108|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p277/p277_150|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p277/p277_076|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p277/p277_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p277/p277_087|He is in the queue.
p277/p277_220|They must do it.
p277/p277_093|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p277/p277_302|We want to play at the worlds.
p277/p277_235|Our policy is clear.
p277/p277_123|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p277/p277_379|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p277/p277_434|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p277/p277_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p277/p277_044|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p277/p277_292|Nothing is safe.
p277/p277_394|It was a kind of contempt.
p277/p277_092|By then, he was walking on water.
p277/p277_341|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p277/p277_049|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p277/p277_103|But I was wrong.
p277/p277_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p277/p277_246|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p277/p277_357|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p277/p277_346|As, indeed, they would be.
p277/p277_106|Our position remains unchanged.
p277/p277_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p277/p277_149|It is not just about pay.
p277/p277_166|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p277/p277_081|It was magic.
p277/p277_303|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p277/p277_207|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p277/p277_398|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p277/p277_380|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p277/p277_145|Who would be right?
p277/p277_090|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p277/p277_163|It is so unfair.
p277/p277_080|He was at home with his pals.
p277/p277_427|I know the worry over Iraq.
p277/p277_210|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p277/p277_463|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p277/p277_085|Even the one she loved.
p277/p277_257|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p277/p277_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p277/p277_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p277/p277_217|But she was.
p277/p277_143|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p277/p277_181|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p277/p277_316|Off with their heads.
p277/p277_196|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p277/p277_055|He is too weak to move.
p277/p277_146|She died at her home.
p277/p277_453|Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
p277/p277_264|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p277/p277_167|It is not like us.
p277/p277_290|What has altered?
p277/p277_447|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p277/p277_386|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p277/p277_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p277/p277_359|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p277/p277_418|It is legally binding.
p277/p277_091|Someone who cares
p277/p277_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p277/p277_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p277/p277_426|The MoD has denied any cover-up.
p277/p277_269|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p277/p277_074|But I've won both ways.
p277/p277_306|You may have a short memory.
p277/p277_297|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p277/p277_273|He looked very sharp.
p277/p277_355|He could make it.
p277/p277_218|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p277/p277_373|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p277/p277_219|At the time, he was a living legend.
p277/p277_374|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p277/p277_065|They are ready.
p277/p277_178|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p277/p277_352|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p277/p277_428|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p277/p277_244|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p277/p277_200|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p277/p277_314|It's too horrible to think.
p277/p277_262|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p277/p277_215|It's not before time.
p277/p277_094|It is a blow.
p277/p277_156|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p277/p277_226|There is no excuse.
p277/p277_191|We believe a third party was involved.
p277/p277_325|Well, it won't.
p277/p277_336|The performance was excellent.
p277/p277_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p277/p277_060|It had been in place since last July.
p277/p277_421|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p277/p277_405|It is an absolute nonsense.
p277/p277_424|It was little else.
p277/p277_412|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p277/p277_319|Is that an issue?
p277/p277_408|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p277/p277_043|Indeed, he does.
p277/p277_344|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p277/p277_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p277/p277_364|So there, we won.
p277/p277_295|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p277/p277_025|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p277/p277_332|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p277/p277_195|But she might be.
p277/p277_457|It is a vicious circle.
p277/p277_151|So I got a blood test.
p277/p277_160|My Dad is a hero.
p277/p277_135|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p277/p277_046|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p277/p277_030|There's a story, too.
p277/p277_127|I can't even get into the A team.
p277/p277_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p277/p277_442|I hate the word.
p277/p277_260|He was also married with two children.
p277/p277_317|Is there a new way forward?
p277/p277_194|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p277/p277_432|It's been a long, long journey.
p277/p277_233|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p277/p277_075|There was an e-mail.
p277/p277_242|I can't get a job.
p277/p277_248|Is that a serious question?
p277/p277_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p277/p277_425|It all began as an accident.
p277/p277_132|No production was achieved.
p277/p277_371|I am a wealthy person.
p277/p277_062|There was no safety net.
p277/p277_141|I had decided to quit the show.
p277/p277_443|Who would be in that desert?
p277/p277_193|Tommy is not a problem.
p277/p277_238|There wasn't a goal.
p277/p277_435|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p277/p277_054|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p277/p277_100|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p277/p277_311|A review is under way.
p277/p277_399|Is that possible?
p277/p277_366|There is no signature.
p277/p277_236|The scene is about this?
p277/p277_048|We will push.
p277/p277_312|It will work.
p277/p277_403|Then , he laughs.
p277/p277_057|He looks like an Afghan.
p277/p277_114|She reflects a bit.
p277/p277_370|I've never seen a game like it.
p277/p277_172|Does that put pressure on us?
p277/p277_036|Was it worth it?
p277/p277_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p277/p277_240|There's the mix.
p277/p277_448|The whole region is in shock.
p277/p277_349|We will be homeless.
p277/p277_039|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p277/p277_327|Two people were interviewed.
p277/p277_192|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p277/p277_446|They have to come up with a solution.
p277/p277_070|They are real.
p277/p277_281|This is a national crisis.
p277/p277_376|You can cope with it.
p277/p277_211|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p277/p277_284|Bombing slaughter rejected
p277/p277_162|Well, he should know.
p277/p277_351|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p277/p277_161|He can do no wrong.
p277/p277_183|Our team is just so young.
p277/p277_152|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p277/p277_454|Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
p277/p277_298|The plot is minimal.
p277/p277_460|I'd love to be like Peter.
p277/p277_180|They need to look after themselves.
p277/p277_154|I was so nervous.
p277/p277_061|Next league matches Celtic.
p277/p277_051|It is bizarre.
p277/p277_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p277/p277_423|I am extremely cautious.
p277/p277_308|My body is clearly capable.
p277/p277_228|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p277/p277_289|I was the sheep.
p277/p277_059|Here's a clue.
p277/p277_305|We are a peaceful people.
p277/p277_256|This is a question of Islam.
p277/p277_177|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p277/p277_083|It is a job creation scheme.
p277/p277_393|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p277/p277_318|I was invited to work in Germany.
p277/p277_331|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p277/p277_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p277/p277_450|It was a total disaster.
p277/p277_250|They must play for each other.
p277/p277_212|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p277/p277_170|Again, we were lucky.
p277/p277_112|Two of the team became ill.
p277/p277_084|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p277/p277_375|Something is wrong.
p277/p277_396|The car was just there.
p277/p277_323|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p277/p277_278|It was a virus.
p277/p277_190|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p277/p277_265|It's a way of life.
p277/p277_255|We shall rely on human beings.
p277/p277_254|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p277/p277_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p277/p277_267|It was very fast.
p277/p277_390|It's like a basketball.
p277/p277_204|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p277/p277_347|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p277/p277_198|They make a selective perception process.
p277/p277_148|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p277/p277_245|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p277/p277_270|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p277/p277_139|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p277/p277_079|I had my suspicions.
p277/p277_288|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p277/p277_229|But it's a subtle process.
p277/p277_173|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p277/p277_368|He was the architect.
p277/p277_040|They're just different.
p277/p277_342|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p277/p277_050|This represents a tough game for us.
p277/p277_086|Today she has been released.
p277/p277_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p277/p277_419|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p277/p277_107|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p277/p277_378|That's the name of the game, though.
p277/p277_272|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p277/p277_052|They said she was stable.
p277/p277_452|I got a yellow card.
p277/p277_462|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p277/p277_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p277/p277_045|He's just in it for himself.
p277/p277_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p277/p277_199|We have an election in eight days.
p277/p277_338|Tell us about it.
p277/p277_387|I was in the train station overnight.
p277/p277_223|Until they came to do it.
p277/p277_343|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p277/p277_122|It is rubbish.
p277/p277_360|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p277/p277_433|We were used.
p277/p277_296|They are wrong.
p277/p277_027|They have no history.
p277/p277_232|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p277/p277_098|Today I couldn't run on it.
p277/p277_369|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p277/p277_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p277/p277_053|Is a drug dealer?
p277/p277_251|Souter will be back.
p277/p277_033|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p277/p277_034|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p277/p277_282|It was good.
p277/p277_129|She really suffered for her art.
p277/p277_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p277/p277_301|The letters are going out today.
p277/p277_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p277/p277_407|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p277/p277_307|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p277/p277_389|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p277/p277_176|Tony had arrived.
p277/p277_164|I will tell you.
p277/p277_315|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p277/p277_158|We are on a four-year mission.
p277/p277_415|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p277/p277_377|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p277/p277_431|We are all equal.
p277/p277_066|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p277/p277_099|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p277/p277_455|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p277/p277_451|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p277/p277_231|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p277/p277_128|I'm so angry.
p277/p277_109|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p277/p277_304|My whole life has changed.
p277/p277_258|Immediate action must be taken.
p277/p277_101|It was clear.
p277/p277_058|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p277/p277_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p277/p277_116|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p277/p277_395|It was a breathtaking moment.
p277/p277_110|You should be.
p277/p277_299|You are the glory.
p277/p277_372|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p277/p277_201|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p277/p277_354|Not so, it seems.
p277/p277_404|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p277/p277_202|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p277/p277_259|It's very nice.
p277/p277_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p277/p277_274|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p277/p277_381|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p277/p277_230|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p277/p277_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p277/p277_436|They were not even allowed to see them.
p277/p277_417|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p277/p277_063|It is unique.
p277/p277_279|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p233/p233_384|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p233/p233_277|And Michael was just great.
p233/p233_182|He will feel the pain again.
p233/p233_323|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p233/p233_186|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p233/p233_346|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p233/p233_044|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p233/p233_335|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p233/p233_171|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p233/p233_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p233/p233_272|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p233/p233_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p233/p233_164|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p233/p233_327|It added to the spectacle.
p233/p233_342|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p233/p233_001|Please call Stella.
p233/p233_280|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p233/p233_252|A friendship that will endure.
p233/p233_343|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p233/p233_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p233/p233_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p233/p233_178|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p233/p233_102|It is much as it has been described.
p233/p233_241|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p233/p233_212|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p233/p233_091|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p233/p233_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p233/p233_295|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p233/p233_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p233/p233_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p233/p233_243|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p233/p233_064|It was an amazing result.
p233/p233_273|Immediate action must be taken.
p233/p233_183|I always felt they played for me.
p233/p233_236|I can't wait to meet him.
p233/p233_351|He agreed with my proposal.
p233/p233_307|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p233/p233_070|This time, it might be for real.
p233/p233_177|The release attracted little attention.
p233/p233_331|Who will do it?
p233/p233_143|Is that it?
p233/p233_159|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p233/p233_250|There wasn't a goal.
p233/p233_322|We agreed to disagree.
p233/p233_142|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p233/p233_115|We do not expect any surplus.
p233/p233_093|He is in the US.
p233/p233_383|It is unusual.
p233/p233_221|The FBI could become involved.
p233/p233_235|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p233/p233_259|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p233/p233_365|But I managed.
p233/p233_340|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p233/p233_116|You had better believe it.
p233/p233_392|He has not created a Festival resource.
p233/p233_195|It's a joke.
p233/p233_130|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p233/p233_267|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p233/p233_108|In London today, it was business as usual.
p233/p233_349|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p233/p233_369|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p233/p233_050|The strategy is not without risk.
p233/p233_375|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p233/p233_371|We shall not be moved.
p233/p233_223|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p233/p233_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p233/p233_135|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p233/p233_185|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p233/p233_390|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p233/p233_133|It's an amazing landscape!
p233/p233_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p233/p233_214|That will be vital.
p233/p233_190|I was totally wrong.
p233/p233_255|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p233/p233_387|It was a breathtaking moment.
p233/p233_086|How are you, sir?
p233/p233_229|You have to do your research.
p233/p233_338|Nobody else was with me.
p233/p233_366|They play together perfectly.
p233/p233_334|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p233/p233_376|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p233/p233_391|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p233/p233_176|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p233/p233_062|That is all in the past.
p233/p233_043|That means an extra two years.
p233/p233_314|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p233/p233_279|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p233/p233_049|Part of the complex is historic.
p233/p233_077|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p233/p233_325|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p233/p233_055|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p233/p233_345|Eight months later, he was dead.
p233/p233_046|The man became a reporter.
p233/p233_353|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p233/p233_321|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p233/p233_080|On the night, it was not enough.
p233/p233_161|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p233/p233_087|So is that it, then?
p233/p233_192|I've been there.
p233/p233_168|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p233/p233_163|It is not normal practice.
p233/p233_125|That's all right then.
p233/p233_354|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p233/p233_187|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p233/p233_282|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p233/p233_047|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p233/p233_246|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p233/p233_367|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p233/p233_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p233/p233_082|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p233/p233_324|I saw some good things.
p233/p233_226|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p233/p233_128|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p233/p233_121|I joined a group.
p233/p233_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p233/p233_076|We can all make a mistake.
p233/p233_216|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p233/p233_286|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p233/p233_054|We are working on it.
p233/p233_289|He looked very sharp.
p233/p233_302|I thought it was my only chance.
p233/p233_147|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p233/p233_225|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p233/p233_232|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p233/p233_222|Work has started.
p233/p233_139|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p233/p233_033|This is a central issue.
p233/p233_030|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p233/p233_148|Who would be right?
p233/p233_158|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p233/p233_381|It's just outrageous.
p233/p233_100|It should be a condition of employment.
p233/p233_326|Robert is a special talent.
p233/p233_240|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p233/p233_146|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p233/p233_370|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p233/p233_283|I feel pretty good.
p233/p233_095|By then, he was walking on water.
p233/p233_368|Colour was at the core of his life.
p233/p233_220|In each case they were a goal down.
p233/p233_332|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p233/p233_106|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p233/p233_189|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p233/p233_137|I am now unemployed.
p233/p233_063|That could be a mistake.
p233/p233_245|I know I'm in a very special position.
p233/p233_382|The road was closed for several hours.
p233/p233_134|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p233/p233_306|This is a war over our home.
p233/p233_305|They should be swept away.
p233/p233_038|Victory was never in doubt.
p233/p233_165|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p233/p233_160|I was so nervous.
p233/p233_224|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p233/p233_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p233/p233_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p233/p233_157|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p233/p233_389|What happened in the summer?
p233/p233_350|However, it was well worth the wait.
p233/p233_278|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p233/p233_085|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p233/p233_098|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p233/p233_193|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p233/p233_247|The salary changes are long overdue.
p233/p233_199|However, this idea is never developed.
p233/p233_067|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p233/p233_244|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p233/p233_074|We were under a bit of pressure.
p233/p233_251|It was a cry for help.
p233/p233_092|They have a further report to make in March.
p233/p233_173|I have got a wife to feed.
p233/p233_180|We've made a couple of albums.
p233/p233_379|Yet the data is compelling.
p233/p233_209|I have a cold.
p233/p233_094|The Festival is prepared to help.
p233/p233_122|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p233/p233_166|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p233/p233_065|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p233/p233_319|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p233/p233_264|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p233/p233_320|My view has now completely changed.
p233/p233_111|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p233/p233_363|Safety was also an issue.
p233/p233_191|There is no point in looking any further.
p233/p233_073|It starts with the script.
p233/p233_131|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p233/p233_052|I was released after six days.
p233/p233_081|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p233/p233_188|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p233/p233_172|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p233/p233_075|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p233/p233_294|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p233/p233_237|Broke the birdie record.
p233/p233_374|He's a nice guy.
p233/p233_174|It's that sort of night.
p233/p233_123|Who would be a referee?
p233/p233_313|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p233/p233_356|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p233/p233_261|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p233/p233_364|They received a reply from their own managers.
p233/p233_300|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p233/p233_129|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p233/p233_309|We want to play at the worlds.
p233/p233_084|It is not a story.
p233/p233_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p233/p233_112|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p233/p233_167|Neither side can win this war.
p233/p233_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p233/p233_039|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p233/p233_257|I watched a game.
p233/p233_156|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p233/p233_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p233/p233_344|His contract was then not renewed.
p233/p233_297|Who can predict?
p233/p233_132|He's been the key to everything.
p233/p233_179|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p233/p233_175|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p233/p233_107|Everyone had to play the game.
p233/p233_027|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p233/p233_071|She did that for the rest of her life.
p233/p233_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p233/p233_144|I saw some terrible things.
p233/p233_292|It was a virus.
p233/p233_336|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p233/p233_215|We need to handle it.
p233/p233_361|They have not done so this season so far.
p233/p233_249|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p233/p233_210|He had suffered a heart attack.
p233/p233_056|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p233/p233_136|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p233/p233_072|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p233/p233_308|I was in daily contact.
p233/p233_281|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p233/p233_045|All businesses continue to trade.
p233/p233_298|This is a huge confidence boost.
p233/p233_089|What do we do?
p233/p233_269|They are never here.
p233/p233_304|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p233/p233_218|His third goal was superb.
p233/p233_352|Hartley should know.
p233/p233_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p233/p233_201|He may need it.
p233/p233_138|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p233/p233_151|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p233/p233_316|My body is clearly capable.
p233/p233_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p233/p233_317|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p233/p233_266|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p233/p233_170|I will tell you.
p233/p233_196|I had a train to catch.
p233/p233_127|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p233/p233_117|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p233/p233_041|I have never been a member of the council.
p233/p233_265|It is not just about pay.
p233/p233_234|My neighbours are horrified.
p233/p233_068|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p233/p233_099|That is the fact of the matter.
p233/p233_105|He has become a monster.
p233/p233_079|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p233/p233_290|All options are open.
p233/p233_184|Is Saddam a threat?
p233/p233_053|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p233/p233_311|Is there on his hands?
p233/p233_181|They thought they had found a home.
p233/p233_060|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p233/p233_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p233/p233_296|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p233/p233_198|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p233/p233_169|It is so unfair.
p233/p233_253|This year I understood.
p233/p233_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p233/p233_230|We played them off the pitch.
p233/p233_377|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p233/p233_154|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p233/p233_155|He will emerge as a world leader.
p233/p233_119|My office is bare.
p233/p233_337|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p233/p233_208|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p233/p233_025|We are a service industry.
p233/p233_120|I'm delighted about that.
p233/p233_360|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p233/p233_339|I've learned from my mistakes.
p233/p233_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p233/p233_141|Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
p233/p233_113|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p233/p233_203|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p233/p233_263|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p233/p233_217|I had relied on him.
p233/p233_150|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p233/p233_275|It was an easy decision to come here.
p233/p233_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p233/p233_026|But we will have to wait.
p233/p233_103|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p233/p233_386|That set the tone.
p233/p233_101|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p233/p233_285|It was a privilege to work for him.
p233/p233_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p233/p233_357|Equity declined to comment.
p233/p233_288|They were too hard.
p233/p233_347|He had played well in that central role.
p233/p233_110|We are currently working on the details.
p233/p233_388|I was in jail for five years.
p233/p233_104|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p233/p233_271|It looks as though he will be right.
p233/p233_061|You have to be patient.
p233/p233_315|The problems began a long time ago.
p233/p233_274|He is a young man with a new deal.
p233/p233_149|She died at her home.
p233/p233_097|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p233/p233_162|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p233/p233_051|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p233/p233_276|It is the same in Sweden.
p233/p233_153|It would be a last resort.
p233/p233_118|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p233/p233_373|It was a hit.
p233/p233_083|They were badly prepared for it.
p233/p233_204|It wasn't to be.
p233/p233_248|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p233/p233_194|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p233/p233_088|Do I have a favourite?
p233/p233_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p233/p233_310|This is the culture change in medicine.
p233/p233_231|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p233/p233_256|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p233/p233_355|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p233/p233_284|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p233/p233_066|He has not been dropped.
p233/p233_291|The attacker died in the crash.
p233/p233_238|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p233/p233_329|He told the court.
p233/p233_348|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p233/p233_254|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p233/p233_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p233/p233_328|Who was the mystery MP?
p233/p233_239|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p233/p233_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p233/p233_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p233/p233_152|It is like a football team.
p233/p233_341|The composer will conduct.
p233/p233_260|I was happily surprised.
p233/p233_378|The mood was defiant.
p233/p233_042|He was in his element.
p233/p233_358|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p233/p233_213|It was worth a photograph.
p233/p233_385|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p233/p233_140|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p233/p233_233|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p233/p233_299|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p233/p233_268|Blood samples were taken.
p233/p233_057|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p233/p233_262|It is also very valuable.
p233/p233_270|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p233/p233_032|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p233/p233_333|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p233/p233_048|It is all starting to come together.
p233/p233_114|It was the eighties.
p233/p233_197|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p233/p233_303|One was a lawyer.
p233/p233_242|We were extremely poor.
p233/p233_258|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p233/p233_059|There was no safety net.
p233/p233_040|We are the party of the future.
p233/p233_228|Mental health is a massive issue.
p233/p233_200|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p233/p233_359|He could make it.
p233/p233_109|It is not affected by the sale.
p233/p233_090|Why do it otherwise?
p233/p233_301|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p233/p233_330|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p233/p233_312|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p233/p233_211|A deadline is still essential.
p233/p233_096|I had a bit in hand.
p329/p329_223|I'm really happy with the way it went.
p329/p329_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p329/p329_120|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p329/p329_178|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p329/p329_117|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p329/p329_352|It is a decision which has paid off.
p329/p329_033|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p329/p329_409|Players were held in equally low regard.
p329/p329_249|We told them in August.
p329/p329_312|But both were involved with other matters.
p329/p329_150|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p329/p329_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p329/p329_288|Then followed a bout of flu.
p329/p329_357|You don't do the same thing with men.
p329/p329_398|The issue has still to be resolved.
p329/p329_181|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p329/p329_297|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p329/p329_030|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p329/p329_278|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p329/p329_070|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p329/p329_222|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p329/p329_201|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p329/p329_198|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p329/p329_100|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p329/p329_068|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p329/p329_050|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p329/p329_397|It brings together two essential elements.
p329/p329_192|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p329/p329_315|There is no threat to them.
p329/p329_420|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p329/p329_290|We had no part in it.
p329/p329_277|He doesn't do dinner.
p329/p329_145|This can only help us go forward.
p329/p329_258|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p329/p329_086|I feel very strongly about that.
p329/p329_348|First is open defiance.
p329/p329_148|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p329/p329_399|He is a joy to watch.
p329/p329_176|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p329/p329_322|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p329/p329_390|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p329/p329_402|People ask about the concept of a team.
p329/p329_165|That's the way it is.
p329/p329_269|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p329/p329_285|Maybe this battle has been.
p329/p329_173|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p329/p329_347|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p329/p329_133|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p329/p329_026|This could be one such case, he declared.
p329/p329_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p329/p329_130|It was an ambush.
p329/p329_067|The Commons is too outdated.
p329/p329_405|They've been here before.
p329/p329_353|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p329/p329_339|I'll take the blame for that.
p329/p329_376|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p329/p329_248|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p329/p329_299|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p329/p329_113|It has been hijacked.
p329/p329_157|I have great respect for all my players.
p329/p329_381|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p329/p329_235|This is my new career.
p329/p329_154|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p329/p329_156|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p329/p329_239|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p329/p329_293|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p329/p329_289|I have worked with him on projects.
p329/p329_279|That's a very strong element.
p329/p329_096|Jamming would be equally difficult.
p329/p329_238|I would urge the Government to think again.
p329/p329_121|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p329/p329_338|It might have been a satanic ritual.
p329/p329_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p329/p329_072|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p329/p329_313|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p329/p329_215|The court has not decided.
p329/p329_262|I have no argument with Scotland.
p329/p329_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p329/p329_294|The referee had been right.
p329/p329_265|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p329/p329_284|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p329/p329_385|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p329/p329_195|It is a scandal.
p329/p329_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p329/p329_250|That could be at least five years away.
p329/p329_147|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p329/p329_268|Now that was a boxing movie.
p329/p329_207|We will look into it.
p329/p329_286|The manager is there to make these decisions.
p329/p329_131|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p329/p329_074|They seem to be backing off from that.
p329/p329_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p329/p329_344|Our house was very small.
p329/p329_311|Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
p329/p329_298|This is not a faceless system.
p329/p329_204|He was jailed for five years.
p329/p329_310|The campaign was raucous.
p329/p329_058|I have had no social life at all.
p329/p329_418|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p329/p329_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p329/p329_122|David was not either.
p329/p329_389|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p329/p329_094|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p329/p329_371|I joined a group.
p329/p329_179|It is too early to speculate.
p329/p329_410|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p329/p329_213|We did not talk about it.
p329/p329_231|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p329/p329_243|There is no change in our position.
p329/p329_232|This represents a tough game for us.
p329/p329_155|I guess it is down to focus.
p329/p329_358|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p329/p329_422|The country is in a state of chaos.
p329/p329_408|It would show them a positive way forward.
p329/p329_309|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p329/p329_414|He was not seeking special advantage.
p329/p329_292|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p329/p329_359|Pray that it is so.
p329/p329_346|Later they changed their minds.
p329/p329_162|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p329/p329_071|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p329/p329_282|He was at home with his pals.
p329/p329_271|I might also completely change the routine.
p329/p329_034|We don't know the scale of need.
p329/p329_404|The film is about the cost of genius.
p329/p329_308|Clearly, that is important in nursing.
p329/p329_261|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p329/p329_423|What will happen if it all goes wrong?
p329/p329_062|I am still pretty young in this business.
p329/p329_048|He was just a journalist.
p329/p329_111|They agree to meet.
p329/p329_229|It's a difficult job.
p329/p329_206|We will not break even.
p329/p329_124|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p329/p329_401|We are now open.
p329/p329_356|We do not expect any surplus.
p329/p329_252|I have no comment to make.
p329/p329_331|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p329/p329_041|He will never walk the streets again.
p329/p329_362|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p329/p329_363|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p329/p329_061|His charisma is all on the course.
p329/p329_129|I didn't play well last year.
p329/p329_038|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p329/p329_116|She had been sexually assaulted.
p329/p329_108|It may be argued.
p329/p329_230|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p329/p329_374|But we could not change his mind.
p329/p329_236|It really was a masterful innings.
p329/p329_170|There was even a joke.
p329/p329_394|As if he were a High Court judge.
p329/p329_387|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p329/p329_218|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p329/p329_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p329/p329_194|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p329/p329_095|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p329/p329_137|I felt under no pressure today.
p329/p329_370|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p329/p329_205|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p329/p329_042|There are big names.
p329/p329_375|We have a team to reach the final.
p329/p329_189|I think it's awful.
p329/p329_047|The bill would be massive.
p329/p329_168|I am not a magician.
p329/p329_251|That is my role.
p329/p329_379|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p329/p329_200|But these were the nights.
p329/p329_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p329/p329_197|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p329/p329_153|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p329/p329_354|Their mind was already made up.
p329/p329_342|There is great interest on our island.
p329/p329_242|I leave tonight for England.
p329/p329_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p329/p329_224|It is a step on the way.
p329/p329_382|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p329/p329_136|Each one has its own system.
p329/p329_326|There was barely a handful of chances.
p329/p329_141|That is a job for the Government.
p329/p329_228|All businesses continue to trade.
p329/p329_025|But there has never been the time, she said.
p329/p329_267|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p329/p329_220|Four people died instantly.
p329/p329_393|My father died in childbirth.
p329/p329_364|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p329/p329_403|Who has he fought?
p329/p329_039|We're still talking with a few people.
p329/p329_360|No, is the answer to your first question.
p329/p329_366|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p329/p329_087|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p329/p329_321|It is high time to act.
p329/p329_191|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p329/p329_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p329/p329_175|It is highly unlikely.
p329/p329_395|And that started me thinking.
p329/p329_079|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p329/p329_350|I just had so much fun.
p329/p329_126|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p329/p329_291|His father and mother are in film production.
p329/p329_419|We've come from a long way back.
p329/p329_127|There is no smoking gun.
p329/p329_187|What is the truth about the cow?
p329/p329_090|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p329/p329_174|She had experience of the wildest places.
p329/p329_027|It's not a solo.
p329/p329_037|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p329/p329_060|In short, the club was broke.
p329/p329_219|We find this very sad.
p329/p329_226|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p329/p329_212|Three years probation is just a joke.
p329/p329_132|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p329/p329_092|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p329/p329_332|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p329/p329_217|I get to work with very good people.
p329/p329_380|I never agreed with that.
p329/p329_391|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p329/p329_125|More patience and composure was required.
p329/p329_318|The woman is basically off her head.
p329/p329_103|We make good weapons.
p329/p329_167|I see the extended family once a year.
p329/p329_270|There was a battle there.
p329/p329_424|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p329/p329_049|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p329/p329_078|This avalanche is just beginning.
p329/p329_210|What did they think of her voice?
p329/p329_209|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p329/p329_345|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p329/p329_028|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p329/p329_114|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p329/p329_302|I'm feeling very pleased.
p329/p329_253|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p329/p329_081|I was there for five hours.
p329/p329_259|He was a crazy man.
p329/p329_029|I fell in love with ballet.
p329/p329_164|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p329/p329_097|Drugs are always an issue.
p329/p329_305|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p329/p329_378|I see no reason for them to be.
p329/p329_166|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p329/p329_139|And that was the adults.
p329/p329_172|You probably have never seen them before.
p329/p329_295|Our young people are leaving.
p329/p329_119|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p329/p329_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p329/p329_184|Or so we have long assumed.
p329/p329_088|He just wants to play.
p329/p329_040|We know you will not let us down.
p329/p329_138|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p329/p329_306|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p329/p329_227|People tended to stay there for some time.
p329/p329_316|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p329/p329_340|It is now time for justice.
p329/p329_280|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p329/p329_274|I'd never heard him in person before.
p329/p329_254|He also presented You Bet!
p329/p329_054|She has a wonderful mind.
p329/p329_406|I want a free vote.
p329/p329_160|For a moment it was all about her.
p329/p329_045|I hope you will leave it at that.
p329/p329_115|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p329/p329_188|They will want to watch a winning team.
p329/p329_069|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p329/p329_052|How can they engage with the work?
p329/p329_001|Please call Stella.
p329/p329_152|Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
p329/p329_377|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p329/p329_400|We have high hopes that this will work.
p329/p329_075|This will be no easy option.
p329/p329_233|The boy is no longer with us.
p329/p329_085|There are no excuses.
p329/p329_112|They could not hear.
p329/p329_336|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p329/p329_421|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p329/p329_225|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p329/p329_329|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p329/p329_327|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p329/p329_333|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p329/p329_171|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p329/p329_335|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p329/p329_392|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p329/p329_307|A play is a set of actions.
p329/p329_247|We must learn from the past.
p329/p329_296|That would have been too easy.
p329/p329_109|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p329/p329_036|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p329/p329_349|That is absolute nonsense.
p329/p329_384|It is a dilemma.
p329/p329_169|We couldn't go very fast.
p329/p329_035|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p329/p329_413|They have the cash to do that.
p329/p329_202|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p329/p329_367|So what does one do?
p329/p329_355|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p329/p329_301|That is just a load of baloney.
p329/p329_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p329/p329_055|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p329/p329_128|The trial is set for February.
p329/p329_135|I have so much respect for him.
p329/p329_091|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p329/p329_255|I just went a bit too far.
p329/p329_221|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p329/p329_098|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p329/p329_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p329/p329_246|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p329/p329_337|We have nothing to hide.
p329/p329_287|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p329/p329_412|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p329/p329_190|Who is going to be penalised?
p329/p329_146|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p329/p329_177|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p329/p329_303|The damage from the fire was huge.
p329/p329_323|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p329/p329_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p329/p329_328|But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
p329/p329_186|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p329/p329_369|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p329/p329_118|That is different from being impartial.
p329/p329_388|They did not interfere.
p329/p329_244|Everything else is a bonus.
p329/p329_056|We're into that build-up now.
p329/p329_383|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p329/p329_151|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p329/p329_415|There was a fine line to tread.
p329/p329_407|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p329/p329_245|We went on to become very successful.
p329/p329_064|We're not the tourist board.
p329/p329_043|That argument has been won.
p329/p329_325|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p329/p329_185|They responded with victories.
p329/p329_149|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p329/p329_411|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p329/p329_183|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p329/p329_300|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p329/p329_334|That is not the way we should operate.
p329/p329_076|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p329/p329_396|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p329/p329_330|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p329/p329_093|I want to play at the highest level.
p329/p329_104|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p329/p329_084|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p329/p329_324|The South African defended his work ethic.
p329/p329_110|I bought a car at auction.
p329/p329_203|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p329/p329_208|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p329/p329_266|I hope he stays.
p329/p329_240|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p329/p329_182|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p329/p329_317|Nelson does not disappoint.
p329/p329_368|Such actions are rarely popular.
p329/p329_275|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p329/p329_142|And he had much need.
p329/p329_073|He would be with his peers.
p329/p329_082|But then he changed his mind.
p329/p329_083|I don't know why she is not here.
p329/p329_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p329/p329_163|Trading Places was too obvious.
p329/p329_158|His track record is not promising.
p329/p329_193|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p329/p329_199|I have a theory.
p329/p329_180|I love the moment of being first.
p329/p329_365|We have been preparing all year.
p329/p329_319|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p329/p329_372|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p329/p329_196|Nor should there have been.
p329/p329_077|I am so sorry.
p329/p329_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p329/p329_106|The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
p329/p329_281|I have beaten her a few times.
p329/p329_059|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p329/p329_304|She had kept the news from him.
p329/p329_234|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p329/p329_089|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p329/p329_272|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p329/p329_032|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p329/p329_080|We will see how he is after treatment.
p329/p329_063|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p329/p329_361|There was support from across the board.
p329/p329_283|We are taking it seriously.
p329/p329_264|It was also put on the Internet.
p329/p329_159|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p329/p329_320|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p329/p329_161|It will be a great night.
p329/p329_144|The other children were severely mentally impaired.
p329/p329_216|We are opening an inquiry.
p329/p329_373|They probably expected something special from me.
p329/p329_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p329/p329_417|It is so elusive and light.
p329/p329_053|I have been coming here for nine years.
p329/p329_065|It was the same old story.
p329/p329_066|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p329/p329_260|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p329/p329_102|There is no guarantee.
p329/p329_057|It is the end of an era.
p329/p329_044|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p329/p329_214|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p329/p329_107|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p329/p329_273|It's good news and long overdue.
p329/p329_143|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p329/p329_211|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p329/p329_237|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p329/p329_263|And a film maker was born.
p329/p329_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p329/p329_256|And how he kept his word.
p329/p329_134|Is that too much to ask?
p329/p329_257|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p329/p329_140|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p329/p329_123|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p329/p329_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p329/p329_343|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p329/p329_341|That is no use.
p329/p329_051|I didn't have a clue.
p329/p329_416|Yet it is all for two good causes.
p329/p329_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p329/p329_046|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p329/p329_314|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p329/p329_031|I had found my vision.
p329/p329_101|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p329/p329_241|I was happiest with my short game.
p329/p329_105|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p329/p329_351|It was quite rigorous.
p329/p329_276|I saw them not long after it happened.
p329/p329_386|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p329/p329_099|This kind of problem arises everywhere.
p329/p329_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p318/p318_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p318/p318_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p318/p318_103|Although, you never know.
p318/p318_117|They will be destroyed.
p318/p318_183|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p318/p318_110|I took the gun.
p318/p318_287|The end result is precisely the same.
p318/p318_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p318/p318_323|As if they ever stopped.
p318/p318_321|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p318/p318_196|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p318/p318_156|If so, we want to hear from them.
p318/p318_079|They must be kept on the ground.
p318/p318_040|They hit me in the head.
p318/p318_091|It's a very, very special day.
p318/p318_366|The idea was presented to me.
p318/p318_317|They deserve a lot of credit.
p318/p318_311|Could you put it in writing?
p318/p318_197|They should feel ashamed.
p318/p318_090|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p318/p318_367|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p318/p318_279|Why should he go anywhere?
p318/p318_116|We act because we must.
p318/p318_164|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p318/p318_288|We have it on video.
p318/p318_248|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p318/p318_037|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p318/p318_228|And then a funny thing happened.
p318/p318_406|It's going to be a new challenge.
p318/p318_144|They played it like a cup final.
p318/p318_298|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p318/p318_375|That was never their agenda.
p318/p318_385|We could learn a lot from them.
p318/p318_063|I was chosen to do this.
p318/p318_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p318/p318_099|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p318/p318_105|The quality of work is very impressive.
p318/p318_255|Our people are paying high prices.
p318/p318_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p318/p318_419|I didn't play all that well.
p318/p318_238|There is nothing to fear.
p318/p318_224|There is no margin for error.
p318/p318_077|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p318/p318_264|We are playing them at their own game.
p318/p318_042|That, though, was just the start of it.
p318/p318_180|We won't do that.
p318/p318_384|We have been preparing all year.
p318/p318_345|Staff have been informed.
p318/p318_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p318/p318_069|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p318/p318_342|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p318/p318_420|Who can tell?
p318/p318_312|I am not a paedophile.
p318/p318_148|A review of the decision is being sought.
p318/p318_159|They may differ on other issues.
p318/p318_113|We played so well at times.
p318/p318_214|We are a party for people, not against people.
p318/p318_134|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p318/p318_147|We haven't found out anything different.
p318/p318_356|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p318/p318_057|We might be back next year.
p318/p318_089|This gives us a lot of practice.
p318/p318_055|Her role in it was small.
p318/p318_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p318/p318_415|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p318/p318_350|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p318/p318_153|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p318/p318_187|Her daughter is getting married.
p318/p318_209|The night is young.
p318/p318_368|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p318/p318_098|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p318/p318_230|She asked us a lot of questions.
p318/p318_274|My mother is a widow.
p318/p318_359|The hotel was huge.
p318/p318_286|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p318/p318_149|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p318/p318_362|It was the same at Twickenham.
p318/p318_121|It was a journey into a new life.
p318/p318_112|A web site is planned for November.
p318/p318_271|I expect a rapid response.
p318/p318_199|So they will settle again.
p318/p318_032|It was important to win the singles.
p318/p318_221|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p318/p318_409|He deserves a top team.
p318/p318_338|They've been wonderful to me.
p318/p318_392|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p318/p318_282|I'm confident we can do that.
p318/p318_044|We have not had a formal request.
p318/p318_205|So she told him.
p318/p318_047|We offered something different.
p318/p318_130|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p318/p318_391|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p318/p318_170|There is a simmering anger out there.
p318/p318_276|There have been different reports from different people.
p318/p318_143|However, consumers may take a different view.
p318/p318_344|It's a question of perception.
p318/p318_261|He was in contention almost every week.
p318/p318_371|I see it as my job.
p318/p318_316|But then they scored their fourth.
p318/p318_395|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p318/p318_400|His primary residence is Scotland.
p318/p318_100|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p318/p318_382|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p318/p318_306|It may well have been.
p318/p318_145|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p318/p318_177|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p318/p318_158|Who was on the panel?
p318/p318_422|Now, that is a good deal.
p318/p318_346|My heart is not so sure.
p318/p318_124|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p318/p318_267|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p318/p318_289|I am not a threat to coaches.
p318/p318_190|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p318/p318_101|This is my personal assessment.
p318/p318_206|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p318/p318_168|This one is a special case.
p318/p318_203|This is not a European Army.
p318/p318_285|I would never even consider it.
p318/p318_204|Election results are expected soon.
p318/p318_263|It is up to Ann.
p318/p318_296|Is being naturally funny enough?
p318/p318_401|I found that much more challenging.
p318/p318_128|What has changed since then?
p318/p318_284|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p318/p318_295|We gave them the goal.
p318/p318_365|They took a risk.
p318/p318_335|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p318/p318_325|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p318/p318_056|I have really noticed that this week.
p318/p318_102|There was no trouble at all.
p318/p318_049|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p318/p318_413|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p318/p318_412|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p318/p318_339|I can't believe the buzz.
p318/p318_118|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p318/p318_372|This was not a summit about the euro.
p318/p318_051|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p318/p318_256|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p318/p318_219|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p318/p318_064|I learned a lot from that.
p318/p318_266|I had trouble with the producers.
p318/p318_132|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p318/p318_388|I was released after six days.
p318/p318_258|Or so everyone believed.
p318/p318_119|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p318/p318_111|It's just one of those things.
p318/p318_041|But he is not using them.
p318/p318_387|Sure, we have problems.
p318/p318_330|We are now in an election period.
p318/p318_231|It was a stunning strike.
p318/p318_275|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p318/p318_301|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p318/p318_254|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p318/p318_068|However, there is great potential in this right.
p318/p318_034|That is impressive by any standards.
p318/p318_403|It would have been very easily done.
p318/p318_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p318/p318_081|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p318/p318_039|It helped to get me noticed.
p318/p318_303|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p318/p318_165|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p318/p318_244|This was done by the council staff.
p318/p318_240|Life was like a timetable.
p318/p318_078|We are confident of taking that back.
p318/p318_061|The firm was down and almost out.
p318/p318_294|That, though, is to miss the point.
p318/p318_155|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p318/p318_308|It was a simple question.
p318/p318_084|That's why the ministers resigned.
p318/p318_186|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p318/p318_104|We shall be victorious.
p318/p318_252|The man became a reporter.
p318/p318_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p318/p318_379|I enjoy the creative process.
p318/p318_076|This was much worse.
p318/p318_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p318/p318_394|You can't go back and change things.
p318/p318_200|How do we get more people in?
p318/p318_416|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p318/p318_383|It's always the same, isn't it?
p318/p318_086|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p318/p318_146|But the championship is not over yet.
p318/p318_038|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p318/p318_157|I am not blaming audiences.
p318/p318_358|Closure is not one of them.
p318/p318_191|We have understood the problems for some time.
p318/p318_125|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p318/p318_370|The hearing was fair.
p318/p318_393|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p318/p318_093|There's also the point.
p318/p318_408|I want to keep him.
p318/p318_060|It is not a standing army.
p318/p318_031|I thought it was quite good.
p318/p318_227|That figure will always remain with me.
p318/p318_220|Some of the players have not progressed.
p318/p318_001|Please call Stella.
p318/p318_070|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p318/p318_397|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p318/p318_369|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p318/p318_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p318/p318_327|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p318/p318_242|I tried to push him away.
p318/p318_163|It was a fiery game.
p318/p318_028|I intend to raise the matter there.
p318/p318_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p318/p318_246|We haven't come out of this very well.
p318/p318_421|It appears to have been closed down.
p318/p318_233|They hold on for many years.
p318/p318_169|But what are the songs about?
p318/p318_418|Would they work together again?
p318/p318_126|What's the point?
p318/p318_096|That's the National Grid.
p318/p318_347|This morning was very quiet.
p318/p318_237|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p318/p318_062|They said they were only young men.
p318/p318_326|For a few years we had good fun.
p318/p318_336|He pleaded for caution.
p318/p318_411|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p318/p318_332|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p318/p318_211|I suspect that it will.
p318/p318_213|The squad will be the same for France.
p318/p318_176|It is very much a matter for them.
p318/p318_202|It looks as though there is no chance.
p318/p318_218|It is not a wish list.
p318/p318_059|It's back to how it used to be.
p318/p318_141|That sort of thing is long gone.
p318/p318_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p318/p318_067|Sandy was very active.
p318/p318_373|Frank Warren is a great man.
p318/p318_173|The stadium was full.
p318/p318_082|This does not help.
p318/p318_080|Did they give any good advice?
p318/p318_386|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p318/p318_417|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p318/p318_281|It was a foolhardy decision.
p318/p318_232|It is a technique.
p318/p318_142|It is typical of me.
p318/p318_278|Something was plainly wrong.
p318/p318_270|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p318/p318_423|The whole nation will be delighted.
p318/p318_185|The United Nations must act.
p318/p318_253|It is a memorial.
p318/p318_315|The odds are that it will.
p318/p318_340|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p318/p318_355|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p318/p318_398|He says it often enough.
p318/p318_027|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p318/p318_381|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p318/p318_377|She is currently in foster care.
p318/p318_337|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p318/p318_354|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p318/p318_329|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p318/p318_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p318/p318_071|There were no formal announcements.
p318/p318_310|And we have beaten them before.
p318/p318_414|We never agreed to it.
p318/p318_405|The Open champion is back.
p318/p318_109|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p318/p318_343|It's no less intriguing, however.
p318/p318_250|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p318/p318_048|We were very much a happy family.
p318/p318_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p318/p318_139|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p318/p318_216|We are still paying the price for that.
p318/p318_192|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p318/p318_357|It seems very odd.
p318/p318_215|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p318/p318_043|We are not moving in.
p318/p318_272|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p318/p318_166|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p318/p318_331|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p318/p318_074|But you can go beyond that condition.
p318/p318_106|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p318/p318_092|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p318/p318_115|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p318/p318_380|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p318/p318_376|She died at her home.
p318/p318_167|It will not be easy for him.
p318/p318_189|They were that poor.
p318/p318_399|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p318/p318_424|We have no plans for direct action.
p318/p318_293|This year, it was a little different.
p318/p318_299|The incident is being taken seriously.
p318/p318_033|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p318/p318_257|Nor is it likely to do so.
p318/p318_208|It was good to score the goal today.
p318/p318_322|But will they fall in love?
p318/p318_319|Why is that?
p318/p318_273|There is no more money.
p318/p318_313|Some of their movement was excellent.
p318/p318_122|It's a way of making a mark.
p318/p318_239|I was an athlete.
p318/p318_212|But there's no eye contact.
p318/p318_137|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p318/p318_058|In a way he was.
p318/p318_129|Raymond was always on the outside.
p318/p318_236|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p318/p318_318|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p318/p318_083|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p318/p318_152|I am ashamed of them.
p318/p318_114|I was very fortunate.
p318/p318_234|Is it the shape of things to come?
p318/p318_360|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p318/p318_150|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p318/p318_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p318/p318_226|From our point of view, it is the right time.
p318/p318_309|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p318/p318_352|Two others were also seriously injured.
p318/p318_207|There are moments of honesty, too.
p318/p318_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p318/p318_349|It has been handled entirely properly.
p318/p318_161|I can make one further announcement.
p318/p318_305|SO now we know the secret.
p318/p318_302|I can feel the sound inside.
p318/p318_179|He's got a great chance of making it.
p318/p318_097|But Allen is deadly serious.
p318/p318_225|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p318/p318_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p318/p318_404|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p318/p318_363|This is an internal matter.
p318/p318_095|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p318/p318_241|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p318/p318_262|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p318/p318_222|If not, he should go home.
p318/p318_223|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p318/p318_402|This fight is not going to go away.
p318/p318_268|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p318/p318_045|I never had a childhood.
p318/p318_280|One thing is sure.
p318/p318_314|But they had to be paid for.
p318/p318_053|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p318/p318_072|Before the games it was pretty open.
p318/p318_030|We have to put this behind us.
p318/p318_073|It really has left the town in shock.
p318/p318_210|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p318/p318_094|It was forced to divert.
p318/p318_178|Any error is severely punished.
p318/p318_194|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p318/p318_087|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p318/p318_300|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p318/p318_348|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p318/p318_389|That time is not far away.
p318/p318_193|All these things have an impact.
p318/p318_217|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p318/p318_361|Well, you can have a tree.
p318/p318_127|Why is this?
p318/p318_085|He has lost confidence and weight.
p318/p318_026|It is never an easy game.
p318/p318_201|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p318/p318_162|The General Election is all to play for.
p318/p318_174|Dewar is the medium.
p318/p318_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p318/p318_229|It does not take much.
p318/p318_108|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p318/p318_140|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p318/p318_029|However, it's good to turn the page.
p318/p318_123|There is a great carry over value.
p318/p318_133|I am sorry to hear this news.
p318/p318_328|It went on to become an annual event.
p318/p318_260|I read it every year.
p318/p318_396|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p318/p318_188|His manager blamed the referee.
p318/p318_182|From now on there is no hiding place.
p318/p318_353|He was made redundant in February last year.
p318/p318_324|The referee had a shocking game.
p318/p318_135|I mean it happens.
p318/p318_292|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p318/p318_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p318/p318_291|It's never over until it's over.
p318/p318_171|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p318/p318_304|I am not a fan of books.
p318/p318_364|I am amazed at what he's done.
p318/p318_136|This week is a perfect example.
p318/p318_198|This is a really serious issue.
p318/p318_277|It's an absolute disgrace.
p318/p318_249|We should be rewarded for producing.
p318/p318_054|He will be judged by his actions.
p318/p318_307|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p318/p318_247|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p318/p318_245|The truth is otherwise.
p318/p318_046|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p318/p318_351|That might help a bit.
p318/p318_160|He had never run the distance before.
p318/p318_036|The waiting is over, well almost.
p318/p318_107|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p318/p318_334|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p318/p318_283|Funding needs to be long term.
p318/p318_035|We are doing very well as we are.
p318/p318_138|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p318/p318_025|They will be dealt with.
p318/p318_297|What's the point of staying sober?
p318/p318_151|Surely it can do better than that?
p318/p318_065|The house was so well alight.
p318/p318_131|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p318/p318_154|The salary changes are long overdue.
p318/p318_243|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p318/p318_341|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p318/p318_120|The Tory party will last.
p318/p318_251|Which, in effect, it is.
p318/p318_320|Then came the crunch.
p318/p318_184|He quit in October.
p318/p318_088|This could be her way forward.
p318/p318_378|That's the only thing that matters.
p318/p318_333|But when we do it is great.
p318/p318_172|That is not a position they enjoy.
p318/p318_052|What were they?
p318/p318_410|I knew people on that committee.
p318/p318_235|My body is exhausted.
p318/p318_407|As, indeed, they would be.
p318/p318_066|He got his degree.
p318/p318_265|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p318/p318_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p318/p318_181|I hope we do.
p318/p318_195|They believed it worked.
p318/p318_075|I'm so worried about the roads.
p318/p318_269|The conference is the first test.
p318/p318_259|Perhaps we should do the same.
p318/p318_050|My brother is buried under there.
p318/p318_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p318/p318_175|It was that kind of night.
p318/p318_390|I may think about performing it.
p318/p318_374|I am a little bit tired.
p279/p279_133|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p279/p279_396|You ask the question.
p279/p279_171|My life has been destroyed.
p279/p279_170|Nobody did in those days.
p279/p279_092|They lived for their children.
p279/p279_098|The peace process will be buried!
p279/p279_094|Yet, it worked.
p279/p279_077|It seemed so personal.
p279/p279_326|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p279/p279_363|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p279/p279_210|I don't want to use it.
p279/p279_057|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p279/p279_104|I see no need for change.
p279/p279_285|It was a virus.
p279/p279_249|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p279/p279_153|It was the same at Twickenham.
p279/p279_264|Blood samples were taken.
p279/p279_093|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p279/p279_149|You know the type.
p279/p279_288|It's like a high school play.
p279/p279_047|That period was a struggle.
p279/p279_291|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p279/p279_029|Is this accurate?
p279/p279_293|It changed my life.
p279/p279_376|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p279/p279_343|You need a licence to run a pub.
p279/p279_378|It doesn't always work that way.
p279/p279_114|This is a step backwards.
p279/p279_174|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p279/p279_271|It is the same in Sweden.
p279/p279_392|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p279/p279_144|Is that Titanic?
p279/p279_131|Well, you can have a tree.
p279/p279_117|My office is bare.
p279/p279_087|This is the way things should be handled.
p279/p279_318|I came into this world with nothing.
p279/p279_164|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p279/p279_037|They're just different.
p279/p279_039|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p279/p279_328|Was this element always there?
p279/p279_261|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p279/p279_358|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p279/p279_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p279/p279_351|Hartley should know.
p279/p279_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p279/p279_096|It is an old family habit.
p279/p279_113|I was angry.
p279/p279_297|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p279/p279_124|You can spend money on housing.
p279/p279_201|Tommy is not a problem.
p279/p279_188|Does this matter?
p279/p279_366|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p279/p279_041|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p279/p279_245|The scene is about this?
p279/p279_406|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p279/p279_155|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p279/p279_234|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p279/p279_085|It works for us.
p279/p279_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p279/p279_192|It is tough, but possible.
p279/p279_182|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p279/p279_190|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p279/p279_197|It was typical.
p279/p279_215|Twaddle is a case in point.
p279/p279_312|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p279/p279_305|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p279/p279_316|Craig is a major concern for us.
p279/p279_125|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p279/p279_095|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p279/p279_090|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p279/p279_383|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p279/p279_128|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p279/p279_377|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p279/p279_165|Tell it like it was?
p279/p279_069|Art is extra.
p279/p279_068|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p279/p279_302|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p279/p279_151|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p279/p279_238|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p279/p279_308|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p279/p279_275|The script was funny.
p279/p279_239|You take a risk.
p279/p279_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p279/p279_102|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p279/p279_324|He was then replaced by Ross.
p279/p279_063|Sadly, it can't.
p279/p279_169|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p279/p279_349|I kept going for her.
p279/p279_062|He had no enemies.
p279/p279_353|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p279/p279_035|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p279/p279_086|It is a time bomb.
p279/p279_314|It is all credit to them today.
p279/p279_404|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p279/p279_255|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p279/p279_374|That's the name of the game, though.
p279/p279_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p279/p279_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p279/p279_270|It was an easy decision to come here.
p279/p279_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p279/p279_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p279/p279_187|It's a joke.
p279/p279_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p279/p279_050|The judge said.
p279/p279_136|I am now unemployed.
p279/p279_186|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p279/p279_179|I drove the ball well.
p279/p279_040|President Bush is at war.
p279/p279_185|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p279/p279_218|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p279/p279_368|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p279/p279_123|We work on the same level.
p279/p279_387|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p279/p279_304|This is a war over our home.
p279/p279_127|I'm so angry.
p279/p279_160|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p279/p279_276|They seem to get away with it.
p279/p279_072|Scotland had great assets.
p279/p279_061|Here's a clue.
p279/p279_298|What has altered?
p279/p279_056|As she explains.
p279/p279_142|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p279/p279_263|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p279/p279_253|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p279/p279_395|So I did.
p279/p279_126|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p279/p279_352|We are looking for perfection.
p279/p279_048|It is urgent.
p279/p279_208|There was no rescue.
p279/p279_195|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p279/p279_405|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p279/p279_346|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p279/p279_327|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p279/p279_338|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p279/p279_175|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p279/p279_243|He will go a long way.
p279/p279_373|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p279/p279_290|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p279/p279_135|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p279/p279_140|This represents a tough game for us.
p279/p279_401|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p279/p279_109|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p279/p279_279|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p279/p279_399|I have been in good form for the last two years.
p279/p279_278|It happens from time to time.
p279/p279_282|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p279/p279_176|It is not either national standards or local control.
p279/p279_393|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p279/p279_031|There's a story, too.
p279/p279_258|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p279/p279_130|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p279/p279_091|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p279/p279_337|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p279/p279_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p279/p279_390|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p279/p279_052|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p279/p279_177|The clarity is vital.
p279/p279_251|This is the culture change in medicine.
p279/p279_181|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p279/p279_076|The end result is precisely the same.
p279/p279_398|You make the choice.
p279/p279_274|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p279/p279_317|My body is clearly capable.
p279/p279_267|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p279/p279_099|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p279/p279_331|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p279/p279_145|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p279/p279_070|They're appalled by that.
p279/p279_044|It will come all right.
p279/p279_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p279/p279_364|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p279/p279_340|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p279/p279_100|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p279/p279_356|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p279/p279_141|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p279/p279_236|They should come forward.
p279/p279_334|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p279/p279_137|You've got to be vigilant.
p279/p279_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p279/p279_252|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p279/p279_038|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p279/p279_119|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p279/p279_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p279/p279_347|It is horrible.
p279/p279_025|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p279/p279_036|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p279/p279_034|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p279/p279_336|The composer will conduct.
p279/p279_296|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p279/p279_369|He has the edge.
p279/p279_283|You've got to have both sides.
p279/p279_159|It is an attitude of mind.
p279/p279_028|They should be so lucky.
p279/p279_389|It will take place in July.
p279/p279_163|I have got a wife to feed.
p279/p279_073|He was popular.
p279/p279_272|That could be in place by next year.
p279/p279_152|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p279/p279_227|It is a gamble.
p279/p279_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p279/p279_075|It is like a river running by my home.
p279/p279_053|It's a blessing.
p279/p279_134|It will be too hot.
p279/p279_257|This is a big club.
p279/p279_027|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p279/p279_384|I can lead by example.
p279/p279_204|He had suffered a heart attack.
p279/p279_354|It's that sort of night.
p279/p279_089|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p279/p279_042|I was scared.
p279/p279_370|Again, we were lucky.
p279/p279_071|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p279/p279_256|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p279/p279_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p279/p279_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p279/p279_167|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p279/p279_083|She died in hospital two hours later.
p279/p279_322|He got the same story.
p279/p279_359|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p279/p279_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p279/p279_310|The letters are going out today.
p279/p279_220|His death was a tragic accident.
p279/p279_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p279/p279_132|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p279/p279_033|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p279/p279_101|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p279/p279_362|So there, we won.
p279/p279_147|I am just trying to do my job.
p279/p279_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p279/p279_242|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p279/p279_241|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p279/p279_060|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p279/p279_043|Dancing was her life.
p279/p279_341|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p279/p279_118|Does this mean.
p279/p279_365|There is no signature.
p279/p279_154|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p279/p279_054|But it might have done.
p279/p279_388|I was in jail for five years.
p279/p279_045|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p279/p279_112|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p279/p279_122|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p279/p279_166|It is not too late to get on board.
p279/p279_066|That's the truth.
p279/p279_244|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p279/p279_157|I am very happy with life.
p279/p279_110|I don't have many friends.
p279/p279_350|He has seen the past.
p279/p279_074|Have a look at our accounts.
p279/p279_286|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p279/p279_367|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p279/p279_382|It's like a basketball.
p279/p279_217|By hard work, is the answer.
p279/p279_082|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p279/p279_049|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p279/p279_345|The salary changes are long overdue.
p279/p279_080|I've been there.
p279/p279_205|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p279/p279_148|They did very well.
p279/p279_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p279/p279_330|He did a good job.
p279/p279_397|Not because they want to sing about something.
p279/p279_250|This year I understood.
p279/p279_067|They were too hard.
p279/p279_193|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p279/p279_229|At the time, he was a living legend.
p279/p279_223|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p279/p279_209|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p279/p279_386|He is on the wrong side.
p279/p279_329|They haven't got a hope.
p279/p279_194|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p279/p279_129|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p279/p279_379|I'm pleased about one thing.
p279/p279_146|It is like a football team.
p279/p279_115|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p279/p279_380|We try to keep it right.
p279/p279_219|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p279/p279_225|I am immensely sad.
p279/p279_332|It is so unfair.
p279/p279_202|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p279/p279_030|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p279/p279_294|These figures are truly awful.
p279/p279_313|Special measures were needed.
p279/p279_203|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p279/p279_107|Before the game we went for a pint.
p279/p279_158|These days are long gone.
p279/p279_228|My neighbours are horrified.
p279/p279_325|She did not attend the courtroom.
p279/p279_143|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p279/p279_224|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p279/p279_231|They are the innocent victims.
p279/p279_026|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p279/p279_240|It's too much work.
p279/p279_339|The boat was fantastic.
p279/p279_199|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p279/p279_211|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p279/p279_032|People love to see this stuff.
p279/p279_360|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p279/p279_226|I'd never seen a play about me.
p279/p279_247|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p279/p279_307|It was entirely justified.
p279/p279_300|I thought it was my only chance.
p279/p279_065|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p279/p279_371|He denied the charge.
p279/p279_150|In each case they were a goal down.
p279/p279_273|Things can change.
p279/p279_206|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p279/p279_121|Who would have?
p279/p279_232|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p279/p279_051|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p279/p279_292|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p279/p279_375|YOU thought it was a headache.
p279/p279_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p279/p279_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p279/p279_213|The road was closed for several hours.
p279/p279_287|Who will perform?
p279/p279_116|This film will be totally awesome.
p279/p279_156|This latter point is hugely important.
p279/p279_139|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p279/p279_207|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p279/p279_105|That would be unlawful.
p279/p279_081|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p279/p279_222|He's a nice guy.
p279/p279_381|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p279/p279_178|The hotel was now for sale.
p279/p279_248|He's a lovely young man.
p279/p279_266|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p279/p279_254|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p279/p279_265|It looks as though he will be right.
p279/p279_064|We have not given up hope.
p279/p279_323|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p279/p279_173|Is Saddam a threat?
p279/p279_333|It will be very, very tight.
p279/p279_260|People should not become complacent.
p279/p279_106|I didn't play well last year.
p279/p279_335|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p279/p279_315|They were fantastic.
p279/p279_079|He had been a singer.
p279/p279_046|We will push.
p279/p279_103|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p279/p279_212|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p279/p279_385|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p279/p279_262|The warning is timely.
p279/p279_214|That is an important part of our role.
p279/p279_348|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p279/p279_321|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p279/p279_059|Life is good.
p279/p279_299|Graeme was prepared.
p279/p279_372|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p279/p279_306|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p279/p279_138|It's perfectly feasible.
p279/p279_162|As, indeed, they would be.
p279/p279_295|He should have won.
p279/p279_391|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p279/p279_180|That has been the easy part.
p279/p279_084|Is there a new way forward?
p279/p279_200|I have a cold.
p279/p279_281|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p279/p279_355|He could make it.
p279/p279_161|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p279/p279_269|It left me with a sadness.
p279/p279_196|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p279/p279_233|Broke the birdie record.
p279/p279_357|I lost my head.
p279/p279_172|His team management was protective.
p279/p279_309|It's certainly different.
p279/p279_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p279/p279_097|Until you hit the big games.
p279/p279_284|The attacker died in the crash.
p279/p279_268|It's very nice.
p279/p279_216|I am delighted for Simon.
p279/p279_198|Our strategy is straightforward.
p279/p279_088|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p279/p279_058|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p279/p279_183|Government will intervene.
p279/p279_191|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p279/p279_311|I did not name it.
p279/p279_246|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p279/p279_394|He's already made history.
p279/p279_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p279/p279_403|The weekly average was three hours.
p279/p279_289|It was hopeless.
p279/p279_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p279/p279_259|they fail to engage.
p279/p279_111|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p279/p279_184|We knew nothing about it.
p279/p279_319|The airport was even different.
p279/p279_402|What would be the point?
p279/p279_108|They will want to perform well.
p279/p279_342|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p279/p279_221|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p279/p279_320|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p279/p279_400|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p279/p279_277|She looked so young.
p279/p279_280|They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
p279/p279_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p279/p279_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p279/p279_078|Painful, but only because it's true.
p279/p279_055|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p279/p279_189|It just came into my head that day.
p279/p279_235|It is set in Paris.
p279/p279_230|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p279/p279_361|Well, the big day has arrived.
p279/p279_301|One was a lawyer.
p279/p279_303|They are wrong.
p340/p340_378|What's in a name?
p340/p340_295|It shows the right amount of progress.
p340/p340_036|Who was that?
p340/p340_390|It is a challenge for all of us.
p340/p340_141|He was shaking like a leaf.
p340/p340_072|However, that is just for starters.
p340/p340_262|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p340/p340_029|But it's not just about that.
p340/p340_087|But we never wanted to do that here.
p340/p340_145|He will have to live with his words.
p340/p340_308|She died a few days later.
p340/p340_372|I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
p340/p340_043|We can hardly talk about it.
p340/p340_406|It is the end of an era.
p340/p340_168|They did a very good job.
p340/p340_338|Let's not take too much for granted.
p340/p340_176|It should be scrapped.
p340/p340_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p340/p340_353|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p340/p340_294|We are not collecting.
p340/p340_273|I am delighted for them.
p340/p340_349|The improvement today was fantastic.
p340/p340_027|We've just decided to do something about it.
p340/p340_370|It is a tragedy for the area.
p340/p340_086|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p340/p340_134|That was one very hard game.
p340/p340_225|You have to keep it on the fairways.
p340/p340_066|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p340/p340_180|Are you the man from The Herald?
p340/p340_358|The time was right.
p340/p340_260|They were his words.
p340/p340_363|Governments will have to respond.
p340/p340_339|It has been an extremely long haul.
p340/p340_336|I think we have got the balance right.
p340/p340_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p340/p340_415|There are two interests in this woodland.
p340/p340_245|I should think so, too.
p340/p340_112|Are there any he wants to play?
p340/p340_327|Is that what it's about?
p340/p340_210|I had just taken it off.
p340/p340_270|I hope he comes back.
p340/p340_329|They worked on it for three hours.
p340/p340_192|It works, as well.
p340/p340_166|It was very exciting.
p340/p340_395|It wasn't the second one.
p340/p340_373|War is not the action.
p340/p340_291|What will happen to them now?
p340/p340_073|This can be extreme.
p340/p340_193|I can't say anything.
p340/p340_165|He was very fit.
p340/p340_380|They are expected to be released today.
p340/p340_126|We are in the end game.
p340/p340_318|They have not changed at all.
p340/p340_120|The king is delighted by the honour.
p340/p340_107|That was my first reaction.
p340/p340_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p340/p340_227|So there, we won.
p340/p340_149|And he listens to his artists as well.
p340/p340_243|We just did not want to believe it.
p340/p340_418|Are you watching Liverpool?
p340/p340_303|I've heard it all before.
p340/p340_052|These people are not big names.
p340/p340_154|I've never regretted my decision.
p340/p340_398|Detectives are still working on the case.
p340/p340_368|Things are on track.
p340/p340_092|This is a terrible tragedy.
p340/p340_064|That, however, was the exception.
p340/p340_143|It looks like a hit.
p340/p340_110|That's the way it goes.
p340/p340_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p340/p340_169|It has been a waste of time.
p340/p340_137|This research is extremely promising.
p340/p340_103|He almost admitted as much.
p340/p340_053|Don't you believe it.
p340/p340_148|They are working very well.
p340/p340_231|They have already done that.
p340/p340_147|It added to the spectacle.
p340/p340_204|Why does he do it?
p340/p340_264|We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
p340/p340_142|I have a moral dilemma.
p340/p340_307|Now they had it.
p340/p340_186|I want to be frank.
p340/p340_259|The game will be at a football stadium.
p340/p340_268|Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
p340/p340_236|Her heart was not in it.
p340/p340_277|I've done it all.
p340/p340_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p340/p340_387|I didn't see it.
p340/p340_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p340/p340_174|But he was a really nice man.
p340/p340_405|He said no survivors had been found.
p340/p340_034|Do you think they would do any better?
p340/p340_163|What then is wrong?
p340/p340_413|The power of religion is so strong.
p340/p340_424|Things were not easy from the outset.
p340/p340_263|People were very confused.
p340/p340_207|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p340/p340_057|It needs a rethink.
p340/p340_320|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p340/p340_343|Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
p340/p340_376|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p340/p340_408|My daughter was really, really innocent.
p340/p340_037|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p340/p340_060|He played really, really well.
p340/p340_362|He said nothing of the sort.
p340/p340_127|This is not the case.
p340/p340_288|We could have had no new money.
p340/p340_194|I would be interested in another attempt.
p340/p340_061|He was right of course.
p340/p340_182|I came here this week to work.
p340/p340_321|Structural changes will never be enough.
p340/p340_261|Shelter also supports the reform.
p340/p340_234|They didn't find any substance.
p340/p340_410|Once again, he refused.
p340/p340_046|It would be another reason to live.
p340/p340_211|The family baton is handed on.
p340/p340_200|This is your life.
p340/p340_067|It's probably just as well.
p340/p340_167|It is clear that change is required.
p340/p340_375|It has been a frustrating one.
p340/p340_364|It simply doesn't happen.
p340/p340_241|Government funding is not a problem.
p340/p340_269|That, though, is not true.
p340/p340_077|Two options are being proposed.
p340/p340_177|It gives us hope.
p340/p340_183|We are really good friends.
p340/p340_314|I have still to hear about that.
p340/p340_093|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p340/p340_248|Can they be serious?
p340/p340_404|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
p340/p340_017|Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
p340/p340_208|We lost out a little bit.
p340/p340_224|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p340/p340_040|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p340/p340_313|You have to feel for the guy.
p340/p340_400|They were not defeated.
p340/p340_075|Would she remember the music?
p340/p340_140|Don't hold your breath.
p340/p340_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p340/p340_292|It is set in Paris.
p340/p340_396|He got his degree.
p340/p340_319|One is investment, one is reform.
p340/p340_304|We are not there yet.
p340/p340_144|How did he know?
p340/p340_160|Surely it can't get any worse.
p340/p340_298|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p340/p340_054|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p340/p340_045|I have lost all confidence.
p340/p340_286|I have spoken to my brother.
p340/p340_068|It is time for the talking to stop.
p340/p340_105|We believe it to be completely without merit.
p340/p340_283|Such as it is.
p340/p340_420|It was one New Year.
p340/p340_198|This is a disaster for us.
p340/p340_317|They want that school.
p340/p340_199|What does that mean?
p340/p340_312|But it is historic.
p340/p340_032|But someone has to take them.
p340/p340_377|But we wouldn't want them any other way.
p340/p340_025|It would be nice.
p340/p340_117|We have got to the top.
p340/p340_146|Openness is always the best way.
p340/p340_265|I am very relieved.
p340/p340_351|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p340/p340_311|That is why we are here.
p340/p340_181|And that's it?
p340/p340_296|I thought the dancing was over.
p340/p340_138|I was invited to work in Germany.
p340/p340_342|They should have listened to me.
p340/p340_278|We have worked well with them for years.
p340/p340_131|It is a strong case.
p340/p340_074|I'm sure that they will learn.
p340/p340_341|She is deeply distressed.
p340/p340_274|The second half was a different affair.
p340/p340_081|There was a vacuum.
p340/p340_124|She was not hard done by.
p340/p340_100|Or did it?
p340/p340_381|There was no question of him not impressing.
p340/p340_237|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p340/p340_157|So we started building a home.
p340/p340_106|He didn't bother a soul.
p340/p340_386|It will be a new experience.
p340/p340_412|And Scotland is no different.
p340/p340_125|They said they were only young men.
p340/p340_102|His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
p340/p340_252|They set up to win the hole.
p340/p340_216|Everything happened so quickly.
p340/p340_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p340/p340_006|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p340/p340_340|I'll need to discuss it with my family.
p340/p340_397|And rugby fans can help.
p340/p340_352|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p340/p340_322|I am extremely cautious.
p340/p340_229|I really didn't think he would.
p340/p340_056|Where is the money coming from?
p340/p340_132|Who do you think will win?
p340/p340_076|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p340/p340_203|He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
p340/p340_094|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
p340/p340_026|We are not prepared to do that.
p340/p340_222|We have no further comment to make.
p340/p340_350|He has been under great pressure.
p340/p340_065|This has been a long process.
p340/p340_249|We've got to get this right.
p340/p340_133|I certainly would not accept this decision.
p340/p340_162|He, too, will return.
p340/p340_123|Yes, we can beat them.
p340/p340_388|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p340/p340_118|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p340/p340_212|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p340/p340_272|That was our mission.
p340/p340_088|There was no hint of scandal.
p340/p340_050|But it was no problem.
p340/p340_301|There is a lot of fear.
p340/p340_419|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p340/p340_150|He is advised that he has done so.
p340/p340_213|It was properly reported to us.
p340/p340_348|I am an innocent man.
p340/p340_079|He is now back in Britain.
p340/p340_369|Frankly it was disgusting.
p340/p340_347|It was like someone had died.
p340/p340_281|One thing is clear.
p340/p340_221|He was also a great man.
p340/p340_069|We were very close.
p340/p340_344|They said they would.
p340/p340_279|They've had a good start as well.
p340/p340_383|I hadn't had that before.
p340/p340_334|Would that be for men and women?
p340/p340_178|We can't determine that clearly.
p340/p340_196|There is no other way.
p340/p340_421|We made a world record together.
p340/p340_116|I have done ever since it was published.
p340/p340_031|He was very close.
p340/p340_391|The children are fine.
p340/p340_300|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p340/p340_247|They deserved to beat us in the replay.
p340/p340_284|The car was just there.
p340/p340_310|The difference was amazing.
p340/p340_366|The past is history, not destiny.
p340/p340_184|But that is not an issue for now.
p340/p340_063|Together, we can make a difference.
p340/p340_233|So it should be.
p340/p340_082|It is time to be realistic.
p340/p340_324|Will they fall in love?
p340/p340_155|This is a recipe for disaster.
p340/p340_309|What is their concern?
p340/p340_337|It was a very terrible thing.
p340/p340_240|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p340/p340_058|Why does it work?
p340/p340_084|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p340/p340_315|I'm going to win the next two.
p340/p340_070|If only it were so.
p340/p340_109|Another man said, It was horrible.
p340/p340_173|And did they have sex?
p340/p340_170|As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
p340/p340_205|That's my daughter acting.
p340/p340_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p340/p340_151|Annika is very, very fit.
p340/p340_299|He's already made history.
p340/p340_401|There was much to be positive about.
p340/p340_422|Our policy is already working well.
p340/p340_371|He was not entirely correct.
p340/p340_051|This has been a difficult time for me.
p340/p340_230|He may have a long wait.
p340/p340_242|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p340/p340_114|It was a question of patience.
p340/p340_359|It all happened so quickly.
p340/p340_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p340/p340_164|My brother is not like that.
p340/p340_189|Yet it seemed to work.
p340/p340_416|I was frustrated here.
p340/p340_159|It will not happen overnight.
p340/p340_030|We've not won anything yet.
p340/p340_235|It's hard to say.
p340/p340_393|There's also the point.
p340/p340_071|They do not deliver.
p340/p340_062|It's there for people to look at.
p340/p340_097|You will never get a conviction.
p340/p340_128|There may be some resistance.
p340/p340_195|However, that is a sizeable if.
p340/p340_417|It is a good result.
p340/p340_190|I think it was just a tragic accident.
p340/p340_098|He did not have to stop and think.
p340/p340_389|IT had to happen.
p340/p340_115|I have never been in anything like that.
p340/p340_153|It really is tremendous.
p340/p340_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p340/p340_365|We wanted to do something different.
p340/p340_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p340/p340_289|It wasn't an easy decision.
p340/p340_331|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p340/p340_355|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p340/p340_161|He has to learn.
p340/p340_361|They really want to do it.
p340/p340_059|He would have been wrong.
p340/p340_096|It is a matter of clarity.
p340/p340_256|It was quite simply, delicious.
p340/p340_049|It is somewhere to be.
p340/p340_287|And that is very good indeed.
p340/p340_297|I think they have got it completely right.
p340/p340_113|The film is on a tightrope.
p340/p340_285|They were very unfair to him.
p340/p340_392|I don't believe in God.
p340/p340_333|It seemed so personal.
p340/p340_220|Not so, it seems.
p340/p340_253|I am not a liar.
p340/p340_251|I'm just enjoying every match.
p340/p340_403|I had a ball today.
p340/p340_044|That was a month ago.
p340/p340_187|This was an option from the beginning.
p340/p340_257|I can't believe it happened.
p340/p340_382|We were all afraid.
p340/p340_101|It's just not funny!
p340/p340_228|I don't like to fail.
p340/p340_402|It wants them to go home.
p340/p340_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p340/p340_346|You know the score.
p340/p340_267|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p340/p340_175|It was very close.
p340/p340_219|Everyone here is heartbroken.
p340/p340_201|He has seen the past.
p340/p340_035|They were appalling, disgraceful.
p340/p340_385|That is to miss the point.
p340/p340_367|I love it here.
p340/p340_407|We shall not do that.
p340/p340_136|I recommend a tour.
p340/p340_290|It wasn't really like that at all.
p340/p340_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p340/p340_325|There was nothing sinister in that.
p340/p340_411|And it will be a challenge.
p340/p340_332|People are using it in their daily lives.
p340/p340_083|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p340/p340_091|It could be to do with the location.
p340/p340_305|We will not give up on the truth.
p340/p340_423|I believe we have a good chance.
p340/p340_090|He said, we're delighted by the vote.
p340/p340_041|We didn't deserve to win.
p340/p340_238|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p340/p340_326|But don't just take my word for it.
p340/p340_039|It is a recipe for success.
p340/p340_042|This is great news.
p340/p340_399|I reported it but nothing was done.
p340/p340_028|It's a horrific incident.
p340/p340_185|Of course the ending was fantastic.
p340/p340_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p340/p340_055|We did something about it.
p340/p340_330|Let's make him a show.
p340/p340_354|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p340/p340_266|The people have been really friendly.
p340/p340_038|This is my personal assessment.
p340/p340_129|It is the same old story.
p340/p340_156|The wind was coming from all directions.
p340/p340_104|So what is the problem?
p340/p340_275|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p340/p340_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p340/p340_226|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p340/p340_250|The film was great.
p340/p340_172|It is no more than a shell.
p340/p340_244|The medal itself is not that important.
p340/p340_130|You need that freedom in society.
p340/p340_384|We have a plan in place.
p340/p340_394|It's good to be back.
p340/p340_302|They are not left wing.
p340/p340_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p340/p340_282|We might never see him again.
p340/p340_179|They are just trying to cover up.
p340/p340_191|We haven't been able to go and see.
p340/p340_135|He said something in his work.
p340/p340_232|Later, a very different story emerged.
p340/p340_345|When will this change?
p340/p340_306|Sub Not Used, McCall.
p340/p340_239|They are now collapsing.
p340/p340_357|So he was anxious to try something new.
p340/p340_214|He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
p340/p340_206|They are very clever and very dangerous.
p340/p340_316|You know it was good fun.
p340/p340_223|This produces exactly the opposite effect.
p340/p340_276|They might be surprised by the response.
p340/p340_246|The time for change is now.
p340/p340_280|The director's a genius.
p340/p340_033|We don't find any danger from them.
p340/p340_356|But he did not appear.
p340/p340_085|It is a potential danger.
p340/p340_001|Please call Stella.
p340/p340_139|Weather conditions were good, he added.
p340/p340_078|Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
p340/p340_335|The government agreed to pay.
p340/p340_328|And the audience is a surprise.
p340/p340_080|There was no commission.
p340/p340_121|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p340/p340_323|That was always the danger.
p340/p340_202|He can be beaten.
p340/p340_048|None of the pieces was commissioned.
p340/p340_119|And it worked, so we kept it.
p340/p340_218|I am feeling a bit better.
p340/p340_215|The seller was not revealed.
p340/p340_095|He said he never saw it.
p340/p340_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p340/p340_374|There are not enough of them.
p340/p340_111|But we still don't know.
p340/p340_379|It feels like a winner already.
p340/p340_271|They made up for it on Saturday.
p340/p340_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p340/p340_217|How can this be?
p340/p340_099|We deserved to win it.
p340/p340_152|This is not quite right.
p340/p340_409|It will not be easy.
p340/p340_158|He was as good as his word.
p340/p340_197|This was all well and good.
p340/p340_209|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p340/p340_360|It is working well.
p340/p340_414|It means a huge amount.
p340/p340_293|The Dream is as hard as they come.
p340/p340_188|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p340/p340_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p340/p340_122|My body is clearly capable.
p340/p340_254|Let's make this clear.
p340/p340_089|The money will go straight to the headteacher.
p340/p340_047|I felt under a lot of pressure.
p340/p340_108|Fishing is a declining industry.
p340/p340_255|We also hope to meet the men.
p340/p340_258|Thankfully it was cleared up.
p340/p340_171|He had no previous convictions.
p244/p244_262|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p244/p244_309|But it is a similar problem.
p244/p244_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p244/p244_064|We felt it was sufficient.
p244/p244_134|Three days later, he was killed.
p244/p244_257|It was really good in the first week.
p244/p244_359|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p244/p244_391|Does it matter?
p244/p244_284|It is important that he is involved.
p244/p244_070|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p244/p244_416|There is no need to panic.
p244/p244_252|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p244/p244_355|This latter suggestion is very important.
p244/p244_354|Of course, it does not have to be this way.
p244/p244_184|It should never have happened.
p244/p244_375|It is almost certain to be the last.
p244/p244_116|In the end we have to take a stand.
p244/p244_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p244/p244_115|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p244/p244_395|One-third of the places are already taken.
p244/p244_175|All the pressure was on him.
p244/p244_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p244/p244_312|In that moment, I was happy.
p244/p244_118|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p244/p244_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p244/p244_224|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p244/p244_132|It is hard to believe.
p244/p244_222|He was not injured in the attack.
p244/p244_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p244/p244_249|Did he trip?
p244/p244_383|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p244/p244_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p244/p244_147|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p244/p244_236|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p244/p244_089|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p244/p244_080|How are you, sir?
p244/p244_165|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p244/p244_099|By then, he was walking on water.
p244/p244_263|The performance continues to improve.
p244/p244_417|It had been on the cards.
p244/p244_422|I am delighted for them.
p244/p244_319|Look at the potential of this club.
p244/p244_363|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p244/p244_054|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p244/p244_074|Only water is currently allowed.
p244/p244_135|Football is a passion for many.
p244/p244_060|We have got to deliver.
p244/p244_131|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p244/p244_182|It was by the numbers.
p244/p244_087|It would have been around the turn of the century.
p244/p244_148|I am the manager of Scotland.
p244/p244_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p244/p244_240|This is a fight to the death.
p244/p244_282|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p244/p244_351|He is a great prospect.
p244/p244_109|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p244/p244_077|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p244/p244_330|And we can do it.
p244/p244_279|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p244/p244_275|He was good, but not that good.
p244/p244_061|That was the difference today.
p244/p244_414|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p244/p244_041|In London today, it was business as usual.
p244/p244_145|Actors like to be in the centre.
p244/p244_421|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p244/p244_214|This conference was never confirmed.
p244/p244_217|I'm interested in interesting work.
p244/p244_278|However, the matter is not going to end there.
p244/p244_103|The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
p244/p244_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p244/p244_183|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p244/p244_073|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p244/p244_130|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p244/p244_418|However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
p244/p244_216|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p244/p244_301|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p244/p244_208|It was the story of the second half.
p244/p244_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p244/p244_324|However, the devil is in the detail.
p244/p244_328|Another difference is the cost.
p244/p244_349|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p244/p244_277|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p244/p244_265|However, no further action was taken by police.
p244/p244_035|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p244/p244_193|Was it the wife?
p244/p244_267|But we were in control at that point.
p244/p244_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p244/p244_250|Sadly, it could not be done.
p244/p244_153|Others are expected to follow the lead.
p244/p244_317|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p244/p244_364|However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
p244/p244_138|So what is the campaign about?
p244/p244_167|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p244/p244_120|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p244/p244_180|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p244/p244_398|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p244/p244_219|THE force is with them.
p244/p244_244|And they were being paid?
p244/p244_411|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p244/p244_179|I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
p244/p244_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p244/p244_268|It has to be enforced.
p244/p244_298|What form did that take?
p244/p244_040|She was at the top.
p244/p244_296|Is our children learning?
p244/p244_062|The company continues to grow.
p244/p244_253|Instead, he missed the lot.
p244/p244_306|It will be done in stages.
p244/p244_095|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p244/p244_346|The banking sector was weak.
p244/p244_230|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p244/p244_110|Then again, we could have.
p244/p244_381|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p244/p244_371|I have a good feeling about this.
p244/p244_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p244/p244_308|Every character was completely different.
p244/p244_368|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p244/p244_195|What do we want to do that for?
p244/p244_211|He is believed to live in Britain.
p244/p244_050|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p244/p244_123|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p244/p244_334|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p244/p244_200|He has defended the system.
p244/p244_407|It's great that it happened in Britain.
p244/p244_232|Other villages were completely deserted.
p244/p244_342|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p244/p244_297|How independent is that?
p244/p244_393|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p244/p244_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p244/p244_141|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p244/p244_188|That is a question for the next manager.
p244/p244_096|He is in the US.
p244/p244_159|If not, a deal could take many months.
p244/p244_396|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p244/p244_160|We want to get there.
p244/p244_198|I would like to continue to develop.
p244/p244_350|This isn't the end of story.
p244/p244_376|You have to be patient.
p244/p244_307|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p244/p244_387|He will be difficult to replace.
p244/p244_313|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p244/p244_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p244/p244_121|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p244/p244_170|We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
p244/p244_258|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p244/p244_314|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p244/p244_156|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p244/p244_394|After the match, do you?
p244/p244_234|It will be decided in the next month.
p244/p244_231|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p244/p244_357|They were impressive against France.
p244/p244_321|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p244/p244_336|It is a sensitive issue.
p244/p244_331|What are they for?
p244/p244_358|The challenge is to win a cup.
p244/p244_274|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p244/p244_046|It is all about the story.
p244/p244_092|It sounds a lot of money.
p244/p244_204|It is not an issue.
p244/p244_290|I should think so, too.
p244/p244_419|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p244/p244_347|But the New Year was special.
p244/p244_048|In fact, they are the future of investment.
p244/p244_288|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p244/p244_052|The pressure on the players will build.
p244/p244_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p244/p244_107|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p244/p244_220|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p244/p244_367|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p244/p244_320|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p244/p244_172|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p244/p244_402|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p244/p244_068|He has not been dropped.
p244/p244_228|We want this place to work.
p244/p244_380|We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
p244/p244_251|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p244/p244_237|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p244/p244_063|He said it was for sale.
p244/p244_348|We never played at all.
p244/p244_379|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p244/p244_291|None of the agencies was able to help.
p244/p244_248|Is it in the right place?
p244/p244_090|It seems a good thing to try.
p244/p244_098|It took an option on the process.
p244/p244_406|There is a demand for it.
p244/p244_133|Or it would have been.
p244/p244_203|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p244/p244_209|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p244/p244_122|He was not alone at the top of the board.
p244/p244_082|Do I have a favourite?
p244/p244_078|That will be the office.
p244/p244_361|Either team will be hard.
p244/p244_025|We are a service industry.
p244/p244_311|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p244/p244_106|Victory was never in doubt.
p244/p244_187|It is difficult to say.
p244/p244_164|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p244/p244_400|It is the last meeting of the season.
p244/p244_157|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p244/p244_254|I was never in danger.
p244/p244_205|They have to get that sorted.
p244/p244_388|I would be interested in another attempt.
p244/p244_117|This is a sea change in approach.
p244/p244_264|It expected this trend to continue.
p244/p244_283|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p244/p244_424|But it was a struggle.
p244/p244_410|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p244/p244_168|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p244/p244_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p244/p244_127|According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p244/p244_128|It was far from business as usual.
p244/p244_031|They were in good humour, too.
p244/p244_246|What was the matter for concern?
p244/p244_404|The service is expected to be introduced in December.
p244/p244_413|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p244/p244_102|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p244/p244_344|And the context is also completely different.
p244/p244_150|There were no grounds for his action.
p244/p244_139|And does it?
p244/p244_056|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p244/p244_072|It is only the beginning.
p244/p244_255|A lot has been written.
p244/p244_196|Does the name matter?
p244/p244_076|She did that for the rest of her life.
p244/p244_186|The feeling is hard to describe.
p244/p244_271|But the government has so far failed to listen.
p244/p244_045|They are going after them.
p244/p244_397|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p244/p244_086|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p244/p244_144|I have been in contact with him.
p244/p244_049|That is still the case.
p244/p244_221|It was important to win today.
p244/p244_365|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p244/p244_140|Are you from the rugby?
p244/p244_058|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p244/p244_033|It is on the internet.
p244/p244_327|He is already in place.
p244/p244_027|We want to lift the cup for the fans.
p244/p244_185|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p244/p244_083|What do we do?
p244/p244_055|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p244/p244_026|It may be good for the soul.
p244/p244_270|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p244/p244_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p244/p244_318|We have to be very, very careful.
p244/p244_260|That is not the case in Europe.
p244/p244_384|The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
p244/p244_360|It was a test in itself.
p244/p244_408|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p244/p244_119|The procedures were not in place.
p244/p244_335|And it's a goodbye from him.
p244/p244_071|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p244/p244_362|The parents will have a great time, too.
p244/p244_243|The matter is under appeal.
p244/p244_340|The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
p244/p244_207|He played it like a veteran.
p244/p244_423|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p244/p244_149|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p244/p244_093|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p244/p244_051|In my view, it has to be done.
p244/p244_085|It starts with the script.
p244/p244_303|We have to be realistic.
p244/p244_038|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p244/p244_112|But he has not become a monster.
p244/p244_189|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p244/p244_181|I was always in control.
p244/p244_378|I was delighted to accept.
p244/p244_154|She does not want to speak.
p244/p244_039|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p244/p244_305|There was a hole in it.
p244/p244_287|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p244/p244_261|But it was a loss.
p244/p244_176|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p244/p244_125|We had a great time.
p244/p244_113|He is not a dancer.
p244/p244_029|It is about investing in the future.
p244/p244_225|Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
p244/p244_273|I am still waiting for a reply.
p244/p244_163|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p244/p244_114|We had planned to sell the property for some time.
p244/p244_373|Some of the passing was a disgrace.
p244/p244_333|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p244/p244_191|It is simply not true.
p244/p244_372|The news is not all bad.
p244/p244_067|But that's another story for another day.
p244/p244_389|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p244/p244_310|In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
p244/p244_229|It still has an effect.
p244/p244_081|So is that it, then?
p244/p244_300|Scotland won by six wickets.
p244/p244_166|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p244/p244_194|Why change it?
p244/p244_390|He was on a mission.
p244/p244_136|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p244/p244_053|Their campaign is in disarray.
p244/p244_066|There is a lot to be done.
p244/p244_059|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p244/p244_341|However, a bid was never made.
p244/p244_094|It is not a story.
p244/p244_370|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p244/p244_155|It was all for good reason as well.
p244/p244_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p244/p244_399|I want this one to be different.
p244/p244_409|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p244/p244_142|That was the first step.
p244/p244_084|Why do it otherwise?
p244/p244_420|That might mean another delay.
p244/p244_161|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p244/p244_339|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p244/p244_001|Please call Stella.
p244/p244_215|A team is a team.
p244/p244_412|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p244/p244_353|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p244/p244_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p244/p244_047|The whole thing is the music.
p244/p244_369|However, it was well worth the wait.
p244/p244_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p244/p244_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p244/p244_304|Every one is a winner.
p244/p244_415|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p244/p244_129|He wanted to record the group.
p244/p244_218|It decided to blame the media.
p244/p244_239|There was a lot of resentment.
p244/p244_199|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p244/p244_256|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p244/p244_227|However, it is not as simple as this.
p244/p244_280|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p244/p244_075|This time, it might be for real.
p244/p244_223|Because he was born in England.
p244/p244_281|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p244/p244_032|The end result is the same.
p244/p244_105|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p244/p244_294|We are in a war.
p244/p244_337|They have to be addressed.
p244/p244_238|We have an election in eight days.
p244/p244_403|He is a quality player.
p244/p244_405|It's all been about the basics of the business.
p244/p244_201|We want to begin a programme in the UK.
p244/p244_338|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p244/p244_366|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p244/p244_152|It starts at the top.
p244/p244_079|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p244/p244_111|There, you were just a body.
p244/p244_206|We can take the city.
p244/p244_124|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p244/p244_292|I didn't see the point.
p244/p244_212|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p244/p244_377|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p244/p244_151|I can't even get into the A team.
p244/p244_174|Like the others, he was arrested.
p244/p244_325|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p244/p244_233|There is a lot of concern.
p244/p244_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p244/p244_374|However, it does not seem to be the case.
p244/p244_302|This is a historic agreement.
p244/p244_266|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p244/p244_043|Something has to be put in place.
p244/p244_322|We did something about it.
p244/p244_315|They were not at the property yesterday.
p244/p244_108|On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
p244/p244_069|It was an outstanding performance.
p244/p244_101|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p244/p244_042|And they had a case.
p244/p244_316|It involved the same people.
p244/p244_057|Clearly, they had other problems.
p244/p244_401|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p244/p244_385|Everything is in the mix.
p244/p244_100|This is a game of confidence.
p244/p244_037|History is in the making.
p244/p244_276|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p244/p244_158|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p244/p244_345|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p244/p244_169|Anyone can do the sums.
p244/p244_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p244/p244_177|They have not been named.
p244/p244_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p244/p244_065|That is all in the past.
p244/p244_285|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p244/p244_392|How do you take them away?
p244/p244_210|As many as the market will support.
p244/p244_171|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p244/p244_197|That you can do it.
p244/p244_226|I was not overly concerned about this.
p244/p244_192|Are you going to win?
p244/p244_104|The trick is to try it.
p244/p244_295|Do you think we are a top nation?
p244/p244_036|This is a central issue.
p244/p244_190|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p244/p244_382|It's fantastic to win again.
p244/p244_242|He is a man of the people.
p244/p244_269|The party has never fully recovered.
p244/p244_286|It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
p244/p244_137|So, did she meet him?
p244/p244_235|We have to win the group.
p244/p244_272|He must have a crack at it.
p244/p244_126|I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
p244/p244_044|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p244/p244_143|However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
p244/p244_213|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p244/p244_241|All will be revealed in due course.
p244/p244_088|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p244/p244_326|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p244/p244_034|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p244/p244_245|was everything done to save people?
p244/p244_178|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p244/p244_097|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p244/p244_091|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p244/p244_299|Are they free?
p244/p244_343|Something is going to have to give.
p244/p244_329|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p244/p244_356|However, it does not tell the full story.
p244/p244_352|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p244/p244_173|We were all over the place in the first half.
p244/p244_146|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p244/p244_247|Do I think about them often?
p244/p244_259|However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
p244/p244_323|But it is up again.
p244/p244_386|An announcement is expected this week.
p244/p244_293|This idea has been around for four years.
p244/p244_162|There is a lack of staff.
p347/p347_241|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p347/p347_375|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p347/p347_393|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p347/p347_253|You're not going to get hurt.
p347/p347_032|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p347/p347_062|The message is just not getting through.
p347/p347_299|They played it like a cup final.
p347/p347_332|I know nothing about that.
p347/p347_360|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p347/p347_419|They wanted to show what they could do.
p347/p347_075|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p347/p347_191|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p347/p347_182|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p347/p347_397|It is not a wish list.
p347/p347_410|It was a stunning strike.
p347/p347_416|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p347/p347_147|Too many factors are now working against him.
p347/p347_422|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p347/p347_229|It is time for a more honest approach.
p347/p347_203|But you can go beyond that condition.
p347/p347_061|This is only the start of my season.
p347/p347_211|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p347/p347_346|His name is Michael Owen.
p347/p347_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p347/p347_030|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p347/p347_366|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p347/p347_104|Safety was also an issue.
p347/p347_281|I am a committed European.
p347/p347_400|There is no margin for error.
p347/p347_223|I hope they understand that.
p347/p347_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p347/p347_390|But there's no eye contact.
p347/p347_046|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p347/p347_382|Election results are expected soon.
p347/p347_179|The same goes for personnel.
p347/p347_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p347/p347_364|I was a little surprised.
p347/p347_099|Could they perhaps be related?
p347/p347_187|I think we're very different.
p347/p347_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p347/p347_311|I think that could work to our advantage.
p347/p347_158|That's been our position all along.
p347/p347_207|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p347/p347_174|I didn't mean to kill her.
p347/p347_094|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p347/p347_320|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p347/p347_001|Please call Stella.
p347/p347_192|My ambitions are still with football.
p347/p347_306|And we were right.
p347/p347_038|We have nothing to say about that.
p347/p347_068|We were given a break.
p347/p347_359|Which he can do.
p347/p347_109|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p347/p347_398|Some of the players have not progressed.
p347/p347_073|They had not been handcuffed.
p347/p347_173|I never found my rhythm.
p347/p347_242|What's the rush?
p347/p347_025|A crucial moment has arrived.
p347/p347_233|It is a big time for me.
p347/p347_358|Smith has not let him down.
p347/p347_261|It had been in place since last July.
p347/p347_196|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p347/p347_258|I am a little bit tired.
p347/p347_067|My game is in pretty good shape.
p347/p347_132|All the people thought that we would die.
p347/p347_210|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p347/p347_368|I'm really proud of my young players.
p347/p347_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p347/p347_197|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p347/p347_323|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p347/p347_098|What's it got to do with art?
p347/p347_103|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p347/p347_071|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p347/p347_170|She could easily have been killed.
p347/p347_363|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p347/p347_076|You have to rely on each other.
p347/p347_248|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p347/p347_154|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p347/p347_415|What exactly is your job?
p347/p347_394|I took a minibus into town.
p347/p347_129|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p347/p347_370|It's an internal matter.
p347/p347_280|I could feel the blood on my face.
p347/p347_126|We are in the business of selling tickets.
p347/p347_391|There was no energy behind it.
p347/p347_309|Surely it can do better than that?
p347/p347_262|I have just got to get back.
p347/p347_273|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p347/p347_286|It is just too long since the war.
p347/p347_274|You were the kidnappers.
p347/p347_128|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p347/p347_270|The whole region is in shock.
p347/p347_237|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p347/p347_356|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p347/p347_339|You encourage them - you can do it.
p347/p347_172|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p347/p347_338|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p347/p347_424|Is this accurate?
p347/p347_259|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p347/p347_084|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p347/p347_035|His views are hardly surprising.
p347/p347_288|I mean it happens.
p347/p347_064|I've taken to the hills.
p347/p347_114|The days of empty promises are over.
p347/p347_181|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p347/p347_296|Raised the way you want it.
p347/p347_287|She didn't tell us anything new.
p347/p347_205|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p347/p347_194|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p347/p347_167|It's going to be epic.
p347/p347_033|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p347/p347_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p347/p347_298|I know you went back this morning.
p347/p347_350|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p347/p347_097|There was no option.
p347/p347_244|He's in with the furniture.
p347/p347_300|This has a number of benefits.
p347/p347_026|We still have a long, long way to go.
p347/p347_246|There is only one caveat.
p347/p347_028|There are moments of silence.
p347/p347_027|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p347/p347_334|That is as it may be.
p347/p347_055|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p347/p347_130|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p347/p347_381|This must be kept in total perspective.
p347/p347_329|There is no date on this document.
p347/p347_091|This is my life.
p347/p347_117|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p347/p347_169|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p347/p347_279|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p347/p347_295|It is typical of me.
p347/p347_195|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p347/p347_302|I think it is a great shame.
p347/p347_235|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p347/p347_072|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p347/p347_136|I don't want to come down.
p347/p347_125|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p347/p347_083|The Hague is too good for him.
p347/p347_090|It is a hangover effect.
p347/p347_228|The damage has been done.
p347/p347_325|I haven't won the world title.
p347/p347_245|Do not go into government buildings.
p347/p347_175|It is a job creation scheme.
p347/p347_193|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p347/p347_396|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p347/p347_354|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p347/p347_349|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p347/p347_314|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p347/p347_111|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p347/p347_037|And look at the leading conductors, he says.
p347/p347_232|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p347/p347_374|They were only there for three weeks.
p347/p347_143|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p347/p347_112|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p347/p347_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p347/p347_238|That is the key message.
p347/p347_202|Before the games it was pretty open.
p347/p347_380|It's not just for classical music.
p347/p347_142|I felt we needed to bring that in.
p347/p347_240|This is the subway.
p347/p347_373|We're delighted about the vote.
p347/p347_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p347/p347_222|Do not forget about Monaco.
p347/p347_249|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p347/p347_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p347/p347_414|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p347/p347_133|It is never an easy game.
p347/p347_247|We are still getting signals.
p347/p347_100|But who shot the president?
p347/p347_047|You can't give in to the vandals.
p347/p347_418|I grew up listening to these people.
p347/p347_351|So now you know.
p347/p347_322|I was doing well at the hustings.
p347/p347_264|Players want to know what is on offer.
p347/p347_178|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p347/p347_080|No-one said anything to me.
p347/p347_412|She said he showed no remorse.
p347/p347_115|Henry was strong and talented.
p347/p347_337|Eleven events are required.
p347/p347_220|It could not be too high.
p347/p347_335|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p347/p347_049|Everything was an effort.
p347/p347_243|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p347/p347_330|And now he tells us.
p347/p347_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p347/p347_282|There are no plans to change this.
p347/p347_180|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p347/p347_318|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p347/p347_190|Glasgow then took control.
p347/p347_087|This is a club on the rise.
p347/p347_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p347/p347_102|I'm looking forward to that.
p347/p347_293|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p347/p347_355|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p347/p347_388|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p347/p347_310|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p347/p347_123|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p347/p347_161|I never had a childhood.
p347/p347_119|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p347/p347_308|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p347/p347_353|It's a very special unit.
p347/p347_176|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p347/p347_277|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p347/p347_168|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p347/p347_200|It is legally binding.
p347/p347_043|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p347/p347_137|However, it's good to turn the page.
p347/p347_321|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p347/p347_108|Clark is back on top form.
p347/p347_186|I learned a lot from that.
p347/p347_118|Faces from the Eighties.
p347/p347_255|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p347/p347_386|Is that where we are?
p347/p347_183|This area is perfect for children.
p347/p347_399|They were both very brave.
p347/p347_039|We've tried every other way.
p347/p347_036|It is time for a new approach.
p347/p347_204|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p347/p347_139|He had reason to be pleased.
p347/p347_058|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p347/p347_054|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p347/p347_074|I think we will join the single currency.
p347/p347_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p347/p347_289|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p347/p347_085|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p347/p347_041|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p347/p347_408|There is great potential on this river.
p347/p347_327|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p347/p347_413|We are going through difficult times.
p347/p347_086|It's a true story.
p347/p347_162|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p347/p347_218|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p347/p347_134|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p347/p347_345|Our future was his future.
p347/p347_252|There are a few changes.
p347/p347_411|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p347/p347_290|Debbie Harry was cool.
p347/p347_152|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p347/p347_378|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p347/p347_044|It does make a big difference.
p347/p347_059|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p347/p347_082|That is in the public domain.
p347/p347_215|That was moving the goalposts.
p347/p347_166|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p347/p347_271|It was a journey into a new life.
p347/p347_376|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p347/p347_057|It will come up here.
p347/p347_283|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p347/p347_305|The chief constable is right.
p347/p347_275|It is a very interesting subject.
p347/p347_256|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p347/p347_387|We used to keep our business rates.
p347/p347_265|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p347/p347_188|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p347/p347_379|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p347/p347_160|We have not had a formal request.
p347/p347_348|He's got a great chance of making it.
p347/p347_212|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p347/p347_340|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p347/p347_171|British officials said they could not say.
p347/p347_234|There were two things going on at once.
p347/p347_285|Working with him is like working with myself.
p347/p347_303|A review of the decision is being sought.
p347/p347_156|They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
p347/p347_214|He has lost confidence and weight.
p347/p347_224|You can never tell.
p347/p347_403|I get very excited by that.
p347/p347_164|We were very much a happy family.
p347/p347_344|It is very much a matter for them.
p347/p347_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p347/p347_230|That's the National Grid.
p347/p347_217|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p347/p347_272|It will be the final push.
p347/p347_029|So now this series has had its day.
p347/p347_052|My parents are exhausted.
p347/p347_151|I just wasn't very good.
p347/p347_331|I am not changing my event.
p347/p347_107|There was nobody on the roof.
p347/p347_257|I heard some of his remarks.
p347/p347_317|The red card was okay.
p347/p347_131|YOU thought it was a headache.
p347/p347_101|We do not get that impression now.
p347/p347_150|It is simple, really.
p347/p347_291|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p347/p347_144|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p347/p347_421|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p347/p347_135|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p347/p347_409|We can't win a big game.
p347/p347_216|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p347/p347_105|That's why he visited.
p347/p347_402|It was not a foul.
p347/p347_316|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p347/p347_079|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p347/p347_127|It is just part of modern day life.
p347/p347_201|We went straight into the bedroom.
p347/p347_278|Raymond was always on the outside.
p347/p347_395|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p347/p347_153|But he is not using them.
p347/p347_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p347/p347_357|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p347/p347_367|They believed it worked.
p347/p347_384|There are moments of honesty, too.
p347/p347_120|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p347/p347_407|Which means it matters.
p347/p347_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p347/p347_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p347/p347_236|It is a cause for concern.
p347/p347_050|And does it even matter?
p347/p347_096|They don't take you to mass graves.
p347/p347_163|We offered something different.
p347/p347_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p347/p347_116|That is our unfinished business.
p347/p347_383|All of the names are familiar to me.
p347/p347_121|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p347/p347_106|I know a lot of people who don't.
p347/p347_313|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p347/p347_113|They are all Arabs.
p347/p347_417|There's nothing for you here.
p347/p347_267|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p347/p347_269|How much of a cop out is that?
p347/p347_199|It's not right of Labour.
p347/p347_078|We cannot ask for them back.
p347/p347_401|Why should we even be asked to share?
p347/p347_326|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p347/p347_070|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p347/p347_292|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p347/p347_209|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p347/p347_157|It was a breathtaking moment.
p347/p347_333|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p347/p347_225|But Annika is just amazing.
p347/p347_045|How many cases have there been?
p347/p347_145|That alibi is now gone.
p347/p347_324|This is my music.
p347/p347_405|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p347/p347_040|I'll have to go out and impress.
p347/p347_231|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p347/p347_077|One thing is certain.
p347/p347_110|It needs somebody to give way.
p347/p347_124|They will do their own thing.
p347/p347_093|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p347/p347_385|They didn't find anything.
p347/p347_251|Everyone can be bought.
p347/p347_122|You can cope with it.
p347/p347_343|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p347/p347_372|You realise what this means?
p347/p347_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p347/p347_141|That is impressive by any standards.
p347/p347_048|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p347/p347_227|She will also get a pay rise.
p347/p347_031|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p347/p347_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p347/p347_066|The crowd was awesome.
p347/p347_315|We hope this scheme will change that.
p347/p347_352|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p347/p347_213|Or some thought that they have.
p347/p347_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p347/p347_206|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p347/p347_159|I was in jail for five years.
p347/p347_362|And we're talking Big Money.
p347/p347_146|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p347/p347_185|I was chosen to do this.
p347/p347_389|I suspect that it will.
p347/p347_342|Britain is a peaceful nation.
p347/p347_208|Who can tell?
p347/p347_301|I will carry on.
p347/p347_148|Is the war over?
p347/p347_065|This is a big, big win.
p347/p347_347|It has made a difference.
p347/p347_276|Arguably, they have already done it.
p347/p347_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p347/p347_336|This is the start of a new campaign.
p347/p347_361|They were that poor.
p347/p347_184|The firm was down and almost out.
p347/p347_063|It sounded awfully like panic.
p347/p347_239|It ignores the future.
p347/p347_089|Theatre is not a museum.
p347/p347_263|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p347/p347_060|It is a very special city.
p347/p347_092|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p347/p347_304|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p347/p347_051|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p347/p347_095|We gave them the goal.
p347/p347_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p347/p347_307|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p347/p347_266|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p347/p347_319|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p347/p347_034|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p347/p347_341|I always said No.
p347/p347_404|The members have clearly spoken.
p347/p347_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p347/p347_254|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p347/p347_423|I have not come in to take over.
p347/p347_198|Our approach will be different.
p347/p347_312|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p347/p347_392|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p347/p347_284|It's in the eyes.
p347/p347_069|He already had had complaints.
p347/p347_140|It was important to win the singles.
p347/p347_056|My thoughts are with their families.
p347/p347_406|I believe in God.
p347/p347_149|You do have a way out.
p347/p347_177|We might be back next year.
p347/p347_420|I just want to get rid of it.
p347/p347_294|Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
p347/p347_250|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p347/p347_219|Two and a half million people have died.
p347/p347_268|The singer's condition was not specified.
p347/p347_221|Or so it would appear.
p347/p347_365|It was a bit like having children.
p347/p347_371|They should feel ashamed.
p347/p347_189|There was an element of jealousy.
p347/p347_328|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p347/p347_165|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p347/p347_138|I thought it was quite good.
p347/p347_155|I certainly believe we can do it.
p347/p347_053|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p347/p347_297|However, consumers may take a different view.
p347/p347_377|It is just completely erased.
p347/p347_081|All of us do.
p347/p347_088|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p347/p347_226|Our job is to change that.
p347/p347_260|I was just overwhelmed.
p347/p347_369|As it happened, it was much more than that.
p286/p286_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p286/p286_209|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p286/p286_152|What do we want to do that for?
p286/p286_249|She will attend in July.
p286/p286_402|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p286/p286_026|We must convince the citizens.
p286/p286_350|Are they free?
p286/p286_134|It was a good game to watch.
p286/p286_206|I think, therefore I am?
p286/p286_097|Had I heard?
p286/p286_419|It had been on the cards.
p286/p286_380|It's as wide as a church in here.
p286/p286_195|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p286/p286_354|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p286/p286_386|One-third of the places are already taken.
p286/p286_340|I didn't have the reply.
p286/p286_416|Three years ago he would have been.
p286/p286_089|Potions said he would drive.
p286/p286_293|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p286/p286_449|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
p286/p286_199|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p286/p286_272|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p286/p286_428|It was a breathtaking moment.
p286/p286_066|It is a great feeling right now.
p286/p286_445|There were no formal announcements.
p286/p286_353|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p286/p286_321|The songs are just so good.
p286/p286_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p286/p286_422|That was a touch of class.
p286/p286_339|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p286/p286_146|He will get his chances.
p286/p286_173|That would open the gates of hell.
p286/p286_296|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p286/p286_192|They are only interested in attacking Labour.
p286/p286_107|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p286/p286_377|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p286/p286_047|I had trouble with the producers.
p286/p286_141|My life has changed a lot.
p286/p286_045|I had come back from London.
p286/p286_443|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p286/p286_441|Everything in golf is a balance.
p286/p286_430|Nobody should believe this story.
p286/p286_435|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p286/p286_115|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p286/p286_156|He's not a Celtic man.
p286/p286_355|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p286/p286_191|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p286/p286_147|They could use a boost.
p286/p286_360|I'd like to take the plunge.
p286/p286_136|However, the problem is the timing.
p286/p286_396|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p286/p286_067|It's not covered by the insurance.
p286/p286_420|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p286/p286_223|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p286/p286_317|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p286/p286_381|She is obviously very disappointed.
p286/p286_083|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p286/p286_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p286/p286_301|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p286/p286_069|It wasn't possible to relax.
p286/p286_060|We would have concerns about suspension.
p286/p286_120|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p286/p286_104|Until you hit the big games.
p286/p286_255|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p286/p286_031|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p286/p286_357|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p286/p286_455|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p286/p286_116|In the end we made too many errors.
p286/p286_081|It's all going to clear the debt.
p286/p286_379|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p286/p286_149|Are you going to win?
p286/p286_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p286/p286_356|Whether this return was too soon.
p286/p286_305|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p286/p286_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p286/p286_431|It's going to be epic.
p286/p286_258|There were no reports of casualties.
p286/p286_202|It caused a lot of upset.
p286/p286_399|In fact, he was great today.
p286/p286_304|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p286/p286_071|Then followed a bout of flu.
p286/p286_216|This will be our new beginning.
p286/p286_028|Because we do not need it.
p286/p286_371|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p286/p286_370|You did not see it.
p286/p286_439|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p286/p286_164|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p286/p286_117|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p286/p286_087|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p286/p286_075|It is a job creation scheme.
p286/p286_298|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p286/p286_025|Smoking is also very important.
p286/p286_438|Which may be the same thing.
p286/p286_409|They were a lovely family.
p286/p286_254|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p286/p286_109|They must be on commission.
p286/p286_383|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p286/p286_369|Do not forget about Monaco.
p286/p286_288|The stage was set for a showdown.
p286/p286_434|The growth potential is enormous.
p286/p286_418|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p286/p286_294|It was an easy decision to come here.
p286/p286_093|So, did she meet him?
p286/p286_342|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p286/p286_130|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p286/p286_323|We need to increase the membership.
p286/p286_171|It's never great to finish second.
p286/p286_148|What happened in that game?
p286/p286_265|We have no information on Iraq.
p286/p286_384|The team hadn't been picked.
p286/p286_138|Which can happen any time.
p286/p286_436|But he gave no details.
p286/p286_042|He looks like an Afghan.
p286/p286_101|It really was an unusual award.
p286/p286_332|The party lasted all night.
p286/p286_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p286/p286_361|I have a moral dilemma.
p286/p286_393|How do you take them away?
p286/p286_111|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p286/p286_432|They did the right thing.
p286/p286_259|This fact is supported by audience research.
p286/p286_310|But it has been an amazing experience.
p286/p286_242|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p286/p286_261|And it was this one.
p286/p286_309|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p286/p286_207|Who was she?
p286/p286_464|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p286/p286_271|No production contract is yet in sight.
p286/p286_200|I'm interested in interesting work.
p286/p286_328|The dealer is on notice.
p286/p286_424|It was important to win the singles.
p286/p286_337|Survival is not an option.
p286/p286_256|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p286/p286_394|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p286/p286_444|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p286/p286_347|Do you think we are a top nation?
p286/p286_300|You have to expect this type of thing.
p286/p286_139|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p286/p286_084|He has been a success this year.
p286/p286_448|The couple had one daughter.
p286/p286_227|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p286/p286_400|A review is under way.
p286/p286_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p286/p286_035|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p286/p286_260|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p286/p286_324|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p286/p286_183|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p286/p286_338|The letters are going out today.
p286/p286_001|Please call Stella.
p286/p286_205|What are you not good at?
p286/p286_182|This championship is different from the other majors.
p286/p286_137|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p286/p286_425|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p286/p286_286|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p286/p286_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p286/p286_268|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p286/p286_217|They have the cash and the fire power.
p286/p286_367|I think we'll just keep it.
p286/p286_131|Then again, we could have.
p286/p286_378|Finally came the moment of truth.
p286/p286_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p286/p286_186|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p286/p286_375|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p286/p286_345|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p286/p286_213|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p286/p286_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p286/p286_058|We have not given up hope.
p286/p286_172|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p286/p286_382|It is not for any other purpose.
p286/p286_331|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
p286/p286_140|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p286/p286_122|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p286/p286_234|They are difficult awards to decide.
p286/p286_092|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p286/p286_408|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p286/p286_372|I was delighted to accept.
p286/p286_128|It isn't a happy memory.
p286/p286_267|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p286/p286_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p286/p286_072|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p286/p286_297|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p286/p286_132|They will remember this victory for a while.
p286/p286_403|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p286/p286_082|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p286/p286_032|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p286/p286_427|No date has been fixed for his return.
p286/p286_264|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p286/p286_127|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p286/p286_133|Structural changes were also required.
p286/p286_417|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p286/p286_185|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p286/p286_103|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p286/p286_123|I have learned from him.
p286/p286_179|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p286/p286_170|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p286/p286_220|The early physical reports were clear.
p286/p286_334|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p286/p286_073|That would be too easy.
p286/p286_114|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p286/p286_454|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p286/p286_368|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p286/p286_462|The peace process will be buried!
p286/p286_187|Each case is treated on merit.
p286/p286_155|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p286/p286_413|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p286/p286_144|The first half was depressing.
p286/p286_351|Is there a waiting list?
p286/p286_167|It should never have happened.
p286/p286_165|We will turn the corner.
p286/p286_044|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p286/p286_312|Our season is not finished.
p286/p286_126|Maybe this battle has been.
p286/p286_054|So is that it, then?
p286/p286_453|He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
p286/p286_211|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p286/p286_456|They were good years for him.
p286/p286_076|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p286/p286_333|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p286/p286_248|They are the innocent victims.
p286/p286_238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p286/p286_176|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p286/p286_125|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p286/p286_326|You are a different people.
p286/p286_385|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p286/p286_257|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p286/p286_106|We will deal with the refugees.
p286/p286_390|Rugby has an extended run.
p286/p286_094|So what is the campaign about?
p286/p286_166|My Dad is a hero.
p286/p286_074|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p286/p286_280|Is it in the right place?
p286/p286_292|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p286/p286_163|The family kept away from me.
p286/p286_247|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p286/p286_253|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p286/p286_270|I should think so, too.
p286/p286_228|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p286/p286_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p286/p286_287|There's not much money in cycling.
p286/p286_327|McNaughton was not so sure.
p286/p286_158|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p286/p286_414|It's just a training thing.
p286/p286_215|It was a moment of madness.
p286/p286_330|It is a road of death.
p286/p286_365|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p286/p286_352|They were impressive against France.
p286/p286_218|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p286/p286_078|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p286/p286_466|He was backed by Downing Street.
p286/p286_162|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p286/p286_344|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p286/p286_180|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p286/p286_283|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p286/p286_056|People come to see the Highlands.
p286/p286_153|At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
p286/p286_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p286/p286_412|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p286/p286_366|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p286/p286_423|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p286/p286_358|The pain is still acute.
p286/p286_391|Is it worth it?
p286/p286_150|Was it the wife?
p286/p286_219|We should all be grateful.
p286/p286_091|Why do it otherwise?
p286/p286_311|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p286/p286_233|These things have not happened by accident.
p286/p286_204|how do you get it back?
p286/p286_113|But I know the course.
p286/p286_467|It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
p286/p286_184|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p286/p286_262|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p286/p286_080|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p286/p286_320|He has taken the title for the last two years.
p286/p286_306|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p286/p286_052|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p286/p286_100|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p286/p286_129|The firm also has a construction division.
p286/p286_405|Clark is back on top form.
p286/p286_243|I have spoken to the skipper.
p286/p286_142|He said to give a local injection.
p286/p286_098|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p286/p286_374|You need a licence to run a pub.
p286/p286_189|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p286/p286_279|Do I think about them often?
p286/p286_124|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p286/p286_269|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p286/p286_178|One season, they might do well.
p286/p286_275|This idea has been around for four years.
p286/p286_276|And they were being paid?
p286/p286_404|Well, the big day has arrived.
p286/p286_118|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p286/p286_329|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p286/p286_198|The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
p286/p286_230|His injury was completely random.
p286/p286_446|He had no problems with discipline.
p286/p286_273|The capital costs are modest.
p286/p286_426|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p286/p286_051|He also presented You Bet!
p286/p286_062|We have to keep our clients.
p286/p286_415|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p286/p286_457|It was his job to check.
p286/p286_363|We have very limited capacity.
p286/p286_398|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p286/p286_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p286/p286_373|Neither woman has been named.
p286/p286_239|Laura is an investment banker.
p286/p286_303|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p286/p286_232|It will affect their work.
p286/p286_433|There is another important factor.
p286/p286_349|What form did that take?
p286/p286_308|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p286/p286_041|Among them are many criminals.
p286/p286_174|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p286/p286_244|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p286/p286_043|He will need that machine.
p286/p286_437|That was a great performance by the team.
p286/p286_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p286/p286_102|I cannot believe this decision.
p286/p286_401|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p286/p286_112|He was forced to quit.
p286/p286_406|The choice is strictly personal.
p286/p286_037|Costs have got to be controlled.
p286/p286_322|I must do something about it.
p286/p286_410|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p286/p286_319|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p286/p286_175|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p286/p286_046|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p286/p286_119|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p286/p286_236|He must get to know himself.
p286/p286_389|The director will be present.
p286/p286_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p286/p286_065|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p286/p286_059|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p286/p286_468|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p286/p286_229|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p286/p286_068|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p286/p286_157|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p286/p286_460|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p286/p286_245|The scientific debate is dead.
p286/p286_447|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p286/p286_451|The jury is still out.
p286/p286_465|It is vital to clarify their role.
p286/p286_221|The result is utterly compelling.
p286/p286_190|His son is a local legend.
p286/p286_450|We make this offer to the parliament.
p286/p286_266|His is a global perspective.
p286/p286_315|I was there five months ago.
p286/p286_169|The bank was now involved.
p286/p286_235|I am considered a teenager.
p286/p286_181|People should not become complacent.
p286/p286_346|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p286/p286_210|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p286/p286_085|The error appeared in a warrant.
p286/p286_108|We could not get any possession.
p286/p286_064|They have to come up with a solution.
p286/p286_038|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p286/p286_088|It's so hard to shift.
p286/p286_090|Theatre is not a museum.
p286/p286_295|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p286/p286_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p286/p286_440|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p286/p286_348|Is our children learning?
p286/p286_040|It is serious - but not that serious.
p286/p286_388|That time may never be broken.
p286/p286_362|My view has now completely changed.
p286/p286_188|We have a long way to go this week.
p286/p286_237|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p286/p286_161|Behind him was his brother.
p286/p286_463|We are now up against it.
p286/p286_318|Holland won by five wickets.
p286/p286_282|That will be a problem for later.
p286/p286_110|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p286/p286_201|We represent a wide range of society.
p286/p286_336|And he goes with it.
p286/p286_196|I cannot say too much about them.
p286/p286_429|I never had a childhood.
p286/p286_397|It gets into the culture.
p286/p286_057|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p286/p286_461|They are defined by law.
p286/p286_289|It wasn't about one player.
p286/p286_049|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p286/p286_197|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p286/p286_070|We speak about the performance.
p286/p286_421|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p286/p286_226|Scotland will play its part.
p286/p286_039|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p286/p286_105|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p286/p286_274|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p286/p286_055|Do I have a favourite?
p286/p286_208|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p286/p286_135|His job was not advertised.
p286/p286_036|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p286/p286_225|This will take several weeks.
p286/p286_278|What was the matter for concern?
p286/p286_252|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p286/p286_061|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p286/p286_095|And does it?
p286/p286_458|The boys are mentally focused.
p286/p286_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p286/p286_442|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p286/p286_143|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p286/p286_302|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p286/p286_307|It was simply no contest.
p286/p286_096|Are you from the rugby?
p286/p286_407|It's too close to call.
p286/p286_063|It seems to have worked.
p286/p286_316|I am a retailer by nature.
p286/p286_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p286/p286_048|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p286/p286_452|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p286/p286_159|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p286/p286_285|These figures are truly terrible.
p286/p286_313|The rescue package is public money.
p286/p286_241|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p286/p286_212|Because he was born in England.
p286/p286_086|We have to offer value for money.
p286/p286_459|The damage has been done.
p286/p286_222|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p286/p286_341|The actor has met with Mandela.
p286/p286_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p286/p286_033|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p286/p286_251|She claimed the day was for young people.
p286/p286_343|My body is clearly capable.
p286/p286_250|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p286/p286_395|After the match, do you?
p286/p286_053|How are you, sir?
p286/p286_240|You could feel the heat.
p286/p286_034|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p286/p286_168|We did what we had to do.
p286/p286_290|That view has not altered.
p286/p286_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p286/p286_291|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p286/p286_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p286/p286_145|Tiger is not the norm.
p286/p286_203|Does the name matter?
p286/p286_359|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p286/p286_077|Even the one she loved.
p286/p286_027|I am pretty careful with money.
p286/p286_411|I've had a wonderful career.
p286/p286_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p286/p286_224|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p286/p286_151|Why change it?
p286/p286_160|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p286/p286_121|It is an impressive record.
p286/p286_214|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p286/p286_335|Six other people were injured.
p286/p286_030|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p286/p286_193|They need to look after themselves.
p286/p286_299|That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
p286/p286_154|Anyone can do the sums.
p286/p286_325|They can go to no other method of fishing.
p286/p286_194|Miller was every bit as happy.
p286/p286_177|They could not match it.
p286/p286_284|They must play for each other.
p286/p286_231|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p286/p286_281|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p286/p286_376|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p286/p286_246|This would include the GM food industry.
p286/p286_277|was everything done to save people?
p286/p286_050|We are a new department.
p286/p286_392|Does it matter?
p286/p286_263|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p286/p286_079|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p286/p286_364|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p286/p286_314|The effect was almost magical.
p286/p286_099|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p286/p286_387|The marshall at the turn was great.
p316/p316_353|It was just awful.
p316/p316_282|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p316/p316_193|It's to do with this place.
p316/p316_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p316/p316_313|How would it work?
p316/p316_137|He is a bully.
p316/p316_276|I just wanted to fly.
p316/p316_206|All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
p316/p316_025|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p316/p316_100|I kept it very simple.
p316/p316_147|And frankly, it's been a while.
p316/p316_420|They responded in the most positive way.
p316/p316_335|That was a disgraceful performance.
p316/p316_188|That would end it for us.
p316/p316_191|I just love lessons.
p316/p316_249|We're just waiting for her reaction.
p316/p316_211|We have a budget in March.
p316/p316_324|It has to reinvent itself.
p316/p316_094|There are no problems between us at all.
p316/p316_367|It is based on his movement records.
p316/p316_337|My son was too young to die.
p316/p316_317|It's a real challenge.
p316/p316_370|There is a changing of the guard.
p316/p316_083|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p316/p316_108|I did not have faith in the procedures.
p316/p316_364|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p316/p316_405|I am glad that justice has been done.
p316/p316_407|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p316/p316_128|The time is up for Iraq to comply.
p316/p316_107|It will have to ratify the deal.
p316/p316_280|So, how did this happen?
p316/p316_143|They exist in name alone.
p316/p316_134|She is not the world champion.
p316/p316_197|It is not just the agencies.
p316/p316_156|Or was it Some kind of a ham?
p316/p316_332|It will not work in our favour.
p316/p316_164|We did not deserve to go through.
p316/p316_343|I was shocked and outraged.
p316/p316_374|We said it will happen one night.
p316/p316_375|It is a flexible concept.
p316/p316_333|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p316/p316_305|It is believed that he had been stabbed.
p316/p316_130|The following are the principal provisions.
p316/p316_096|I've had it for the exams.
p316/p316_026|Meetings will also remain private.
p316/p316_388|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p316/p316_296|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p316/p316_202|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p316/p316_185|That, in a way, is the point.
p316/p316_274|The princess has strong links with Scotland.
p316/p316_221|My attitude is exactly the same as before.
p316/p316_041|There is a new confidence about the club.
p316/p316_175|I have never seen him like that.
p316/p316_171|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p316/p316_210|We are in this for the long haul.
p316/p316_125|And now the pressure is off.
p316/p316_109|I was not a joiner.
p316/p316_376|This election is far from over.
p316/p316_209|It is not a financial issue.
p316/p316_291|We have been going for three years.
p316/p316_323|Is that not uncanny?
p316/p316_142|However, it was a different story in the final.
p316/p316_189|Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
p316/p316_070|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p316/p316_216|It is too much for me.
p316/p316_120|It's great news, isn't it.
p316/p316_158|The things writers and directors say!
p316/p316_318|The police believe that the man was not injured.
p316/p316_215|They will do their own thing.
p316/p316_381|Is that such a bad thing?
p316/p316_045|After that it is up to the boss.
p316/p316_271|She was so full of life.
p316/p316_366|Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
p316/p316_104|That got me out.
p316/p316_186|What is so unusual about this case?
p316/p316_139|I've won the British.
p316/p316_387|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p316/p316_155|Things begin to spring to life.
p316/p316_220|We need a much wider debate.
p316/p316_261|There were no reported casualties on the ground.
p316/p316_001|Please call Stella.
p316/p316_396|They are taking a stand against this.
p316/p316_080|They control the prices paid to farmers.
p316/p316_088|I feel confident about the outcome.
p316/p316_153|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p316/p316_060|However, our players will fight for that.
p316/p316_082|Most of them have already gone home.
p316/p316_228|In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
p316/p316_365|I am delighted to have her back home.
p316/p316_243|It's a scandal, a disgrace.
p316/p316_115|We will win this tie.
p316/p316_342|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p316/p316_226|However, it proved to be the turning point.
p316/p316_253|Why do it?
p316/p316_415|I hope you don't regret it.
p316/p316_112|It has until Saturday.
p316/p316_334|He is on the wrong side.
p316/p316_233|It doesn't look good for her.
p316/p316_390|It changed my life.
p316/p316_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p316/p316_184|Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
p316/p316_413|I have never been overly ambitious.
p316/p316_074|We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
p316/p316_283|There are no quick fixes.
p316/p316_378|Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
p316/p316_063|He said it was for sale.
p316/p316_362|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p316/p316_039|We just want this season to end.
p316/p316_111|Until you hit the big games.
p316/p316_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p316/p316_380|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p316/p316_247|He should emerge as the winner.
p316/p316_244|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p316/p316_047|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p316/p316_326|He was happy with his form.
p316/p316_152|Failure is not an option.
p316/p316_234|She said he did not look too happy.
p316/p316_064|This is a dream come true.
p316/p316_126|You can see the appeal of running away.
p316/p316_270|Feel the heat?
p316/p316_308|We have got to attack.
p316/p316_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p316/p316_030|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p316/p316_310|Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
p316/p316_293|It is planned for London in the spring.
p316/p316_345|It was extremely cold.
p316/p316_173|He declined to provide a breakdown.
p316/p316_246|It will be fine.
p316/p316_071|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p316/p316_084|Weaknesses there are, however.
p316/p316_207|Both men were uninjured.
p316/p316_403|In my experience, he does not do that.
p316/p316_169|Consumers will also benefit.
p316/p316_066|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p316/p316_373|I know we can play a lot better.
p316/p316_304|I didn't feel good.
p316/p316_127|Their opening was disastrous.
p316/p316_295|They would have to go to the Royal.
p316/p316_421|The British government said she was coming home.
p316/p316_172|They must not succeed.
p316/p316_341|The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
p316/p316_288|We are not defeated.
p316/p316_417|This is your country.
p316/p316_315|The film was great.
p316/p316_301|She had denied the charge.
p316/p316_392|It will benefit a lot of people.
p316/p316_248|They are you, the fans.
p316/p316_358|Souter will be back.
p316/p316_410|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p316/p316_200|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p316/p316_212|There was no respite.
p316/p316_230|We all knew it could not be true.
p316/p316_160|It was like a dream to be here.
p316/p316_076|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p316/p316_103|We had to push to get a goal.
p316/p316_049|So, why does he do it?
p316/p316_286|They use them for everything.
p316/p316_299|I am quite excited about it.
p316/p316_048|And they removed a Borderer.
p316/p316_361|It certainly gives you hope.
p316/p316_267|This is the biggest surprise of my life.
p316/p316_401|How do you find the youngsters?
p316/p316_168|That happens in boxing.
p316/p316_275|I am very confident about tomorrow night.
p316/p316_159|I am prepared to step down.
p316/p316_050|I would love to have him home.
p316/p316_114|She has the biggest part.
p316/p316_163|It would help to heal the wounds.
p316/p316_250|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p316/p316_072|It has certainly paid off for him.
p316/p316_322|What did they think of her voice?
p316/p316_154|You look at that.
p316/p316_110|It has to find out what went wrong.
p316/p316_284|The change was not instant.
p316/p316_350|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p316/p316_095|Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
p316/p316_213|I got very, very tired.
p316/p316_371|The boys are very confident.
p316/p316_181|But this relative success has not been easy.
p316/p316_090|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p316/p316_044|The question is, Will it be enough?
p316/p316_382|You do need a check and a balance.
p316/p316_196|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p316/p316_113|I've tried to get on with my life.
p316/p316_273|I began to pray.
p316/p316_340|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p316/p316_195|We shall not be moved.
p316/p316_122|That would depend on the parole board.
p316/p316_338|The air campaign is not over yet.
p316/p316_351|There is a review outgoing at the moment.
p316/p316_043|We accept the challenge.
p316/p316_097|I hope it comes out all right.
p316/p316_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p316/p316_263|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p316/p316_051|It is very unfair, and something should be done.
p316/p316_223|They went back to the seventeenth.
p316/p316_251|What a difference a game can make.
p316/p316_121|It's very ingenious.
p316/p316_277|And he has a tale to tell.
p316/p316_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p316/p316_116|This is totally untrue.
p316/p316_073|He was also a great man.
p316/p316_278|Footballers have also been targeted.
p316/p316_141|I don't have many friends.
p316/p316_009|There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p316/p316_386|I couldn't get out of bed.
p316/p316_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p316/p316_123|It is all up to the Members.
p316/p316_360|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p316/p316_148|Feel for five seconds.
p316/p316_236|Where will the elderly go then?
p316/p316_279|The deadline is real and absolute.
p316/p316_135|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p316/p316_180|We played better after the break.
p316/p316_101|The rest was badminton.
p316/p316_102|It will take several days.
p316/p316_229|I waited and waited.
p316/p316_124|The two sets are different.
p316/p316_260|It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
p316/p316_402|It was a great team effort.
p316/p316_377|So the Government will be damaged.
p316/p316_059|It doesn't look as pretty.
p316/p316_359|I'd like to report a murder.
p316/p316_157|I understood that concern.
p316/p316_383|Thousands of people were missing.
p316/p316_349|We have to open up.
p316/p316_265|Another issue will be policing.
p316/p316_325|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p316/p316_034|There will always be problems on the way.
p316/p316_404|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p316/p316_252|They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
p316/p316_219|We've made a couple of albums.
p316/p316_058|However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
p316/p316_027|Have we tried everything?
p316/p316_106|We are making progress on waiting lists.
p316/p316_320|There was too much at stake.
p316/p316_328|Nato was not a love affair.
p316/p316_227|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p316/p316_399|I think we believed the tie was won.
p316/p316_237|Then it was changed without notice.
p316/p316_089|The driver escaped injury.
p316/p316_394|There may be hope this year, however.
p316/p316_400|Well, there you go.
p316/p316_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p316/p316_297|Which brings us to the point.
p316/p316_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p316/p316_368|It wasn't an easy decision.
p316/p316_414|We were beaten by the better team.
p316/p316_208|My husband was fighting for his life.
p316/p316_133|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p316/p316_162|Either way, it doesn't bother me.
p316/p316_292|We deserved the three points.
p316/p316_290|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p316/p316_393|A new school will be built.
p316/p316_078|Robin Williams is subdued.
p316/p316_093|It's a much bigger problem.
p316/p316_119|This series is for real.
p316/p316_053|That is not the case this time.
p316/p316_418|This is the greatest moment of our lives.
p316/p316_145|All will be revealed in due course.
p316/p316_028|It's not going to work out that way.
p316/p316_150|Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
p316/p316_204|He confirmed his fitness.
p316/p316_117|Or someone wants to say something different.
p316/p316_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p316/p316_065|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p316/p316_355|Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
p316/p316_385|It's time to move on.
p316/p316_354|We are doing okay in the league.
p316/p316_242|Every case is completely different.
p316/p316_307|Let's get to know him.
p316/p316_285|We've got the bronze.
p316/p316_232|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p316/p316_029|We have worked hard.
p316/p316_183|Of course it is still possible.
p316/p316_091|There was no bad behaviour.
p316/p316_217|But is this enough to provoke a killing?
p316/p316_423|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p316/p316_303|Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
p316/p316_384|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p316/p316_238|He had a great game.
p316/p316_298|I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
p316/p316_264|This is still happening in the US.
p316/p316_038|What a week he has had.
p316/p316_339|It's a national sport.
p316/p316_422|We won very easily.
p316/p316_294|War and force are not the only solutions.
p316/p316_182|It was the same with the Dickens.
p316/p316_068|This is far too high.
p316/p316_166|It certainly sounded it at times.
p316/p316_086|Can you imagine a world without design?
p316/p316_258|Hopefully today will be the turning point.
p316/p316_329|It's a production company.
p316/p316_311|It divided audiences at Cannes.
p316/p316_140|And so the cycle continues.
p316/p316_075|It is clear that change is required.
p316/p316_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p316/p316_177|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
p316/p316_199|However, he was later released without charge.
p316/p316_092|Today she has been released.
p316/p316_032|This is not a war on terror.
p316/p316_357|Do you know who we are?
p316/p316_176|And you need to be so resourceful.
p316/p316_194|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p316/p316_037|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p316/p316_131|Too much has already been said.
p316/p316_178|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p316/p316_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p316/p316_306|It is an expensive part of their equipment.
p316/p316_397|They are not left wing.
p316/p316_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p316/p316_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p316/p316_231|Its future is uncertain.
p316/p316_198|There must be boundaries.
p316/p316_035|Why you did it will never be known.
p316/p316_081|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p316/p316_031|Naturally, she said yes.
p316/p316_262|What are you waiting for?
p316/p316_389|I can't describe it.
p316/p316_056|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p316/p316_087|He was caught and fired.
p316/p316_161|The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
p316/p316_069|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p316/p316_412|I have signed a contract.
p316/p316_222|Look at a computer.
p316/p316_105|I would just like someone to confess.
p316/p316_042|I accept that, but is very upsetting.
p316/p316_356|It is time for concerted national action.
p316/p316_079|The judge was very nice.
p316/p316_266|Today was first class.
p316/p316_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p316/p316_138|The case was taken on by his brother.
p316/p316_327|His art was not just about emotions.
p316/p316_348|Chelsea was a great club.
p316/p316_067|What on earth is wrong with you?
p316/p316_395|That is not too bad.
p316/p316_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p316/p316_255|This will be our new beginning.
p316/p316_062|He declined to give further details.
p316/p316_312|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p316/p316_149|I hope it is a good omen.
p316/p316_316|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p316/p316_144|I am not retiring.
p316/p316_411|It is not that sort of inquiry.
p316/p316_085|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p316/p316_132|Now, however, things are different.
p316/p316_372|It was our time maybe.
p316/p316_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p316/p316_319|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p316/p316_225|So what could be better than becoming a captain?
p316/p316_201|I watch the other visitors.
p316/p316_309|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p316/p316_055|But the law is very clear on this.
p316/p316_272|I should have given him one in return.
p316/p316_179|Everything in the world was focused on London.
p316/p316_289|He knows what he's got to do.
p316/p316_214|I am really sorry that he is going.
p316/p316_245|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p316/p316_099|It's a sensible management decision.
p316/p316_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p316/p316_336|There will be no receivers.
p316/p316_409|Taxation should be simplified.
p316/p316_239|The following year, they asked him again.
p316/p316_205|The gap is narrowing.
p316/p316_268|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p316/p316_331|But that is not an issue for now.
p316/p316_302|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p316/p316_287|Who is to benefit from this change?
p316/p316_256|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p316/p316_235|We are aware of the problem.
p316/p316_269|This is a good move for me.
p316/p316_061|Everyone was very saddened.
p316/p316_192|Retirement is on his mind.
p316/p316_052|He had no enemies.
p316/p316_346|Italy would be lukewarm.
p316/p316_224|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p316/p316_167|It will be too hot.
p316/p316_218|I didn't just walk in and get it.
p316/p316_254|It opened last month.
p316/p316_352|The pensioners did not want to know.
p316/p316_136|While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
p316/p316_398|I was the sheep.
p316/p316_098|I will just have to be patient.
p316/p316_321|I read about it in the newspapers.
p316/p316_077|This is a big step up.
p316/p316_190|Sure, he is the best player in the world.
p316/p316_146|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p316/p316_314|We told them in July.
p316/p316_165|It's got to be in the head.
p316/p316_259|We shall be ready for Rangers.
p316/p316_174|But the foundations have been laid.
p316/p316_036|He was in his element.
p316/p316_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p316/p316_187|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p316/p316_241|I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
p316/p316_057|There was only silence.
p316/p316_347|People are using it in their daily lives.
p316/p316_419|Audiences there were shocked.
p316/p316_240|It is the men who create the demand.
p316/p316_046|They were taken to prove a point.
p316/p316_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
p316/p316_281|It's all a part of letting it go.
p316/p316_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p316/p316_118|I think they have to change that.
p316/p316_300|Everyone agrees with that.
p316/p316_344|Not many people like to do that.
p316/p316_054|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p316/p316_330|But we will not be scared.
p316/p316_040|He is looking for a sporting challenge.
p316/p316_406|Its first awards will just do that.
p316/p316_391|But what will we put on it?
p316/p316_257|I have totally had enough.
p316/p316_369|It left me with sadness.
p316/p316_408|That is my preference.
p316/p316_033|It is not for any other purpose.
p316/p316_363|Two people have died.
p316/p316_129|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p316/p316_379|However, we let them back into the game.
p316/p316_170|None of the opinions is good.
p316/p316_151|They will appear again next week.
p316/p316_416|He was all blackened.
p361/p361_097|You didn't get a modified.
p361/p361_090|I was saying, No.
p361/p361_030|We must convince the citizens.
p361/p361_302|It should be easy.
p361/p361_414|I am still waiting for a reply.
p361/p361_141|I'm sure he will be aware of it.
p361/p361_064|But the law is very clear on this.
p361/p361_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p361/p361_379|It's about New Yorkers.
p361/p361_292|It was considered to be topical.
p361/p361_241|He was also very happy to listen.
p361/p361_166|Those are difficult decisions.
p361/p361_073|It is on the news.
p361/p361_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p361/p361_407|She failed to win any of them.
p361/p361_061|As good as they come.
p361/p361_364|It's going to happen.
p361/p361_032|But we need to keep it there.
p361/p361_317|The concerns were unfounded.
p361/p361_228|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p361/p361_119|Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
p361/p361_257|I thought they were just excited.
p361/p361_308|That is a dangerous assumption.
p361/p361_337|What a difference a game can make.
p361/p361_084|Drama is not one of them.
p361/p361_230|Eight others are also believed to have died.
p361/p361_108|The results are very positive.
p361/p361_157|Something has to be put in place.
p361/p361_219|This has gone on too long.
p361/p361_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p361/p361_059|I want to deal with this stuff.
p361/p361_235|That would end it for us.
p361/p361_117|He was taken ill in his office.
p361/p361_216|Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
p361/p361_398|I am delighted to have her back home.
p361/p361_029|The results were very clear.
p361/p361_421|My life is going to go on.
p361/p361_153|It has still to be recovered.
p361/p361_293|Well, that's all right then.
p361/p361_324|We are very proud of him.
p361/p361_224|There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
p361/p361_271|It's not the tour.
p361/p361_202|He should be careful.
p361/p361_222|It is the best place.
p361/p361_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p361/p361_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p361/p361_225|I don't know the full story.
p361/p361_367|By hard work, is the answer.
p361/p361_151|I am extremely sad.
p361/p361_070|We have a strong team at the moment.
p361/p361_305|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p361/p361_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p361/p361_081|Kenny Miller might come through.
p361/p361_124|I didn't think about it again.
p361/p361_186|It was a bit of a shock.
p361/p361_411|I found that we couldn't.
p361/p361_204|I am prepared to step down.
p361/p361_320|I have some comments.
p361/p361_315|They are already there.
p361/p361_276|That is one point of view.
p361/p361_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p361/p361_348|And that was the real problem.
p361/p361_071|This is a dream come true.
p361/p361_345|Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
p361/p361_239|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p361/p361_136|I've never seen anything like it.
p361/p361_074|They said there was nothing.
p361/p361_184|There was nothing she could do.
p361/p361_181|That's not the way to think.
p361/p361_122|It was on my mind a little bit.
p361/p361_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p361/p361_104|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p361/p361_192|Failure is not an option.
p361/p361_066|But we are very near.
p361/p361_236|We didn't and it cost us the game.
p361/p361_128|We've always had something to do.
p361/p361_200|On the face of it, this is excellent news.
p361/p361_334|He should emerge as the winner.
p361/p361_134|It's a matter for the Committee.
p361/p361_389|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p361/p361_269|We call it marriage.
p361/p361_165|He tells the truth and that's important.
p361/p361_352|The duties are still to be drawn up.
p361/p361_289|I have really noticed that this week.
p361/p361_174|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p361/p361_054|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p361/p361_339|They are a very good side, without a doubt.
p361/p361_179|They get money for it now.
p361/p361_392|They would have to go to the Royal.
p361/p361_363|It was up to him.
p361/p361_372|It is very funny.
p361/p361_327|Every case is completely different.
p361/p361_031|I decided it is going to be William.
p361/p361_197|It has been well worth it.
p361/p361_382|He certainly would have approved.
p361/p361_260|Was he confident about his prospects?
p361/p361_423|That was only the start.
p361/p361_326|It just got out of control.
p361/p361_089|We all want to be left alone.
p361/p361_087|This is a personal decision for me.
p361/p361_172|It is a very demanding course.
p361/p361_297|They went back to the seventeenth.
p361/p361_313|I am not ready to walk away.
p361/p361_306|I do my job.
p361/p361_125|And if they fail?
p361/p361_027|He may not need to force that message.
p361/p361_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p361/p361_262|It's been very difficult.
p361/p361_310|I think it's a good sign.
p361/p361_194|We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
p361/p361_287|His remarks were disgraceful.
p361/p361_294|No-one is a winner in this.
p361/p361_299|Again, there was no detail.
p361/p361_069|He said it was for sale.
p361/p361_110|Which is where we come in.
p361/p361_362|He could have given them a lot.
p361/p361_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p361/p361_217|It just could be a good night.
p361/p361_376|Because they didn't want to know.
p361/p361_150|And it was great for me.
p361/p361_050|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p361/p361_127|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p361/p361_244|Sadly it is a mess.
p361/p361_176|If they wish to go, they can go.
p361/p361_353|That there would be discussions.
p361/p361_191|Anything less will not do.
p361/p361_113|He is a pro.
p361/p361_120|I am not very pleased.
p361/p361_220|It is an outrage.
p361/p361_325|There they were, making excuses for him.
p361/p361_265|When she returned, it was a wreck.
p361/p361_060|We will be patient but we will win.
p361/p361_267|It is difficult to say.
p361/p361_062|It is not for me to say.
p361/p361_347|This is still happening in the US.
p361/p361_406|It is truly masterly performance.
p361/p361_058|This resulted in the following.
p361/p361_207|These are serious matters.
p361/p361_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p361/p361_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p361/p361_126|He has gone through the process before.
p361/p361_168|The game was there to be won.
p361/p361_278|Here we go then.
p361/p361_144|It was a big departure.
p361/p361_100|What has changed since then?
p361/p361_162|This means a lot of hard decisions.
p361/p361_130|It will be released in October.
p361/p361_280|I can't wait for it to come out.
p361/p361_333|He has a point.
p361/p361_338|It is their day.
p361/p361_419|Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
p361/p361_356|I did not go looking anywhere else.
p361/p361_301|Then it will come.
p361/p361_298|If we don't do it, someone else will.
p361/p361_057|That was something else.
p361/p361_358|If only it had been.
p361/p361_161|You can see the appeal of running away.
p361/p361_286|And she is very clear on this.
p361/p361_343|I have a cold.
p361/p361_378|I have never seen anything like it.
p361/p361_403|What sort of man is that?
p361/p361_282|Indeed, that has already begun.
p361/p361_094|They just have a go.
p361/p361_290|In a way he was.
p361/p361_417|We are very, very confident.
p361/p361_420|We certainly do not intend to disband.
p361/p361_268|He is not the only one.
p361/p361_137|It was highly successful.
p361/p361_086|It was exactly four months away.
p361/p361_380|That was a real challenge.
p361/p361_142|Until you hit the big games.
p361/p361_266|Nobody is pushing out to the right.
p361/p361_397|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p361/p361_381|They will give it a couple of years.
p361/p361_196|They will be very physical.
p361/p361_341|And we are doing it.
p361/p361_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p361/p361_385|Father is on the train.
p361/p361_391|Everything is coming together well.
p361/p361_233|But it is being pursued.
p361/p361_178|I was just aghast.
p361/p361_212|I am a socialist.
p361/p361_177|However, it was a different story in the final.
p361/p361_167|The omens are not good.
p361/p361_396|They thought they couldn't get any.
p361/p361_215|You can blame the defence.
p361/p361_175|I've won the British.
p361/p361_080|But who is it?
p361/p361_046|The answer was wrong.
p361/p361_258|He will appear in court today.
p361/p361_213|The response was really good.
p361/p361_106|I've done a lot in that building.
p361/p361_316|I'd never given up on myself.
p361/p361_261|What can you do?
p361/p361_065|I thought it was quite a positive result.
p361/p361_105|It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
p361/p361_307|They have to get that sorted.
p361/p361_399|This idea is a good starting point.
p361/p361_377|What do we have to do?
p361/p361_330|In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
p361/p361_203|Everyone knew the family.
p361/p361_036|We felt it was sufficient.
p361/p361_077|I wouldn't give them a grade.
p361/p361_035|He was jailed for four years.
p361/p361_350|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p361/p361_114|They have to tell it as it is.
p361/p361_361|I am very sorry to be here.
p361/p361_395|That will be the criteria for the future.
p361/p361_234|He knew they were there.
p361/p361_160|That is the sensible outcome.
p361/p361_079|We have never been short of volunteers.
p361/p361_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p361/p361_415|We told them in July.
p361/p361_369|This is a major step forward.
p361/p361_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p361/p361_309|Does it make a profit?
p361/p361_085|And we have a singer.
p361/p361_076|I've got to be better than that   Quite.
p361/p361_115|This could easily have been another tragedy.
p361/p361_158|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p361/p361_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p361/p361_221|It is a performance.
p361/p361_393|But we are not afraid of them.
p361/p361_183|Then everyone must consider their future.
p361/p361_365|I don't think so.
p361/p361_410|It has a rally instead of a conference.
p361/p361_344|You've got to hand it to them.
p361/p361_412|He is very sensitive.
p361/p361_103|It could take some time.
p361/p361_357|We had no idea what was going on.
p361/p361_281|I am really sorry that he is going.
p361/p361_304|I will build a house on the site.
p361/p361_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p361/p361_116|You should enjoy the day.
p361/p361_067|Nobody else is at risk.
p361/p361_055|And they removed a Borderer.
p361/p361_131|A kind of effective treatment would be welcomed.
p361/p361_056|That is the way it is.
p361/p361_291|I will never forget that.
p361/p361_154|The conclusion is the same.
p361/p361_416|This was a very tragic accident.
p361/p361_422|It's really part of our mission.
p361/p361_034|I am really ready for it now.
p361/p361_375|There are no quick fixes.
p361/p361_218|But we were wrong.
p361/p361_043|So, we have to go back.
p361/p361_272|So what is the secret of the success?
p361/p361_270|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p361/p361_373|I just hope it's not tonight against us.
p361/p361_366|And that was just about that.
p361/p361_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p361/p361_047|They need to be helped.
p361/p361_223|We tried to get them down.
p361/p361_078|As it should be.
p361/p361_180|I could have been offended.
p361/p361_329|Our own people are coming over on Friday.
p361/p361_288|I did not think it was very proper.
p361/p361_093|I knew him a little.
p361/p361_112|Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
p361/p361_251|That was my last game.
p361/p361_342|It's just not good enough.
p361/p361_188|This is positive and welcome.
p361/p361_139|It has to find out what went wrong.
p361/p361_370|They haven't got the uniform.
p361/p361_355|That would be unsafe.
p361/p361_323|Not that he was complaining.
p361/p361_312|I knew him well.
p361/p361_163|That comes at a cost.
p361/p361_190|Actors like to be in the centre.
p361/p361_182|I can see it now.
p361/p361_340|They are used to it.
p361/p361_331|It will be fine.
p361/p361_096|Nobody called me to explain.
p361/p361_242|It's to do with this place.
p361/p361_424|But what took them so long?
p361/p361_102|I welcome the decision.
p361/p361_318|It doesn't look good for her.
p361/p361_133|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p361/p361_072|The problem is not confined to the UK.
p361/p361_388|Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
p361/p361_107|Music is all consuming.
p361/p361_041|He was in his element.
p361/p361_159|It's a mixture of everything.
p361/p361_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p361/p361_083|It just isn't there.
p361/p361_185|We want to be part of it.
p361/p361_132|That got me out.
p361/p361_311|A winter of discontent awaits.
p361/p361_042|That means an extra two years.
p361/p361_408|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p361/p361_386|It could have been prevented.
p361/p361_052|It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
p361/p361_101|He knows he is good.
p361/p361_243|It's a technical demand.
p361/p361_205|Translation - we got it wrong.
p361/p361_349|But then the problems began.
p361/p361_246|We want to see the maximum of change.
p361/p361_400|She had denied the charge.
p361/p361_273|My husband was fighting for his life.
p361/p361_250|Nothing was meant by it.
p361/p361_025|Something has to be done.
p361/p361_145|She has never mentioned it.
p361/p361_118|We couldn't get enough of it.
p361/p361_404|The message was clear.
p361/p361_068|We are not going to back off.
p361/p361_254|It came in bits and pieces.
p361/p361_226|Part-time staff are being laid off.
p361/p361_156|The driver just insulted me.
p361/p361_371|Well, you don't have time.
p361/p361_037|This decision is folly.
p361/p361_138|We needed someone and we now have him.
p361/p361_237|It attracted no complaints.
p361/p361_211|It is his script.
p361/p361_283|But it's the truth.
p361/p361_109|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p361/p361_409|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p361/p361_346|It was his own decision.
p361/p361_256|They seem to be, anyway.
p361/p361_199|People are trying to run away.
p361/p361_045|He was found again almost a year later.
p361/p361_321|You have to be realistic.
p361/p361_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p361/p361_384|We want this place to work.
p361/p361_198|It was just a feeling.
p361/p361_322|There was nowhere for him to go.
p361/p361_033|It is a case of taking a risk.
p361/p361_387|We have been going for three years.
p361/p361_121|It is just a statement of fact.
p361/p361_095|If it's going in, it goes in.
p361/p361_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p361/p361_248|However we must not be complacent.
p361/p361_374|This is good news for the industry.
p361/p361_314|Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
p361/p361_394|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p361/p361_123|I will just have to be patient.
p361/p361_143|They received no money under the merger.
p361/p361_129|How do you take them away?
p361/p361_171|We can't go on like this.
p361/p361_390|It is planned for London in the spring.
p361/p361_354|It must not happen.
p361/p361_227|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p361/p361_195|You look at that.
p361/p361_088|It's just a failing service.
p361/p361_001|Please call Stella.
p361/p361_277|We are in this for the long haul.
p361/p361_039|It took two minutes to respond.
p361/p361_187|It's not long enough.
p361/p361_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p361/p361_201|This is clearly not abuse.
p361/p361_418|It is a result we should savour.
p361/p361_405|We are going nowhere.
p361/p361_275|It is still under discussion with the board.
p361/p361_296|What do you think?
p361/p361_360|Seven people were critically injured.
p361/p361_295|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p361/p361_098|What kind of person is he?
p361/p361_413|That can benefit the larger companies.
p361/p361_053|It is an important step forward.
p361/p361_026|That is where the damage has been done.
p361/p361_303|Is it worth it?
p361/p361_240|Four of the victims were women.
p361/p361_206|We will be working on that this week, all right.
p361/p361_274|So was the first half.
p361/p361_249|And that was just the start.
p361/p361_099|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p361/p361_259|Or is he?
p361/p361_319|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p361/p361_328|It's all about unfinished business.
p361/p361_335|It is our other home.
p361/p361_063|For that much we must be grateful.
p361/p361_044|I'm sure he does.
p361/p361_247|But those days are dead and gone.
p361/p361_238|Neil is never going to come back.
p361/p361_383|Conditions were less than ideal.
p361/p361_351|From the opening Could It Be Magic?
p361/p361_146|I want my mum.
p361/p361_368|It is really special to me.
p361/p361_147|It seems to have been an own goal.
p361/p361_092|I am delighted to hear this news.
p361/p361_048|It is all starting to come together.
p361/p361_279|No reason was given.
p361/p361_152|This series is for real.
p361/p361_164|And so did the rest of her team.
p361/p361_082|Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
p361/p361_173|Can he do it?
p361/p361_038|And this was well known?
p361/p361_148|Or someone wants to say something different.
p361/p361_140|Only one was from Glasgow.
p361/p361_401|It was cynical and callous.
p361/p361_075|They were looking for things.
p361/p361_051|They were taken to prove a point.
p361/p361_214|The squad is too small.
p361/p361_028|These decisions are not simple.
p361/p361_189|Now he is back on top again.
p361/p361_232|I will never see my son again.
p361/p361_209|She has always been very friendly.
p361/p361_208|The pace is telling.
p361/p361_091|Where are they?
p361/p361_255|You don't see that.
p361/p361_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p361/p361_402|It's a dead end.
p361/p361_049|I am the fastest player on the course.
p361/p361_245|That has to take its toll.
p361/p361_359|So far, it is no more.
p361/p361_231|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p361/p361_284|We have been here before.
p361/p361_135|It will have to ratify the deal.
p361/p361_264|There is no other offer on the table.
p361/p361_170|There is no signature.
p361/p361_229|I just want him to win a tournament.
p361/p361_210|Their loss is heartbreaking.
p361/p361_111|I'm not looking forward to it.
p361/p361_332|Yet the job is far from over.
p361/p361_149|There are no second chances.
p361/p361_040|Why you did it will never be known.
p361/p361_285|And he did that.
p361/p361_155|I wish they would commit to us.
p361/p361_263|Do something that we need.
p361/p361_336|When you think you cannot go on, you can.
p361/p361_253|It is not just the agencies.
p361/p361_300|Let the voters decide.
p361/p361_252|Colour is another problem.
p361/p361_193|That is clearly not happening fast enough.
p361/p361_169|Then there's the casting.
p376/p376_310|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p376/p376_364|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p376/p376_244|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p376/p376_331|I have so much respect for him.
p376/p376_156|The opposite is the case.
p376/p376_100|He is doing the right things.
p376/p376_105|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p376/p376_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p376/p376_072|This is a huge event.
p376/p376_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p376/p376_269|It was the same expression of joy.
p376/p376_338|I drove the ball well.
p376/p376_270|I should be doing that for her.
p376/p376_220|That has been lost.
p376/p376_034|There was no disruption to services.
p376/p376_208|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p376/p376_168|She failed to win another game.
p376/p376_354|The Israeli military denied the claim.
p376/p376_399|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p376/p376_060|And that is about it.
p376/p376_233|I am just in a state of shock.
p376/p376_339|It was all image and no substance.
p376/p376_130|It's the start of something new.
p376/p376_093|That is the worry.
p376/p376_371|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p376/p376_159|It was good to work with them.
p376/p376_420|I can't stop people thinking.
p376/p376_297|They made a huge impression on me.
p376/p376_181|It is a lot of fun.
p376/p376_404|We were fortunate to get an own goal.
p376/p376_418|Indeed, it has already.
p376/p376_184|That would be a miracle.
p376/p376_401|Is it a warning to parents?
p376/p376_277|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p376/p376_001|Please call Stella.
p376/p376_218|I am still waiting for her.
p376/p376_323|It was just great.
p376/p376_271|That is a personal matter.
p376/p376_397|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p376/p376_121|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p376/p376_421|That will be best for him.
p376/p376_343|It's not their fault.
p376/p376_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p376/p376_043|It's harder, believe me.
p376/p376_089|That is the case and remains the case.
p376/p376_250|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p376/p376_293|I can't believe that is the way forward.
p376/p376_408|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p376/p376_257|I really wanted the part.
p376/p376_158|He also seems to have been around forever.
p376/p376_379|It is best value.
p376/p376_359|I told him to stop.
p376/p376_104|I probably was wrong.
p376/p376_344|Anything would be better than this retirement.
p376/p376_107|After that, it's never the same again.
p376/p376_258|He had other things on his mind.
p376/p376_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p376/p376_140|Dewar is the medium.
p376/p376_069|It is the worst of both worlds.
p376/p376_207|More cases are expected.
p376/p376_028|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p376/p376_064|For example they could be in school uniform.
p376/p376_383|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p376/p376_396|The firm was working.
p376/p376_423|I have not been so angry for years.
p376/p376_239|Their attitude was great.
p376/p376_229|It does not stop at the border.
p376/p376_419|I've never done that before in my life.
p376/p376_214|There was a bit of pressure.
p376/p376_213|But he will be extremely active.
p376/p376_242|We played too deeply.
p376/p376_395|This must have been severe.
p376/p376_313|I'm not afraid of that.
p376/p376_146|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p376/p376_112|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p376/p376_340|I know it is going to be difficult.
p376/p376_163|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p376/p376_328|They were both very brave.
p376/p376_217|He didn't win the title.
p376/p376_261|But it's there to be won.
p376/p376_380|They feel it belongs to them.
p376/p376_092|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p376/p376_415|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p376/p376_381|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p376/p376_177|This statement has never been withdrawn.
p376/p376_327|Who will take them after that?
p376/p376_254|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p376/p376_154|It just came into my head that day.
p376/p376_176|There was no basis for their arrest.
p376/p376_180|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p376/p376_162|One of these problems is the railways.
p376/p376_373|In the event, it was to be the latter.
p376/p376_296|Promises were not kept.
p376/p376_190|I'm really proud of him.
p376/p376_305|The time for change is now.
p376/p376_046|We are worried about casualties.
p376/p376_234|I really hope he comes back.
p376/p376_139|He's had a lot of injury problems.
p376/p376_366|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p376/p376_284|I am still very much a director.
p376/p376_353|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p376/p376_102|Now he is in charge of this.
p376/p376_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their homes in the sky.
p376/p376_370|It cannot go on for ever like this.
p376/p376_236|He was a legend.
p376/p376_260|It was just a matter of time.
p376/p376_052|He will be greatly missed.
p376/p376_349|It was a tactical change.
p376/p376_424|Do you mean today?
p376/p376_148|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p376/p376_266|I'm just going to do my best.
p376/p376_315|I am extremely cautious.
p376/p376_325|But they will be less attractive than that.
p376/p376_385|There's not going to be a formula.
p376/p376_223|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p376/p376_361|His strike was superb.
p376/p376_080|I have been very stupid.
p376/p376_228|More than half of the school collapsed.
p376/p376_412|He's a very promising player, indeed.
p376/p376_299|It's not in my nature.
p376/p376_050|That takes a lot of courage.
p376/p376_237|Here we go again.
p376/p376_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p376/p376_289|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
p376/p376_031|They have done nothing of the sort.
p376/p376_117|Eleven events are required.
p376/p376_376|It was just one of those things.
p376/p376_115|We have still got the fight in us.
p376/p376_221|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p376/p376_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p376/p376_155|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p376/p376_300|He was really great.
p376/p376_032|It may have been a cry for help.
p376/p376_358|There was nothing anyone could do.
p376/p376_087|The best defence is a good offence.
p376/p376_280|It was then into overtime.
p376/p376_306|I have been doing it for years.
p376/p376_118|This is really good news for us.
p376/p376_301|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p376/p376_416|They were good neighbours.
p376/p376_272|I don't suppose it matters that much.
p376/p376_302|It's going to be massive.
p376/p376_127|There were moments of humour too.
p376/p376_111|But the casting is also bizarre.
p376/p376_374|We are just waiting for news.
p376/p376_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p376/p376_334|There would be famine.
p376/p376_304|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p376/p376_262|I'm so proud of my team.
p376/p376_135|That was not the norm.
p376/p376_042|I was all alone.
p376/p376_196|This is very disturbing news.
p376/p376_073|He was all blackened.
p376/p376_249|I love this tournament.
p376/p376_216|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p376/p376_114|But what are the songs about?
p376/p376_204|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p376/p376_095|The bookies have got it about right.
p376/p376_039|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p376/p376_283|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p376/p376_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p376/p376_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p376/p376_129|We have been very patient.
p376/p376_070|It has not come.
p376/p376_103|Nothing is going right at the moment.
p376/p376_035|We talk about effective military action.
p376/p376_187|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p376/p376_173|I am not against a further inquiry.
p376/p376_084|They would never let him go.
p376/p376_391|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p376/p376_138|We are not giving up.
p376/p376_265|There is a precedent for the theory.
p376/p376_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p376/p376_099|We're still in the process of making changes.
p376/p376_059|This can be extreme.
p376/p376_098|It's just not very nice.
p376/p376_413|That will be the office.
p376/p376_125|And we were very lucky.
p376/p376_071|It has really been quite appalling.
p376/p376_398|This one would have been.
p376/p376_259|He died in September.
p376/p376_363|I'm delighted for the lads.
p376/p376_263|I hope we can still find a solution.
p376/p376_311|It was good to score the goal today.
p376/p376_165|The minister is the engineer.
p376/p376_065|It will be great.
p376/p376_037|My neighbours are horrified.
p376/p376_211|We are going for it.
p376/p376_128|They were too hard.
p376/p376_062|Michael, he is running!
p376/p376_126|The group will report back in the summer.
p376/p376_150|I am awaiting a reply.
p376/p376_224|Who would be out there, singing?
p376/p376_029|I am not interested in the past.
p376/p376_407|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p376/p376_189|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p376/p376_351|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p376/p376_392|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p376/p376_342|There was no evidence against him.
p376/p376_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p376/p376_153|The car was perfect.
p376/p376_178|It was an outstanding performance.
p376/p376_393|We are not interested in selling him.
p376/p376_377|We very much regret that it has occurred.
p376/p376_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p376/p376_390|It will vote with the US.
p376/p376_036|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p376/p376_088|This is a historic agreement.
p376/p376_206|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p376/p376_085|It will not work a second time.
p376/p376_400|I was never invited.
p376/p376_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p376/p376_268|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p376/p376_166|And the other winners are.
p376/p376_152|I will not walk away from this job.
p376/p376_319|Now that business is banned.
p376/p376_243|But he will do anything.
p376/p376_341|There was no energy behind it.
p376/p376_336|It is highly unlikely.
p376/p376_144|We had never seen him before.
p376/p376_172|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p376/p376_167|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p376/p376_161|I played well but missed a few chances.
p376/p376_174|As well it might be.
p376/p376_195|You have no chance of planning permission.
p376/p376_335|We believe we have a strong case.
p376/p376_276|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p376/p376_417|It is essential that we win the game.
p376/p376_133|The trust has no magic wand.
p376/p376_151|There was no need for such a hostel.
p376/p376_182|There was some merit in that.
p376/p376_193|We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
p376/p376_298|The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
p376/p376_136|The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
p376/p376_056|There were no reports of casualties.
p376/p376_411|It was a surprising decision.
p376/p376_066|It was a good win for us.
p376/p376_367|Are you in this movie?
p376/p376_225|They have got off with murder.
p376/p376_388|In many ways it was disastrous.
p376/p376_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p376/p376_192|It's not long enough.
p376/p376_333|They are unable to say anything.
p376/p376_356|It's one up to the Scots.
p376/p376_199|I'd already had them all.
p376/p376_038|Fuller was the difference.
p376/p376_131|It doesn't mean that much.
p376/p376_097|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p376/p376_309|Is Saddam a threat?
p376/p376_124|Ours is on for two days.
p376/p376_123|That has given me great confidence.
p376/p376_348|This is the direction we need to go.
p376/p376_053|Other people also tried.
p376/p376_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p376/p376_226|They had had time for little else.
p376/p376_252|Almost everyone had some input.
p376/p376_061|Maybe it will work there.
p376/p376_308|We will listen to colleagues.
p376/p376_409|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p376/p376_175|That is no bad thing.
p376/p376_332|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p376/p376_295|I see no need to change.
p376/p376_201|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p376/p376_198|There is a pause.
p376/p376_183|I can't see him reversing that.
p376/p376_255|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p376/p376_205|I fell into it by accident.
p376/p376_405|They were assured that it would.
p376/p376_285|We are playing good football.
p376/p376_094|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p376/p376_219|Scotland is the home of golf.
p376/p376_203|This is the last straw.
p376/p376_101|Blood samples were taken.
p376/p376_157|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p376/p376_307|What's the big idea?
p376/p376_369|We are looking forward to next season.
p376/p376_360|Now they have to do something about it.
p376/p376_362|It's fantastic to win again.
p376/p376_186|That's the law of the land.
p376/p376_074|This is a big game for them.
p376/p376_387|That was enough for the committee.
p376/p376_171|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p376/p376_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p376/p376_145|He then did just that.
p376/p376_137|I feel it is very irrational.
p376/p376_141|I think we can do well.
p376/p376_160|We want to replicate that success.
p376/p376_235|I think it can count against you now.
p376/p376_279|It was worth the wait.
p376/p376_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p376/p376_222|And who would argue with that?
p376/p376_231|I think we did well.
p376/p376_281|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
p376/p376_350|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p376/p376_209|It was a bonus for me really.
p376/p376_312|I feel privileged to be here.
p376/p376_253|We are really good friends.
p376/p376_382|They too refused to come out and talk.
p376/p376_191|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p376/p376_355|We don't have the credible evidence.
p376/p376_241|However, the story may have an happy ending.
p376/p376_256|That, he claimed, was essential.
p376/p376_083|But it was money well spent.
p376/p376_122|It was like being in prison.
p376/p376_232|I have never done that.
p376/p376_110|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p376/p376_273|We want to sort it out.
p376/p376_230|They want this research to continue.
p376/p376_147|We want to keep the pound.
p376/p376_143|It is part and parcel of it.
p376/p376_288|Together, we can make a difference.
p376/p376_227|There is no need for that call.
p376/p376_212|Neither has gone to war.
p376/p376_170|I don't think we could have expected better.
p376/p376_406|And huge, indeed, it is.
p376/p376_077|An appeal was unlikely.
p376/p376_076|We need to know more about her.
p376/p376_132|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p376/p376_075|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p376/p376_414|I was not about to hit him.
p376/p376_278|Since then it has become a tradition.
p376/p376_275|It was to no avail.
p376/p376_389|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p376/p376_247|We are trying to establish a date.
p376/p376_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p376/p376_365|I learned that only yesterday.
p376/p376_345|I did not feel the pressure.
p376/p376_202|I've never regretted coming here.
p376/p376_030|I've got to be pleased with that.
p376/p376_041|Who did it doesn't really matter.
p376/p376_330|It seems to be politics at work again.
p376/p376_320|Worse still, it can be infectious.
p376/p376_303|I was close enough.
p376/p376_210|Today is not about contracts.
p376/p376_054|But Harry has become a franchise.
p376/p376_248|It was love of Helen and the children.
p376/p376_055|I'm looking forward to the next two weeks.
p376/p376_142|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p376/p376_057|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p376/p376_290|They are still in shock.
p376/p376_033|We are doing well.
p376/p376_346|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p376/p376_068|This was an hour before the show.
p376/p376_422|That can happen so easily.
p376/p376_402|Instead, she just went away.
p376/p376_352|With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
p376/p376_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p376/p376_119|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p376/p376_116|It's not even finished.
p376/p376_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p376/p376_079|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p376/p376_251|Nothing has been decided yet.
p376/p376_049|We are in the hat.
p376/p376_081|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p376/p376_240|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p376/p376_410|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p376/p376_188|This is still not good enough.
p376/p376_347|Do not listen to them.
p376/p376_169|So we talked about that for a bit.
p376/p376_179|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p376/p376_321|It is just not working.
p376/p376_197|I am the leader.
p376/p376_108|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p376/p376_372|We would expect it to disappear in time.
p376/p376_090|It was nice to come back.
p376/p376_375|The state is controlled by the left.
p376/p376_287|This is a major step forward for the carers.
p376/p376_322|We didn't know he was even out.
p376/p376_314|It is the icing on the cake.
p376/p376_403|I am glad that he is angry.
p376/p376_274|We will not get rid of them.
p376/p376_317|I spoke to him yesterday.
p376/p376_194|Appointments should be made on merit.
p376/p376_048|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p376/p376_134|Tony Blair said as little.
p376/p376_067|It seems a waste of talents.
p376/p376_096|Audiences there were shocked.
p376/p376_045|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p376/p376_282|It is no surprise at all.
p376/p376_394|They chose to side with terror.
p376/p376_086|Which is fair enough.
p376/p376_368|We have got a full house tonight.
p376/p376_025|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p376/p376_324|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p376/p376_058|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p376/p376_294|Some promoters made insulting offers.
p376/p376_318|I'm a bit annoyed.
p376/p376_149|That never seemed likely.
p376/p376_291|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p376/p376_040|However, you never know.
p376/p376_316|What are the likely solutions?
p376/p376_329|But there was a heavy price to pay.
p376/p376_200|Three years ago he would have been.
p376/p376_264|Nothing else will do.
p376/p376_185|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p376/p376_113|Now is not the moment to leave.
p376/p376_386|They have given up.
p376/p376_026|That was my mistake.
p376/p376_245|There is a growing anger among the group.
p376/p376_326|It was an important part of the course.
p376/p376_091|It's a step forward.
p376/p376_063|It seems to have worked.
p376/p376_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p376/p376_082|They are not a set of options.
p376/p376_164|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p376/p376_267|I've just got to build on this now.
p376/p376_292|There was mystery back then.
p376/p376_106|We have already begun to do that here.
p376/p376_337|Some problems were too complex.
p376/p376_215|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p376/p376_078|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p376/p376_044|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p376/p376_047|A major is a major.
p376/p376_384|The attitude was good today.
p376/p376_378|They took that away.
p376/p376_357|It could really have been a disaster.
p376/p376_286|It is not normal practice.
p376/p376_109|It is not just about the money.
p376/p376_238|Israel has done very little until now.
p376/p376_120|I shouldn't have to put up with it.
p376/p376_051|We have seen a copy of the report.
p376/p376_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p376/p376_027|We can play better than that.
p376/p376_246|We certainly will need to watch him.
p230/p230_384|The marshall at the turn was great.
p230/p230_085|However, it did not end that way.
p230/p230_291|It was never a free kick.
p230/p230_130|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p230/p230_342|In the old days, it was easy.
p230/p230_044|That was the theory, anyway.
p230/p230_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p230/p230_407|The casualties were not named.
p230/p230_126|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p230/p230_033|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p230/p230_128|He was a home referee.
p230/p230_260|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p230/p230_224|What are you not good at?
p230/p230_185|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p230/p230_231|Things were so intense in the studio.
p230/p230_058|It was exactly four months away.
p230/p230_271|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p230/p230_329|We are on a four-year mission.
p230/p230_040|Well, he is an artist.
p230/p230_164|Our position remains the same.
p230/p230_118|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p230/p230_299|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p230/p230_201|Racism has no place in any sport.
p230/p230_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p230/p230_246|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p230/p230_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p230/p230_131|She died at her home.
p230/p230_326|That meant the search was unlawful.
p230/p230_039|This will save interest charges.
p230/p230_287|You get a lot for your money.
p230/p230_328|I would do away with the dress code.
p230/p230_416|No date has been set for a meeting.
p230/p230_237|Must have been at the bar.
p230/p230_169|On the month the weakness was across the board.
p230/p230_195|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p230/p230_339|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p230/p230_073|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p230/p230_140|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p230/p230_267|I should think so, too.
p230/p230_095|We intend to change the model.
p230/p230_375|Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
p230/p230_192|We always felt we could win.
p230/p230_290|The actor has met with Mandela.
p230/p230_414|It is the old story.
p230/p230_151|These days are long gone.
p230/p230_042|People want to see me on the screen.
p230/p230_357|The professor said the results were positive.
p230/p230_094|You are like an animal.
p230/p230_048|It was bound to happen.
p230/p230_233|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p230/p230_066|He also received a medal of honour.
p230/p230_331|This ruling is a farce.
p230/p230_104|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p230/p230_099|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p230/p230_173|But he has a lifeline.
p230/p230_213|All will be revealed in due course.
p230/p230_347|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p230/p230_309|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p230/p230_176|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p230/p230_205|He had suffered a heart attack.
p230/p230_175|City sentiment is in his favour.
p230/p230_115|I can't even get into the A team.
p230/p230_123|We did what we had to do.
p230/p230_143|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p230/p230_146|It was by the numbers.
p230/p230_053|Four other charges were dropped.
p230/p230_296|It took a month and a half to film.
p230/p230_206|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p230/p230_417|We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
p230/p230_071|What do we do?
p230/p230_199|The result is called a patent.
p230/p230_381|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p230/p230_398|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p230/p230_076|Consumer confidence remains an issue.
p230/p230_203|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p230/p230_064|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p230/p230_152|I'm afraid to say anything.
p230/p230_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p230/p230_240|They need to win a trophy.
p230/p230_216|He has made his base in Spain.
p230/p230_378|We are a Scottish company.
p230/p230_293|I would rather look at him.
p230/p230_353|Even the one she loved.
p230/p230_236|It had so much to do with output.
p230/p230_078|This is a true story.
p230/p230_321|It is a road of death.
p230/p230_243|In many ways, that is as important.
p230/p230_145|She has gone to the Catholic school.
p230/p230_133|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p230/p230_202|Tommy is not a problem.
p230/p230_088|You might not make it.
p230/p230_370|We are really good friends.
p230/p230_406|We're obviously disturbed by this case.
p230/p230_163|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p230/p230_393|Motion described it as a unique event.
p230/p230_258|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p230/p230_312|The songs are just so good.
p230/p230_374|She is now on the back benches.
p230/p230_279|There is a case to answer.
p230/p230_306|Rugby is now just like football.
p230/p230_029|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p230/p230_376|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p230/p230_254|She took them for a term.
p230/p230_075|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p230/p230_335|Does that put pressure on us?
p230/p230_035|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p230/p230_358|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p230/p230_051|I have made that offer.
p230/p230_310|We have a clean bill of health.
p230/p230_264|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p230/p230_253|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p230/p230_392|Clark is back on top form.
p230/p230_385|If you can get it.
p230/p230_396|What are they for?
p230/p230_153|We are still getting over it.
p230/p230_307|It could well be military.
p230/p230_001|Please call Stella.
p230/p230_325|I was as strong as a horse.
p230/p230_367|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p230/p230_108|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p230/p230_247|Hospitals are for the ill.
p230/p230_401|You will not feel a thing.
p230/p230_259|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p230/p230_160|And does it?
p230/p230_283|was everything done to save people?
p230/p230_081|They lived for their children.
p230/p230_371|My goal is quite simple.
p230/p230_148|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p230/p230_351|He is not very big, either.
p230/p230_027|He has the courage of the unaware.
p230/p230_248|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p230/p230_318|They are not left wing.
p230/p230_300|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p230/p230_043|The big problem is the lack of grass.
p230/p230_102|This was a good move for me.
p230/p230_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p230/p230_285|Do I think about them often?
p230/p230_089|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p230/p230_273|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p230/p230_178|Tomorrow is a new day.
p230/p230_117|Which can happen any time.
p230/p230_304|I was there five months ago.
p230/p230_366|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p230/p230_157|They will do their own thing.
p230/p230_349|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p230/p230_241|Half the young people had had contact with the police.
p230/p230_077|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p230/p230_282|And they were being paid?
p230/p230_341|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p230/p230_170|One season, they might do well.
p230/p230_387|There was a substantial explosion.
p230/p230_207|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p230/p230_388|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p230/p230_346|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p230/p230_093|But I know the course.
p230/p230_056|We will pay their bills.
p230/p230_408|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p230/p230_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p230/p230_400|It is a large number.
p230/p230_302|He is at war with his knee.
p230/p230_411|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p230/p230_049|We have to bring in new players.
p230/p230_316|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p230/p230_250|We have to compete at our own level.
p230/p230_360|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p230/p230_305|You have to see it like this.
p230/p230_180|She has left the island.
p230/p230_319|McNaughton was not so sure.
p230/p230_362|I am a lucky man.
p230/p230_101|Before the game we went for a pint.
p230/p230_028|Life was like a timetable.
p230/p230_380|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p230/p230_368|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p230/p230_324|We were on our way.
p230/p230_069|It is a job creation scheme.
p230/p230_183|They will run a mile.
p230/p230_105|It is close to call.
p230/p230_225|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p230/p230_337|Do you think we are a top nation?
p230/p230_060|It's not covered by the insurance.
p230/p230_135|I would relish the prospect.
p230/p230_292|It is a recipe for success.
p230/p230_288|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p230/p230_091|The conclusion is the same.
p230/p230_313|The casting is as perfect.
p230/p230_244|Here is a question for you.
p230/p230_415|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p230/p230_209|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p230/p230_125|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p230/p230_238|She died in middle age.
p230/p230_397|Is there a waiting list?
p230/p230_065|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p230/p230_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p230/p230_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p230/p230_315|I must do something about it.
p230/p230_059|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p230/p230_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p230/p230_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p230/p230_317|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p230/p230_147|I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
p230/p230_390|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p230/p230_037|The boy is no longer with us.
p230/p230_303|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p230/p230_154|It has to be now.
p230/p230_365|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p230/p230_181|He played it like a veteran.
p230/p230_395|Are they free?
p230/p230_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p230/p230_046|If not, he should go home.
p230/p230_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p230/p230_137|These men are a part of India.
p230/p230_030|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p230/p230_177|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p230/p230_057|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p230/p230_031|I'm so happy that she did.
p230/p230_235|It is the voice of the survivors.
p230/p230_141|It has to be an event.
p230/p230_363|Nobody else was with me.
p230/p230_092|He was prepared for this.
p230/p230_159|So what is the campaign about?
p230/p230_054|We should be able to cope.
p230/p230_298|It is a symbolic concert.
p230/p230_109|Abbey National is an option.
p230/p230_361|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p230/p230_359|Three years ago he would have been.
p230/p230_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p230/p230_070|It looks like a hit.
p230/p230_242|It is possible to be too good.
p230/p230_284|What was the matter for concern?
p230/p230_132|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p230/p230_277|It is also very valuable.
p230/p230_280|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p230/p230_257|Nato was not a love affair.
p230/p230_144|The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
p230/p230_332|I can see their argument.
p230/p230_038|They said she was stable.
p230/p230_080|It's so hard to shift.
p230/p230_386|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p230/p230_251|They showed a lot of heart.
p230/p230_127|The opposite is the case.
p230/p230_055|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p230/p230_129|This is a successful outcome.
p230/p230_222|Does the name matter?
p230/p230_208|This will take several weeks.
p230/p230_249|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p230/p230_062|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p230/p230_158|You had to go and see him.
p230/p230_052|None has ever been found.
p230/p230_369|They have broken the promise.
p230/p230_083|It might change your life.
p230/p230_191|We represent a wide range of society.
p230/p230_266|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p230/p230_155|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p230/p230_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p230/p230_409|It had been on the cards.
p230/p230_394|I had a fortunate war.
p230/p230_068|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p230/p230_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p230/p230_314|I can hardly believe it.
p230/p230_295|It's got to come from me.
p230/p230_041|He looks like an Afghan.
p230/p230_227|It was a day for records.
p230/p230_223|How do you get it back?
p230/p230_322|The party lasted all night.
p230/p230_352|I have a moral dilemma.
p230/p230_139|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p230/p230_274|We feel very good about it.
p230/p230_134|It was a piece of art.
p230/p230_210|We have an election in eight days.
p230/p230_119|But this time we can have no excuses.
p230/p230_190|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p230/p230_364|We put our bid in last night.
p230/p230_189|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p230/p230_343|There was some merit in that.
p230/p230_036|This represents a tough game for us.
p230/p230_262|Persuaded to change his mind.
p230/p230_138|I was caught out a little bit.
p230/p230_198|I made a terrible start.
p230/p230_413|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p230/p230_255|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p230/p230_217|My life is in the ballet.
p230/p230_270|I was ready for this.
p230/p230_334|It was always an option.
p230/p230_087|It was not an insult.
p230/p230_278|None of this work is guaranteed.
p230/p230_184|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p230/p230_025|It is on the internet.
p230/p230_100|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p230/p230_379|We will win the argument.
p230/p230_112|We have the mental strength.
p230/p230_330|This is a historic occasion.
p230/p230_276|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p230/p230_121|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p230/p230_389|He could face a jail sentence.
p230/p230_212|There is no quick fix.
p230/p230_333|After some discussion they did.
p230/p230_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p230/p230_308|His job was not advertised.
p230/p230_286|That was a gold medal for certain.
p230/p230_348|There was no time scale.
p230/p230_404|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p230/p230_167|It's nice to be nice.
p230/p230_061|But the challenge is in the US.
p230/p230_106|It is an impressive record.
p230/p230_281|They can leave at any time.
p230/p230_268|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p230/p230_161|Are you from the rugby?
p230/p230_344|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p230/p230_311|And we can do it.
p230/p230_215|The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
p230/p230_174|Phase one was a shambles.
p230/p230_166|We believe in the medium term.
p230/p230_113|You can spend money on housing.
p230/p230_372|This is a major championship.
p230/p230_032|The wedding was in Edinburgh.
p230/p230_034|He really is a lovely man.
p230/p230_228|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p230/p230_149|However, he was later released without charge.
p230/p230_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p230/p230_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p230/p230_336|Did it work?
p230/p230_405|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p230/p230_047|I must take a seat.
p230/p230_171|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p230/p230_182|I have spoken to head office.
p230/p230_188|He lives in a neighbouring village.
p230/p230_179|It makes no influence on the public.
p230/p230_107|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p230/p230_354|You have no chance of planning permission.
p230/p230_356|In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
p230/p230_050|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p230/p230_096|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p230/p230_402|I've never seen a game like it.
p230/p230_103|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p230/p230_234|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p230/p230_355|We are encouraged by the news.
p230/p230_350|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p230/p230_263|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p230/p230_399|That investment has now been secured.
p230/p230_373|It's going to be fun.
p230/p230_382|I always knew she was funny.
p230/p230_072|Why do it otherwise?
p230/p230_232|I was not sure whether I had won.
p230/p230_196|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p230/p230_261|You can feel at home in China.
p230/p230_172|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p230/p230_214|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p230/p230_124|She was also very brave.
p230/p230_340|You may have a short memory.
p230/p230_120|They are very happy with the new settlement.
p230/p230_116|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p230/p230_045|I was inspired by two things.
p230/p230_211|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p230/p230_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p230/p230_245|I was just a kid.
p230/p230_063|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p230/p230_323|The group is not paying a dividend.
p230/p230_165|Nobody did in those days.
p230/p230_383|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p230/p230_410|The second goal was superb.
p230/p230_269|I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
p230/p230_230|That has been the easy part.
p230/p230_265|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p230/p230_114|That admission is not surprising.
p230/p230_218|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p230/p230_074|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p230/p230_168|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p230/p230_204|This is a holy place.
p230/p230_338|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p230/p230_110|The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
p230/p230_086|We will deal with the refugees.
p230/p230_194|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p230/p230_220|His second was a beauty.
p230/p230_239|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p230/p230_084|You are a great player.
p230/p230_142|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p230/p230_097|Two of the team became ill.
p230/p230_252|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p230/p230_297|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p230/p230_156|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p230/p230_226|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p230/p230_122|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p230/p230_289|In that moment, I was happy.
p230/p230_272|They are interior designers and architects.
p230/p230_221|What do we want to do that for?
p230/p230_200|We played them off the pitch.
p230/p230_079|By then, he was walking on water.
p230/p230_345|The airport was even different.
p230/p230_150|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p230/p230_391|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p230/p230_219|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p230/p230_026|Smoking is also very important.
p230/p230_090|I did not have a bet on myself.
p230/p230_327|We have a good healthy debate.
p230/p230_186|He prefers to play for them.
p230/p230_162|Had I heard?
p230/p230_377|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p284/p284_405|It will take place in July.
p284/p284_410|You know the sort of thing.
p284/p284_030|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p284/p284_056|I expect a rapid response.
p284/p284_186|Peace was won.
p284/p284_422|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p284/p284_246|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p284/p284_141|That group reported just before Christmas.
p284/p284_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p284/p284_235|Our policy is clear.
p284/p284_177|I've been there.
p284/p284_390|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p284/p284_233|The car was just there.
p284/p284_187|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p284/p284_210|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p284/p284_361|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p284/p284_363|The pair are very much in love.
p284/p284_092|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p284/p284_138|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p284/p284_274|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p284/p284_193|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p284/p284_139|I was awful.
p284/p284_095|I love the Dome.
p284/p284_211|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p284/p284_162|They are not advertised.
p284/p284_360|She is free.
p284/p284_407|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p284/p284_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p284/p284_049|Here's a clue.
p284/p284_333|It is a job creation scheme.
p284/p284_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p284/p284_293|And it's a goodbye from him.
p284/p284_071|He was at home with his pals.
p284/p284_305|They are wrong.
p284/p284_142|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p284/p284_153|We are on a four-year mission.
p284/p284_272|She looked so young.
p284/p284_271|They seem to get away with it.
p284/p284_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p284/p284_102|They make a selective perception process.
p284/p284_219|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p284/p284_070|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p284/p284_091|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p284/p284_134|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p284/p284_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p284/p284_216|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p284/p284_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p284/p284_281|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p284/p284_164|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p284/p284_398|It can help.
p284/p284_313|We want to play at the worlds.
p284/p284_068|We should have known.
p284/p284_181|What has caused the demise of singing?
p284/p284_301|Nothing is safe.
p284/p284_269|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p284/p284_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p284/p284_111|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p284/p284_169|Is Saddam a threat?
p284/p284_382|It is hard to understand.
p284/p284_276|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p284/p284_077|Even the one she loved.
p284/p284_295|Who can predict?
p284/p284_392|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p284/p284_359|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p284/p284_348|A great deal has been achieved.
p284/p284_291|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p284/p284_041|Dancing was her life.
p284/p284_311|The minister is the engineer.
p284/p284_237|You can feel at home in China.
p284/p284_074|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p284/p284_036|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p284/p284_061|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p284/p284_227|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p284/p284_250|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p284/p284_078|People must remain vigilant.
p284/p284_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p284/p284_127|The people will come.
p284/p284_241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p284/p284_135|I don't know the full story.
p284/p284_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p284/p284_170|As we worked.
p284/p284_205|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p284/p284_261|This is a question of Islam.
p284/p284_244|It was a hit.
p284/p284_303|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p284/p284_352|They should take their mobile phones.
p284/p284_152|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p284/p284_058|There's a danger.
p284/p284_033|This is the window.
p284/p284_099|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p284/p284_231|But it's a subtle process.
p284/p284_155|He was asked to quit.
p284/p284_391|You had to go and see him.
p284/p284_048|Our people are ready.
p284/p284_258|There's not much money in cycling.
p284/p284_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p284/p284_386|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p284/p284_175|Everyone can be bought.
p284/p284_245|There's the mix.
p284/p284_317|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p284/p284_252|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p284/p284_273|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p284/p284_223|My wife and family are the support system.
p284/p284_395|We try to keep it right.
p284/p284_093|Then came the crunch.
p284/p284_376|It is a simple equation.
p284/p284_136|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p284/p284_377|Clark is back on top form.
p284/p284_165|Again, we were lucky.
p284/p284_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p284/p284_080|Who will pay for this?
p284/p284_366|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p284/p284_387|That's the name of the game, though.
p284/p284_179|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p284/p284_279|You feel very helpless.
p284/p284_388|It's like a car crash.
p284/p284_285|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p284/p284_329|We are in the end game.
p284/p284_039|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p284/p284_248|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p284/p284_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p284/p284_121|We enjoyed it today.
p284/p284_267|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p284/p284_097|I am extremely sad.
p284/p284_172|It is not either national standards or local control.
p284/p284_349|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p284/p284_379|The task is enormous.
p284/p284_411|I knew the script.
p284/p284_319|Your father was a good man.
p284/p284_154|My Dad is a hero.
p284/p284_166|They will do their own thing.
p284/p284_168|One season, they might do well.
p284/p284_157|He can do no wrong.
p284/p284_335|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p284/p284_345|I've got no secret.
p284/p284_040|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p284/p284_173|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p284/p284_076|The party is up for it.
p284/p284_190|Is that success?
p284/p284_183|Our team is just so young.
p284/p284_369|Their time has gone.
p284/p284_057|What was the main difference?
p284/p284_320|Such actions are rarely popular.
p284/p284_330|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p284/p284_037|It's a fact.
p284/p284_238|The scene is about this?
p284/p284_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p284/p284_312|The letters are going out today.
p284/p284_129|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p284/p284_419|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p284/p284_243|I should think so, too.
p284/p284_122|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p284/p284_137|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p284/p284_402|But we are a young side.
p284/p284_266|We're in shock.
p284/p284_417|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p284/p284_315|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p284/p284_174|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p284/p284_105|Oil embargo endorsed.
p284/p284_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p284/p284_051|I was inspired by two things.
p284/p284_143|It is not just about pay.
p284/p284_283|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p284/p284_326|The problems began a long time ago.
p284/p284_199|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p284/p284_370|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p284/p284_278|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p284/p284_264|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p284/p284_393|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p284/p284_324|I would love it.
p284/p284_322|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p284/p284_275|If not, he should go home.
p284/p284_156|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p284/p284_213|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p284/p284_367|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p284/p284_163|Seven people were later detained by police.
p284/p284_340|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p284/p284_185|It is a farce.
p284/p284_254|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p284/p284_240|It was a kind of contempt.
p284/p284_104|That's all right then.
p284/p284_310|You should be.
p284/p284_308|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p284/p284_341|He was the architect.
p284/p284_001|Please call Stella.
p284/p284_381|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p284/p284_321|We have got to get the points from this one.
p284/p284_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p284/p284_212|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p284/p284_232|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p284/p284_325|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p284/p284_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p284/p284_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p284/p284_318|The show is at an end.
p284/p284_339|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p284/p284_159|These days are long gone.
p284/p284_406|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p284/p284_328|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p284/p284_304|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p284/p284_106|Before the game we went for a pint.
p284/p284_287|Bombing slaughter rejected
p284/p284_110|It was a funny game.
p284/p284_323|Henman has been warned.
p284/p284_064|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p284/p284_344|Two people were interviewed.
p284/p284_222|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p284/p284_124|I can't even get into the A team.
p284/p284_239|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p284/p284_418|It is legally binding.
p284/p284_362|Yet he left a few days later.
p284/p284_384|I was lost.
p284/p284_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p284/p284_131|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p284/p284_072|It was magic.
p284/p284_351|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p284/p284_309|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p284/p284_044|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p284/p284_171|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p284/p284_412|It might be.
p284/p284_399|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p284/p284_409|Then , he laughs.
p284/p284_115|It is so sad.
p284/p284_400|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p284/p284_084|They lived for their children.
p284/p284_365|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p284/p284_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p284/p284_314|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p284/p284_242|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p284/p284_065|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p284/p284_161|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p284/p284_415|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p284/p284_123|There were no grounds for his action.
p284/p284_100|May not have been at fault?
p284/p284_338|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p284/p284_249|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p284/p284_042|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p284/p284_256|They must play for each other.
p284/p284_194|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p284/p284_413|Feel the air, the space.
p284/p284_289|No Briton has ever won.
p284/p284_158|Was this element always there?
p284/p284_128|No production was achieved.
p284/p284_358|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p284/p284_069|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p284/p284_125|She really suffered for her art.
p284/p284_265|The system can work.
p284/p284_225|We were awful.
p284/p284_126|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p284/p284_374|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p284/p284_113|It was the eighties.
p284/p284_062|It's that kind of place.
p284/p284_081|He had taken everything from me.
p284/p284_253|We have to expand.
p284/p284_355|We have big ideas.
p284/p284_372|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p284/p284_148|The weather forecast isn't good.
p284/p284_203|It had all been arranged.
p284/p284_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p284/p284_191|They are ready.
p284/p284_336|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p284/p284_337|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p284/p284_085|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p284/p284_385|Something is wrong.
p284/p284_133|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p284/p284_423|It was little else.
p284/p284_306|I can live with it.
p284/p284_055|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p284/p284_075|Is there a new way forward?
p284/p284_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p284/p284_234|The whole thing will be great.
p284/p284_052|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p284/p284_288|We are not going to forget.
p284/p284_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p284/p284_196|There was no safety net.
p284/p284_073|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p284/p284_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p284/p284_286|This is a national crisis.
p284/p284_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p284/p284_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p284/p284_117|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p284/p284_035|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p284/p284_282|He will address the nation this evening.
p284/p284_214|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p284/p284_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p284/p284_045|Among them are many criminals.
p284/p284_299|I was the sheep.
p284/p284_046|It is marvellous.
p284/p284_200|There was an e-mail.
p284/p284_397|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p284/p284_197|It was worth a photograph.
p284/p284_176|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p284/p284_112|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p284/p284_371|They believed it worked.
p284/p284_368|There was a substantial explosion.
p284/p284_394|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p284/p284_198|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p284/p284_414|He scored a touchdown.
p284/p284_421|Eriksson would have approved.
p284/p284_180|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p284/p284_217|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p284/p284_268|It's a way of life.
p284/p284_356|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p284/p284_029|They have no history.
p284/p284_424|He is to appeal.
p284/p284_114|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p284/p284_302|One was a lawyer.
p284/p284_215|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p284/p284_053|My fitness was very poor.
p284/p284_300|What has altered?
p284/p284_146|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p284/p284_201|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p284/p284_027|Is this accurate?
p284/p284_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p284/p284_334|Relief was beyond belief.
p284/p284_103|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p284/p284_059|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p284/p284_396|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p284/p284_401|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p284/p284_096|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p284/p284_207|In each case they were a goal down.
p284/p284_063|They are real.
p284/p284_229|There is no excuse.
p284/p284_195|It's all about money, money, money.
p284/p284_101|They tried to deny it.
p284/p284_132|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p284/p284_380|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p284/p284_292|The songs are just so good.
p284/p284_082|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p284/p284_343|He has to learn.
p284/p284_383|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p284/p284_270|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p284/p284_182|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p284/p284_184|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p284/p284_189|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p284/p284_342|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p284/p284_408|It is full-scale.
p284/p284_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p284/p284_236|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p284/p284_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
p284/p284_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p284/p284_378|There is no signature.
p284/p284_060|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p284/p284_145|So I got a blood test.
p284/p284_043|We will push.
p284/p284_144|Note the date.
p284/p284_067|That was a gold medal for certain.
p284/p284_150|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p284/p284_147|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p284/p284_327|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p284/p284_346|This is a big advantage.
p284/p284_259|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p284/p284_425|Nato will prevail.
p284/p284_277|We are a grandmother.
p284/p284_420|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p284/p284_218|It's not before time.
p284/p284_087|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p284/p284_118|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p284/p284_094|It is annoying.
p284/p284_284|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p284/p284_353|Eight months later, he was dead.
p284/p284_375|They have not done so this season so far.
p284/p284_230|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p284/p284_228|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p284/p284_079|Today she has been released.
p284/p284_260|I am just trying to do my job.
p284/p284_192|I have a cold.
p284/p284_026|We will be homeless.
p284/p284_025|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p284/p284_331|There was no time scale.
p284/p284_083|By then, he was walking on water.
p284/p284_188|I came home by ambulance.
p284/p284_416|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p284/p284_332|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p284/p284_347|I'm very lucky.
p284/p284_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p284/p284_294|The goals will come.
p284/p284_032|There's a story, too.
p284/p284_298|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p284/p284_088|It is a lifeline.
p284/p284_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p284/p284_357|I first met him last summer.
p284/p284_297|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p284/p284_255|Is that a serious question?
p284/p284_251|Chelsea was a great club.
p284/p284_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p284/p284_263|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p284/p284_130|It plans to return to this field.
p284/p284_119|It is rubbish.
p284/p284_098|It is a love affair.
p284/p284_116|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p284/p284_167|Does that put pressure on us?
p284/p284_089|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p284/p284_220|The report is due out next month.
p284/p284_031|I'd just like to play.
p284/p284_140|The idea is simple.
p284/p284_204|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p284/p284_404|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p284/p284_221|But she was.
p284/p284_403|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p284/p284_086|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p284/p284_206|It's not ideal.
p284/p284_224|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p284/p284_202|I am delighted for Simon.
p284/p284_054|Sadly, it can't.
p284/p284_354|I HAVE a dream.
p284/p284_066|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p284/p284_262|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p284/p284_226|They tried to give her advice.
p284/p284_209|I might come back.
p284/p284_047|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p284/p284_038|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p284/p284_160|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p284/p284_307|Work has started.
p284/p284_316|Special measures were needed.
p284/p284_247|Is there on his hands?
p284/p284_350|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p284/p284_373|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p284/p284_178|Four policemen were wounded.
p284/p284_364|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p284/p284_151|I was on a roll.
p284/p284_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p284/p284_090|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p284/p284_107|She reflects a bit.
p284/p284_050|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p284/p284_389|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p374/p374_190|It's a matter of time.
p374/p374_342|So what is their secret?
p374/p374_247|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p374/p374_086|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p374/p374_127|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p374/p374_187|I know nothing about that.
p374/p374_151|They may differ on other issues.
p374/p374_202|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p374/p374_115|They have just got to believe in themselves.
p374/p374_315|It's never over until it's over.
p374/p374_207|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p374/p374_257|Our thoughts are with his family.
p374/p374_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p374/p374_184|But it did not last.
p374/p374_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p374/p374_224|Does a lot of drawing.
p374/p374_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p374/p374_193|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p374/p374_045|As a player you have to move on.
p374/p374_289|Perhaps we should do the same.
p374/p374_274|He got very close tonight.
p374/p374_058|The net is closing.
p374/p374_230|We used to keep our business rates.
p374/p374_099|He loved it, and so did they.
p374/p374_364|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p374/p374_280|I am also delighted for all the players.
p374/p374_421|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p374/p374_160|And sooner than we may think.
p374/p374_311|It was just awful.
p374/p374_232|We need to think.
p374/p374_167|I'd never given up on myself.
p374/p374_106|Let that be their memorial.
p374/p374_322|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p374/p374_146|It was indeed a night to remember.
p374/p374_405|They have not given them the evidence.
p374/p374_093|It doesn't always work that way.
p374/p374_305|There have been different reports from different people.
p374/p374_216|There was great support all round the route.
p374/p374_422|Next year this time  we will be home.
p374/p374_368|It is a matter for Westminster.
p374/p374_380|Is something which we just don't do.
p374/p374_055|I suspect the latter.
p374/p374_079|He got his degree.
p374/p374_300|Because we do not need it.
p374/p374_350|We were unlucky not to score.
p374/p374_404|Well, you can't have everything.
p374/p374_082|I have great respect for all my players.
p374/p374_423|That time has passed.
p374/p374_294|This is a club on the rise.
p374/p374_210|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p374/p374_418|And well he might.
p374/p374_140|The whole region is in shock.
p374/p374_209|They were that poor.
p374/p374_067|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p374/p374_137|Now, that would impress the kids.
p374/p374_118|It ignores the future.
p374/p374_372|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p374/p374_276|It is our other home.
p374/p374_042|YOU thought it was a headache.
p374/p374_334|We just want them home.
p374/p374_392|These days are over.
p374/p374_265|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p374/p374_198|His name is Michael Owen.
p374/p374_183|It was just one of those days.
p374/p374_277|Where do you start?
p374/p374_129|You're not going to get hurt.
p374/p374_331|SO now we know the secret.
p374/p374_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p374/p374_031|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p374/p374_161|It is a step up.
p374/p374_235|For once it wasn't about money.
p374/p374_406|We need to chat.
p374/p374_266|I am expecting to win.
p374/p374_304|There's a story, too.
p374/p374_205|Smith has not let him down.
p374/p374_030|And that was just for starters.
p374/p374_321|It's not one for the purists.
p374/p374_306|But it has all been worthwhile.
p374/p374_143|I told the players that at half-time.
p374/p374_314|I am not a threat to coaches.
p374/p374_249|I get very excited by that.
p374/p374_255|There is great potential on this river.
p374/p374_263|Is this accurate?
p374/p374_123|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p374/p374_376|I want to get at the truth.
p374/p374_394|Well, you can have a tree.
p374/p374_396|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p374/p374_164|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p374/p374_302|They use them for everything.
p374/p374_349|By hard work, is the answer.
p374/p374_353|And that brings us to the point.
p374/p374_329|This is great news for us.
p374/p374_375|The mood was euphoric.
p374/p374_154|Next league matches Motherwell.
p374/p374_367|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p374/p374_339|And that's good news for the magpies.
p374/p374_050|He had reason to be pleased.
p374/p374_336|He has two children.
p374/p374_237|That doesn't happen in Europe.
p374/p374_282|He did very well, but didn't win.
p374/p374_213|All these things have an impact.
p374/p374_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p374/p374_155|I have been there already.
p374/p374_121|Paterson was the man.
p374/p374_256|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p374/p374_285|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p374/p374_246|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p374/p374_124|It is too early to speculate.
p374/p374_141|Where is the logic in that?
p374/p374_245|It is just so sad.
p374/p374_365|My game is coming back.
p374/p374_410|He said it was the worst possible result.
p374/p374_416|That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
p374/p374_054|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p374/p374_041|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p374/p374_048|However, it's good to turn the page.
p374/p374_420|It feels like too much.
p374/p374_102|Two and a half million people have died.
p374/p374_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p374/p374_069|It's going to be epic.
p374/p374_032|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p374/p374_111|We were never told it was already decided.
p374/p374_195|The stadium was full.
p374/p374_351|I did not have a bet on myself.
p374/p374_326|We cannot go on like this.
p374/p374_104|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p374/p374_071|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p374/p374_186|No-one has ever seen inside.
p374/p374_033|I will always remember the horrible images.
p374/p374_223|I wonder what they listen to?
p374/p374_354|Clark is back on top form.
p374/p374_270|All of us do.
p374/p374_173|The rest is his own.
p374/p374_170|Little girls are his victims.
p374/p374_382|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p374/p374_243|We can make a difference.
p374/p374_034|What you sow, you have to reap.
p374/p374_080|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p374/p374_100|I want to be there by right.
p374/p374_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p374/p374_378|It was located on the remote control.
p374/p374_194|This is the New Edinburgh.
p374/p374_047|I am inclined to play it down.
p374/p374_310|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p374/p374_414|So what was he really doing?
p374/p374_061|It was on fire.
p374/p374_107|We're all paying for it.
p374/p374_323|It really is good to be back.
p374/p374_163|However, it is not all bad news for women.
p374/p374_027|The game today is certainly different.
p374/p374_356|It does seem a mystery.
p374/p374_330|We certainly have to try something.
p374/p374_044|Does that put pressure on us?
p374/p374_324|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p374/p374_359|It's a good start.
p374/p374_261|I just want to get rid of it.
p374/p374_340|But we can't have a casino.
p374/p374_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p374/p374_344|It was not being marketed properly.
p374/p374_299|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p374/p374_046|It is so out of character.
p374/p374_066|We were very much a happy family.
p374/p374_259|The court has not decided.
p374/p374_327|The biggest thing is structure.
p374/p374_252|It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
p374/p374_056|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p374/p374_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p374/p374_110|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p374/p374_077|It is not a standing army.
p374/p374_286|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p374/p374_203|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p374/p374_409|I certainly will not settle.
p374/p374_233|We are very happy with the verdict.
p374/p374_264|But what did it matter?
p374/p374_148|There is something in this.
p374/p374_180|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p374/p374_320|No one was listening.
p374/p374_218|That is just not true.
p374/p374_309|This is as bad as it can get.
p374/p374_393|They do it properly.
p374/p374_091|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p374/p374_001|Please call Stella.
p374/p374_403|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p374/p374_134|They are a good team.
p374/p374_267|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p374/p374_272|That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
p374/p374_239|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p374/p374_178|There's no reason for panic.
p374/p374_179|We have got away with it.
p374/p374_231|I suspect that it will.
p374/p374_117|I fell in love with it.
p374/p374_075|I'd love to do another Olympics.
p374/p374_189|Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
p374/p374_126|They went to the press.
p374/p374_328|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p374/p374_360|One person had a broken back.
p374/p374_374|This is the goal.
p374/p374_269|We don't need to change the law.
p374/p374_073|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p374/p374_318|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p374/p374_168|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p374/p374_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p374/p374_371|Sport is good for you.
p374/p374_217|I had nothing to lose.
p374/p374_273|We can only do that for so long.
p374/p374_303|I've already got this.
p374/p374_335|And we have beaten them before.
p374/p374_401|Or so it seemed.
p374/p374_181|I was doing well at the hustings.
p374/p374_348|We won't go down without a struggle.
p374/p374_171|It is not for me, though.
p374/p374_112|It was a sickening sight.
p374/p374_292|Just a year later he was dead.
p374/p374_060|That took a long time to happen.
p374/p374_296|That was the theory, anyway.
p374/p374_174|The statement was a lie.
p374/p374_383|It's the only thing.
p374/p374_291|It opened last month.
p374/p374_284|People don't feel safe, including me.
p374/p374_152|That's the important thing.
p374/p374_388|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p374/p374_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p374/p374_260|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p374/p374_333|What is that?
p374/p374_037|He didn't want me to leave the house.
p374/p374_150|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p374/p374_049|His condition was serious but stable.
p374/p374_132|It had been in place since last July.
p374/p374_379|I am not changing my mind.
p374/p374_133|Players want to know what is on offer.
p374/p374_125|It's up to them.
p374/p374_053|That alibi is now gone.
p374/p374_138|It was the only possible decision.
p374/p374_036|I was contacted this morning.
p374/p374_363|But when we do it is great.
p374/p374_088|Now it has been eclipsed.
p374/p374_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p374/p374_114|I don't think it would make any difference.
p374/p374_064|You, the British people, are the boss.
p374/p374_128|We are very pleased.
p374/p374_120|That's not going to happen again.
p374/p374_038|It's not just a challenge for us.
p374/p374_043|I still hope to go.
p374/p374_147|Raymond was always on the outside.
p374/p374_384|Two others were also seriously injured.
p374/p374_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p374/p374_108|Lester was like that.
p374/p374_417|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p374/p374_097|However, this is only the start.
p374/p374_220|This is not a European Army.
p374/p374_101|That was very important.
p374/p374_399|I was influenced by all of these things.
p374/p374_162|You probably have never seen them before.
p374/p374_149|And so it should.
p374/p374_262|I have not come in to take over.
p374/p374_377|Everyone here is very sad.
p374/p374_268|I was an athlete.
p374/p374_063|Nobody did in those days.
p374/p374_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p374/p374_234|They want it to work.
p374/p374_295|I had a sense of deja vu.
p374/p374_338|It was a matter of choice.
p374/p374_166|I made a mistake.
p374/p374_373|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p374/p374_293|You must be ready to play anyone.
p374/p374_165|Something has got to change.
p374/p374_313|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p374/p374_051|We have a problem.
p374/p374_188|We have not given up.
p374/p374_412|It's always the same, isn't it?
p374/p374_096|I'm working at the moment.
p374/p374_222|All of the names are familiar to me.
p374/p374_062|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p374/p374_397|You can't have both.
p374/p374_287|It is something that we will put right.
p374/p374_201|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p374/p374_074|That money could have been coming to Scotland.
p374/p374_271|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p374/p374_389|It was good today.
p374/p374_345|I have been struggling with my form.
p374/p374_229|That is bad enough.
p374/p374_254|This is certainly not the case.
p374/p374_381|He was taken ill in his office.
p374/p374_279|It was the first time they met.
p374/p374_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p374/p374_398|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p374/p374_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p374/p374_072|I didn't mean to kill her.
p374/p374_122|The course is in great condition.
p374/p374_244|This was not a contest.
p374/p374_253|Which means it matters.
p374/p374_065|Where is the discipline?
p374/p374_361|I hope that is the lucky break.
p374/p374_103|I hope they understand that.
p374/p374_214|I thought their commitment was superb.
p374/p374_119|The quality of work is very impressive.
p374/p374_196|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p374/p374_200|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p374/p374_199|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p374/p374_413|I don't make it mystical.
p374/p374_386|For tragedy it is.
p374/p374_052|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p374/p374_225|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p374/p374_109|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p374/p374_238|Jackson may well be right.
p374/p374_116|If that is not a warning, what is it?
p374/p374_385|What's the best thing to do?
p374/p374_215|I'm really proud of my young players.
p374/p374_208|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p374/p374_158|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p374/p374_290|He's very good at relating to adults.
p374/p374_078|This is a great day.
p374/p374_391|The hotel was huge.
p374/p374_288|I had a good life at Rangers.
p374/p374_176|It was a day for records.
p374/p374_317|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p374/p374_366|It was a game they could have won.
p374/p374_424|It will be crucial.
p374/p374_029|I'll take the blame for that.
p374/p374_316|He had been a singer.
p374/p374_177|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p374/p374_242|It could now be up to the courts.
p374/p374_159|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p374/p374_204|It was so unfair.
p374/p374_083|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p374/p374_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p374/p374_025|She had to learn a new discipline.
p374/p374_387|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p374/p374_156|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p374/p374_355|But happily, the story is true.
p374/p374_221|Not so, he insisted.
p374/p374_402|I will have to think about it.
p374/p374_026|This isn't some form of commission.
p374/p374_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p374/p374_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p374/p374_281|We are delighted with that.
p374/p374_219|History is made at the Masters.
p374/p374_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p374/p374_228|The night is young.
p374/p374_089|Our numbers are small.
p374/p374_419|They have not been named.
p374/p374_131|I was very fortunate.
p374/p374_087|It would be very dangerous.
p374/p374_357|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p374/p374_059|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p374/p374_169|That's the kind of production it was.
p374/p374_028|We did it in one take.
p374/p374_081|and their remit is limited.
p374/p374_145|Why is this?
p374/p374_236|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p374/p374_206|They have to be dealt with.
p374/p374_343|It's a great idea.
p374/p374_301|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p374/p374_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p374/p374_068|This time it is official.
p374/p374_212|We're very close to being a good team.
p374/p374_142|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p374/p374_039|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p374/p374_407|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p374/p374_240|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p374/p374_411|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p374/p374_139|How much of a cop out is that?
p374/p374_211|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p374/p374_370|I can't believe the buzz.
p374/p374_358|It's for that reason he should resign.
p374/p374_250|The members have clearly spoken.
p374/p374_319|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p374/p374_192|You encourage them - you can do it.
p374/p374_258|It is a technique.
p374/p374_227|He is doing just that.
p374/p374_113|We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
p374/p374_283|And we're not there yet.
p374/p374_098|They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
p374/p374_144|I see the extended family once a year.
p374/p374_153|But opinion was divided.
p374/p374_278|At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
p374/p374_307|But that's another story for another day.
p374/p374_248|It all depends on the Chancellor.
p374/p374_070|She could easily have been killed.
p374/p374_337|That is the fact of the matter.
p374/p374_298|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p374/p374_395|I just don't know what she was doing.
p374/p374_241|It's always somebody else's.
p374/p374_172|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p374/p374_352|As if they ever stopped.
p374/p374_346|That was about it.
p374/p374_035|We are expecting a big crowd.
p374/p374_191|The number never came.
p374/p374_390|We are all very pleased.
p374/p374_332|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p374/p374_362|It is almost like a family.
p374/p374_341|I'm looking forward to that.
p374/p374_297|I don't know them or anything.
p374/p374_226|There are moments of honesty, too.
p374/p374_175|It is the manager's decision.
p374/p374_076|What method of funding is being used?
p374/p374_130|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p374/p374_197|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p374/p374_135|The contest was already over.
p374/p374_057|It is simple, really.
p374/p374_136|Does it make a profit?
p374/p374_105|It's a very, very special day.
p374/p374_084|There is no question of dithering.
p374/p374_094|This was much worse.
p374/p374_308|It was a foolhardy decision.
p374/p374_182|He had planned to sell it.
p374/p374_408|That was never their agenda.
p374/p374_185|She has been unable to work since.
p374/p374_095|That, though, is not true.
p374/p374_325|It will never happen.
p374/p374_400|You do not change overnight.
p374/p374_369|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p374/p374_251|It was not pretty.
p374/p374_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p374/p374_090|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p374/p374_085|His track record is not promising.
p374/p374_347|It is coming on very well.
p374/p374_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p374/p374_312|There was a hell of a row.
p374/p374_092|It's not right of Labour.
p374/p374_275|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p374/p374_415|Neither could be contacted last night.
p374/p374_040|I've had a ball.
p374/p374_157|Scott and Emily were so happy.
p323/p323_211|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p323/p323_260|There is nothing sinister in it.
p323/p323_150|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p323/p323_398|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p323/p323_382|That will be the sweetness.
p323/p323_193|We have got to get it right.
p323/p323_069|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p323/p323_383|The law will take its course.
p323/p323_354|He died at the hands of his captors.
p323/p323_324|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p323/p323_152|What's it got to do with art?
p323/p323_027|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p323/p323_402|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p323/p323_215|Is being naturally funny enough?
p323/p323_059|It also condemned the suicide bombers.
p323/p323_086|It's an interesting debate to get going.
p323/p323_401|Five officers were injured.
p323/p323_320|It was a virus.
p323/p323_183|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p323/p323_100|But he is something special, is he not?
p323/p323_218|The process itself has taken over.
p323/p323_051|What's it for?
p323/p323_113|I have played really well all year.
p323/p323_184|It would be difficult to argue with that.
p323/p323_190|It is time to come into the limelight.
p323/p323_115|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p323/p323_364|However, who could have predicted this result?
p323/p323_052|Nor does he have any desire to be.
p323/p323_298|Both were later released after a check-up.
p323/p323_407|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p323/p323_286|We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
p323/p323_340|It is a love affair.
p323/p323_316|The council's concern is very simple.
p323/p323_077|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p323/p323_365|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p323/p323_368|There are simply no orders.
p323/p323_225|That was the case with David.
p323/p323_395|He already had had complaints.
p323/p323_400|The Farmer is called an idiot.
p323/p323_284|Is it a threat to union?
p323/p323_393|Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
p323/p323_275|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p323/p323_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p323/p323_335|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p323/p323_163|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p323/p323_235|I think my game is suited to grass.
p323/p323_423|Harold is a rarity.
p323/p323_244|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p323/p323_257|Are we here?
p323/p323_357|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p323/p323_421|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p323/p323_053|How well did they get on?
p323/p323_332|Such is the ego involved.
p323/p323_151|We can do both.
p323/p323_285|We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
p323/p323_304|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p323/p323_267|Such debate is pointless.
p323/p323_227|But who cares?
p323/p323_408|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p323/p323_162|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p323/p323_188|Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
p323/p323_119|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p323/p323_204|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p323/p323_243|The result could be all down to turnout.
p323/p323_361|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p323/p323_250|So far he has not done so.
p323/p323_131|We are in a very strong position.
p323/p323_126|I try not to expect anything.
p323/p323_082|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p323/p323_265|It's a very high number.
p323/p323_146|Boy is the town a mess.
p323/p323_137|Everything was a dead end.
p323/p323_095|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p323/p323_216|Lack of pace is his big problem.
p323/p323_342|Everyone thought they were safe.
p323/p323_064|Then they killed another three.
p323/p323_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p323/p323_096|There is no conflict of interest.
p323/p323_237|He predicted the contest would be very close.
p323/p323_090|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p323/p323_296|I have never seen anything like it.
p323/p323_214|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p323/p323_067|Most of the others were in their twenties.
p323/p323_344|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p323/p323_413|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p323/p323_034|Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
p323/p323_065|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p323/p323_372|This is totally out of character for Stuart.
p323/p323_208|Post offices are closing now.
p323/p323_419|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p323/p323_358|This is a United Kingdom.
p323/p323_104|The decision was designed to shock investors.
p323/p323_338|We work on the same level.
p323/p323_390|There is great interest on our island.
p323/p323_168|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p323/p323_348|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p323/p323_081|General, You didn't get a modified.
p323/p323_088|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p323/p323_371|The problem arises because he does so much.
p323/p323_241|Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
p323/p323_181|This is a mental challenge.
p323/p323_254|Everything is up for grabs.
p323/p323_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p323/p323_252|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p323/p323_075|That is my personal view.
p323/p323_387|There was a fossil on screen.
p323/p323_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p323/p323_125|I have been to see him.
p323/p323_359|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p323/p323_403|We didn't make any of this up.
p323/p323_127|I would never say anything against her.
p323/p323_248|These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
p323/p323_264|That is very hard, alone.
p323/p323_199|It was an accounting error.
p323/p323_370|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p323/p323_322|But it wasn't to be.
p323/p323_048|Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
p323/p323_226|They loved it and it showed.
p323/p323_362|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p323/p323_347|Before the game we went for a pint.
p323/p323_143|She is now planning a visit.
p323/p323_307|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p323/p323_102|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p323/p323_377|He asked how they were doing.
p323/p323_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p323/p323_132|This will have no effect on the championship.
p323/p323_026|Film music was never the same again.
p323/p323_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p323/p323_054|I don't think it is a drawback.
p323/p323_191|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p323/p323_318|This rule is archaic.
p323/p323_038|And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
p323/p323_330|It was very well received.
p323/p323_373|PR will be just one of them.
p323/p323_076|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p323/p323_128|He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
p323/p323_329|I didn't know there was anything wrong.
p323/p323_092|Will they fall out?
p323/p323_360|This is a critical time for football.
p323/p323_036|It is misleading to compare the two.
p323/p323_028|Now it is much easier.
p323/p323_202|She is not in a coma.
p323/p323_045|The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
p323/p323_056|They may have been murdered.
p323/p323_299|We were a little bit nervous.
p323/p323_411|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p323/p323_422|I wish it well.
p323/p323_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p323/p323_176|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p323/p323_415|The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
p323/p323_037|They discussed how he might get involved.
p323/p323_331|If you could find it.
p323/p323_207|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p323/p323_049|So, what's it about?
p323/p323_367|But we're not the same person.
p323/p323_164|But it was to no avail.
p323/p323_229|That period was a struggle.
p323/p323_420|The commission is not the only loser.
p323/p323_169|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p323/p323_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p323/p323_271|It is not great art.
p323/p323_323|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p323/p323_030|This is the best way to do it.
p323/p323_103|He could look after himself, but didn't.
p323/p323_050|We have been let down by these people.
p323/p323_033|Something happened on that island.
p323/p323_397|Of course he does!
p323/p323_363|I think she is supreme.
p323/p323_288|We need to increase the membership.
p323/p323_276|Scotland had great assets.
p323/p323_068|We were beaten by the better team today.
p323/p323_310|The son has autism and other problems.
p323/p323_071|The law has got to be upheld.
p323/p323_313|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p323/p323_309|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p323/p323_166|There are so many people to thank.
p323/p323_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p323/p323_334|It was not known to myself.
p323/p323_238|Who can say?
p323/p323_173|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p323/p323_326|We will deal with the refugees.
p323/p323_155|The encounter was to change his life.
p323/p323_369|They were behind the wheel.
p323/p323_220|We did not even get a free kick.
p323/p323_209|I am pretty careful with money.
p323/p323_280|Have a look at our accounts.
p323/p323_040|They were not up to speed.
p323/p323_156|They should not have behaved in that way.
p323/p323_389|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p323/p323_409|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p323/p323_333|She was totally possessed.
p323/p323_047|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p323/p323_160|It's the best of both worlds.
p323/p323_308|We have other options.
p323/p323_063|But it was a great decision he joked.
p323/p323_118|If it does it means he has failed.
p323/p323_279|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p323/p323_283|We aim to put them out of business.
p323/p323_221|He was married with a young child.
p323/p323_249|People want to see me on the screen.
p323/p323_212|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p323/p323_032|Leisure centres were also affected.
p323/p323_133|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p323/p323_134|It was no more than they deserved.
p323/p323_317|This was not just incongruous.
p323/p323_093|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p323/p323_352|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p323/p323_376|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p323/p323_031|Its role is not to interfere.
p323/p323_222|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p323/p323_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p323/p323_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p323/p323_105|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p323/p323_274|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p323/p323_292|No decision has yet been made.
p323/p323_234|Is your life a little too easy?
p323/p323_385|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p323/p323_343|People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
p323/p323_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p323/p323_044|We've still got a say in this.
p323/p323_273|We have to break that cycle.
p323/p323_290|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p323/p323_311|This makes up for it.
p323/p323_186|The game is now open.
p323/p323_123|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p323/p323_339|Angola was a really hard place.
p323/p323_171|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p323/p323_066|The six others were injured.
p323/p323_194|You could see he was thinking about it.
p323/p323_259|He said to me, Which one, son?
p323/p323_384|The idea has potential for the future.
p323/p323_355|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p323/p323_147|Do yourselves a favour.
p323/p323_223|I became a widow overnight.
p323/p323_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p323/p323_138|It's been a long, long journey.
p323/p323_094|He was not able to talk to us.
p323/p323_200|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p323/p323_277|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p323/p323_142|They would love to do more films.
p323/p323_087|Who does he think will win?
p323/p323_153|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p323/p323_269|The same goes for Russia.
p323/p323_374|The answer is mayhem.
p323/p323_124|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p323/p323_315|All things are possible if you believe.
p323/p323_282|It all changes for her.
p323/p323_396|That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
p323/p323_139|I can give no comment.
p323/p323_404|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p323/p323_388|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p323/p323_149|I said, What does this mean?
p323/p323_201|It has never been worthwhile.
p323/p323_196|We work for the athlete.
p323/p323_062|This is the place to play football.
p323/p323_417|It's been a humbling year.
p323/p323_097|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p323/p323_210|People love to see this stuff.
p323/p323_301|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p323/p323_418|We tend to come good at the end.
p323/p323_055|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p323/p323_262|I've got to provide for my family.
p323/p323_029|However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
p323/p323_336|It is a vicious circle.
p323/p323_144|New blood is essential for progress.
p323/p323_346|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p323/p323_114|We were a shambles at the back.
p323/p323_256|We are a new department.
p323/p323_391|Later they changed their minds.
p323/p323_141|What exactly is your job?
p323/p323_289|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p323/p323_349|There is no credible official announcement.
p323/p323_328|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p323/p323_106|We are not dealing here with refugees.
p323/p323_375|But the fans deserve to know!
p323/p323_117|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p323/p323_281|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p323/p323_303|Detection is often difficult.
p323/p323_130|I see no need for change.
p323/p323_129|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p323/p323_072|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p323/p323_195|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p323/p323_270|What do you think of the hair?
p323/p323_239|My life would be a lot less restrictive.
p323/p323_203|There is no reason to put me out.
p323/p323_073|I mean they have just been a disaster.
p323/p323_287|Tony Blair should get out more.
p323/p323_099|It does seem a mystery.
p323/p323_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p323/p323_145|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p323/p323_325|Then there is the terrain.
p323/p323_300|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p323/p323_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p323/p323_140|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p323/p323_297|I've got the shirt.
p323/p323_206|But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
p323/p323_060|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p323/p323_083|These things just happen.
p323/p323_258|The conversion didn't go over either.
p323/p323_268|It is a very beautiful city.
p323/p323_314|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p323/p323_187|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p323/p323_306|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p323/p323_246|It appears to have been closed down.
p323/p323_042|What is next?
p323/p323_263|It is having a big impact.
p323/p323_219|We had a huge response to that campaign.
p323/p323_291|He was just awesome.
p323/p323_327|It's such a shock.
p323/p323_091|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p323/p323_351|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p323/p323_293|Maybe his time has gone.
p323/p323_111|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p323/p323_319|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p323/p323_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p323/p323_101|Club rugby refuses to die.
p323/p323_158|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p323/p323_122|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p323/p323_295|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p323/p323_148|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p323/p323_240|The key issue for us is public safety.
p323/p323_272|You do not change overnight.
p323/p323_381|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p323/p323_197|It was a good atmosphere.
p323/p323_165|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p323/p323_172|It was not a beautiful game, was it?
p323/p323_247|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p323/p323_098|They are not suitable.
p323/p323_109|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p323/p323_414|Now it's all written down.
p323/p323_175|We have done a deal with IMPACT.
p323/p323_399|The racist abuse was terrible.
p323/p323_312|I'm very puzzled by it.
p323/p323_412|Last night, the row continued.
p323/p323_177|What do they do, anyway?
p323/p323_233|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p323/p323_121|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p323/p323_321|My mother was getting on at me.
p323/p323_261|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p323/p323_001|Please call Stella.
p323/p323_379|I'll have to work on that.
p323/p323_116|No passengers were on board.
p323/p323_159|I got off to a great start.
p323/p323_198|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p323/p323_353|At the same time it is a satire.
p323/p323_039|And it had two seats.
p323/p323_182|He was married with children.
p323/p323_230|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p323/p323_189|Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
p323/p323_025|We've made a couple of albums.
p323/p323_410|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p323/p323_043|Now they have found out the truth.
p323/p323_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p323/p323_154|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p323/p323_228|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p323/p323_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p323/p323_305|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p323/p323_345|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p323/p323_366|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p323/p323_080|Who will run the bigger show?
p323/p323_356|I understand the medical concerns.
p323/p323_394|I want to go home.
p323/p323_078|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p323/p323_242|I went home and wrote about it.
p323/p323_192|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p323/p323_278|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p323/p323_110|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p323/p323_046|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p323/p323_236|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p323/p323_079|The punishment was swift.
p323/p323_179|In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
p323/p323_120|We have a high quality product.
p323/p323_337|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p323/p323_178|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p323/p323_084|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p323/p323_136|I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
p323/p323_057|However this weekend it will be different.
p323/p323_245|There were no violations.
p323/p323_224|We aren't going to play better.
p323/p323_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p323/p323_112|It doesn't make them evil.
p323/p323_108|I've had a very long run.
p323/p323_294|She died in hospital two hours later.
p323/p323_406|A decision about that will be made today.
p323/p323_074|He's a joy to follow.
p323/p323_061|It is very difficult.
p323/p323_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p323/p323_157|I've never seen them down here.
p323/p323_089|An announcement will follow in due course.
p323/p323_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p323/p323_107|It's up to their parents to choose.
p323/p323_167|Nato has left them with no other option.
p323/p323_217|I have no plans to change the oath.
p323/p323_341|I was loving that little girl.
p323/p323_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p323/p323_378|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p323/p323_035|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p323/p323_174|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p323/p323_231|I am an estate agent.
p323/p323_251|Maybe they will show it next year.
p323/p323_058|We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
p323/p323_405|The house was full of smoke.
p323/p323_266|I was not happy about being left out.
p323/p323_085|Are you up for business?
p323/p323_135|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p323/p323_070|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p323/p323_205|So other options had to be explored.
p323/p323_253|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p323/p323_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p323/p323_041|We know the quality of life goes up.
p323/p323_392|This does not create any precedent.
p323/p323_386|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p323/p323_232|The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
p323/p323_185|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p323/p323_180|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p323/p323_170|The stakes are high.
p323/p323_350|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p323/p323_302|I first met him last summer.
p323/p323_161|That is our unfinished business.
p323/p323_255|Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
p323/p323_416|There is a spring in the step.
p323/p323_213|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p323/p323_380|He must be seen to be impartial.
p247/p247_142|I learned that only yesterday.
p247/p247_148|What happened in that game?
p247/p247_121|That might help a bit.
p247/p247_192|I will have to order its destruction.
p247/p247_268|Messages have to be reinforced.
p247/p247_441|There is no hiding place.
p247/p247_344|What are they for?
p247/p247_401|It proved a good decision.
p247/p247_208|This will take several weeks.
p247/p247_138|We did what we had to do.
p247/p247_054|Italy is a beautiful place.
p247/p247_157|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p247/p247_036|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p247/p247_331|This is a moment to seize.
p247/p247_448|There were no formal announcements.
p247/p247_044|Merger would be entirely logical.
p247/p247_100|And they had a case.
p247/p247_197|We represent a wide range of society.
p247/p247_182|His team management was protective.
p247/p247_065|We will pay their bills.
p247/p247_089|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p247/p247_043|Among them are many criminals.
p247/p247_085|Even the one she loved.
p247/p247_141|They made such decisions in London.
p247/p247_150|Was it the wife?
p247/p247_027|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p247/p247_028|Because we do not need it.
p247/p247_037|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p247/p247_301|We will deliver at director level.
p247/p247_217|What was the matter for concern?
p247/p247_207|It gave no further details.
p247/p247_424|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p247/p247_222|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p247/p247_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p247/p247_047|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p247/p247_240|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p247/p247_422|The projections are very positive for South Africa.
p247/p247_453|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
p247/p247_092|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p247/p247_436|There is another important factor.
p247/p247_241|She was an only child.
p247/p247_341|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p247/p247_090|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p247/p247_127|I can't even get into the A team.
p247/p247_076|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p247/p247_306|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p247/p247_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p247/p247_046|It's not a swimming pool out there.
p247/p247_204|They have the cash and the fire power.
p247/p247_088|Those people must be accountable.
p247/p247_342|It is inherent in society.
p247/p247_262|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p247/p247_185|City sentiment is in his favour.
p247/p247_275|What form did that take?
p247/p247_406|But the foundations have been laid.
p247/p247_284|These figures are truly terrible.
p247/p247_195|It shows the strength of the roots.
p247/p247_254|I have received no explanation.
p247/p247_326|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p247/p247_332|They come to enjoy themselves.
p247/p247_367|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p247/p247_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p247/p247_286|It is also very valuable.
p247/p247_315|His job was not advertised.
p247/p247_423|That's been all around Europe with me.
p247/p247_329|Investors can be forgiven for caution.
p247/p247_098|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p247/p247_122|However, the problem is timing.
p247/p247_435|It's going to be epic.
p247/p247_308|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p247/p247_349|What do they want us to do?
p247/p247_068|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p247/p247_314|Britain is going to celebrate in style.
p247/p247_295|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p247/p247_229|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p247/p247_050|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p247/p247_094|They lived for their children.
p247/p247_386|The pair are very much in love.
p247/p247_189|They bought the property four years ago.
p247/p247_355|But the New Year was special.
p247/p247_353|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p247/p247_294|It was never a free kick.
p247/p247_202|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p247/p247_273|Is our children learning?
p247/p247_172|It was by the numbers.
p247/p247_074|It wasn't possible to relax.
p247/p247_212|His injury was completely random.
p247/p247_258|Labour was too busy to respond.
p247/p247_377|Two things were clear from the new programme.
p247/p247_302|I wanted to change the formula.
p247/p247_321|A Home Office spokesman said.
p247/p247_156|Before it was an ordeal.
p247/p247_447|That will be best for him.
p247/p247_123|It isn't a happy memory.
p247/p247_425|It was submitted without their knowledge.
p247/p247_271|Did it work?
p247/p247_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p247/p247_084|The party is up for it.
p247/p247_366|He can handle it without any problem.
p247/p247_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p247/p247_227|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p247/p247_328|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p247/p247_289|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p247/p247_439|An alternative must be offered.
p247/p247_364|But we welcome this document.
p247/p247_468|That should get their attention.
p247/p247_455|People are so negative about the whole business.
p247/p247_389|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p247/p247_183|One season, they might do well.
p247/p247_071|Final proposals will be published in February.
p247/p247_381|The major championships will always have a special place.
p247/p247_458|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
p247/p247_177|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p247/p247_417|Shelter also supports the reform.
p247/p247_277|He is quite well organised.
p247/p247_471|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p247/p247_109|The following are the principal provisions.
p247/p247_206|The result is utterly compelling.
p247/p247_415|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p247/p247_379|The group is not paying a dividend.
p247/p247_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p247/p247_365|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p247/p247_323|There was no hint of scandal.
p247/p247_418|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p247/p247_276|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p247/p247_465|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p247/p247_410|The casualties were not named.
p247/p247_083|It is a job creation scheme.
p247/p247_449|He deserves a second chance.
p247/p247_368|I think we'll just keep it.
p247/p247_175|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p247/p247_263|He has also cut a record.
p247/p247_134|But it could be a consequence of our policy.
p247/p247_336|Then followed a bout of flu.
p247/p247_249|Others agreed with this view.
p247/p247_080|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p247/p247_285|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p247/p247_282|There were no problems with the crowds.
p247/p247_419|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p247/p247_384|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p247/p247_136|This should begin in October.
p247/p247_165|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p247/p247_395|He took over our lives.
p247/p247_293|I understand the security issue.
p247/p247_161|His second goal was equally impressive.
p247/p247_358|The pain is still acute.
p247/p247_243|They have to be able to play the game.
p247/p247_077|I was as strong as a horse.
p247/p247_426|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p247/p247_200|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p247/p247_104|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p247/p247_211|January is a bad time of year.
p247/p247_259|You can never tell with the manager.
p247/p247_279|It was a minor incident.
p247/p247_434|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p247/p247_335|Scotland has shown the way.
p247/p247_184|It is not either national standards or local control.
p247/p247_171|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p247/p247_396|It seems a long time ago.
p247/p247_475|The chief constable has retired.
p247/p247_304|He will address the nation this evening.
p247/p247_115|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p247/p247_038|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p247/p247_340|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p247/p247_290|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p247/p247_431|No date has been fixed for his return.
p247/p247_096|The woman is basically off her head.
p247/p247_105|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p247/p247_093|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p247/p247_169|It is not normal practice.
p247/p247_440|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p247/p247_035|That is the face of fear.
p247/p247_248|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p247/p247_376|That is a crazy situation.
p247/p247_382|There is no deal as yet.
p247/p247_443|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p247/p247_421|He seems to be used to the attention.
p247/p247_343|Are they free?
p247/p247_461|It's because they can't understand the language.
p247/p247_205|The early physical reports were clear.
p247/p247_159|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p247/p247_414|After the match, do you?
p247/p247_356|Other people had looked at it.
p247/p247_196|I'm interested in interesting work.
p247/p247_288|None of this work is guaranteed.
p247/p247_174|The strong pound also took its toll.
p247/p247_397|They have not done so this season so far.
p247/p247_394|Theatre is not a museum.
p247/p247_269|I didn't see the point.
p247/p247_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p247/p247_101|It was clear on Thursday.
p247/p247_300|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p247/p247_030|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p247/p247_312|I was there five months ago.
p247/p247_307|But it has been an amazing experience.
p247/p247_318|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
p247/p247_413|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p247/p247_120|There's still plenty time left.
p247/p247_357|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p247/p247_124|We have the mental strength.
p247/p247_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p247/p247_322|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p247/p247_476|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p247/p247_233|It will be strictly cross-country.
p247/p247_350|Is it worth it?
p247/p247_278|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p247/p247_067|It came as a surprise.
p247/p247_087|I've had it for the exams.
p247/p247_460|The boys are mentally focused.
p247/p247_330|The party lasted all night.
p247/p247_246|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p247/p247_110|Before the game we went for a pint.
p247/p247_403|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p247/p247_429|Such an attack is bizarre.
p247/p247_291|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p247/p247_075|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p247/p247_178|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p247/p247_216|was everything done to save people?
p247/p247_034|The company did not declare a dividend.
p247/p247_408|But they can also be managed by telephone.
p247/p247_064|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p247/p247_188|Talks are at an advanced stage.
p247/p247_168|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p247/p247_154|how do you get it back?
p247/p247_370|He had no access to the database.
p247/p247_287|There's not much money in cycling.
p247/p247_420|That is not the position of the British relatives.
p247/p247_437|We've made a couple of albums.
p247/p247_250|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.
p247/p247_247|I am not going to go tomorrow.
p247/p247_082|It happens on an annual basis.
p247/p247_078|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p247/p247_324|I was brought up in a mining background.
p247/p247_255|Mr Smith declined to comment.
p247/p247_059|So is that it, then?
p247/p247_445|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p247/p247_166|It has become a way of life.
p247/p247_334|And he goes with it.
p247/p247_061|What do we do?
p247/p247_140|This is the highlight of my career.
p247/p247_099|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p247/p247_129|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p247/p247_033|It carried a double message.
p247/p247_144|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p247/p247_031|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p247/p247_398|It is a simple equation.
p247/p247_359|He said something in his work.
p247/p247_265|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p247/p247_470|They were good years for him.
p247/p247_152|What do we want to do that for?
p247/p247_383|It's as wide as a church in here.
p247/p247_267|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p247/p247_479|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p247/p247_405|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p247/p247_116|We deserve a significant rise.
p247/p247_292|It was exactly four months away.
p247/p247_221|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p247/p247_232|We played them off the pitch.
p247/p247_260|We have no information on Iraq.
p247/p247_117|You had better believe it.
p247/p247_193|You know the sort of thing.
p247/p247_362|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p247/p247_226|The process will start tomorrow.
p247/p247_039|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p247/p247_149|Are you going to win?
p247/p247_218|Do I think about them often?
p247/p247_393|It has happened for generations.
p247/p247_170|Nothing was meant by it.
p247/p247_363|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p247/p247_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p247/p247_303|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
p247/p247_041|The boy is no longer with us.
p247/p247_091|We have to offer value for money.
p247/p247_095|Potions said he would drive.
p247/p247_162|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p247/p247_296|It's hard to see it.
p247/p247_373|Neither woman has been named.
p247/p247_450|It certainly appeared that way.
p247/p247_264|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p247/p247_214|I had relied on him.
p247/p247_040|It is serious - but not that serious.
p247/p247_464|I'm very passionate about my country.
p247/p247_131|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p247/p247_234|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p247/p247_191|I put the drawing down.
p247/p247_055|We have to keep our clients.
p247/p247_409|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p247/p247_225|I am considered a teenager.
p247/p247_454|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p247/p247_180|They could not match it.
p247/p247_380|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
p247/p247_057|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p247/p247_372|He had no previous convictions.
p247/p247_153|Does the name matter?
p247/p247_113|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p247/p247_106|Our preference is to play in midweek.
p247/p247_466|I think it's a great system.
p247/p247_270|Does that put pressure on us?
p247/p247_305|Tony Blair said as little.
p247/p247_215|And they were being paid?
p247/p247_132|Which can happen any time.
p247/p247_164|That view has not altered.
p247/p247_272|Do you think we are a top nation?
p247/p247_245|Those overseas offices were great.
p247/p247_361|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
p247/p247_042|They said she was stable.
p247/p247_299|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p247/p247_444|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p247/p247_219|Is it in the right place?
p247/p247_256|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p247/p247_199|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p247/p247_345|Is there a waiting list?
p247/p247_163|He's not a Celtic man.
p247/p247_111|Our house was very small.
p247/p247_309|The rescue package is public money.
p247/p247_402|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p247/p247_338|It was an achievement all right.
p247/p247_135|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p247/p247_173|We will turn the corner.
p247/p247_086|It makes for an interesting conference.
p247/p247_456|Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.
p247/p247_167|There's always the next century.
p247/p247_333|The people will not be patient.
p247/p247_311|The effect was almost magical.
p247/p247_058|How are you, sir?
p247/p247_378|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p247/p247_242|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p247/p247_146|This represents a tough game for us.
p247/p247_139|But it is different in different regions.
p247/p247_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p247/p247_073|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p247/p247_428|A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.
p247/p247_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p247/p247_045|Everything is possible in football.
p247/p247_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p247/p247_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p247/p247_230|William Hague delighted his party.
p247/p247_238|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p247/p247_190|The Royal Highland was no exception.
p247/p247_151|Why change it?
p247/p247_452|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p247/p247_391|He will consult the right people.
p247/p247_427|My aim is a top six finish.
p247/p247_147|My daughter is an adult.
p247/p247_297|A revival is under way.
p247/p247_347|So what happens next?
p247/p247_231|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p247/p247_001|Please call Stella.
p247/p247_385|to have products for their needs.
p247/p247_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p247/p247_145|You are a gambling man.
p247/p247_473|We will now look into its historical background.
p247/p247_412|How do you take them away?
p247/p247_477|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p247/p247_280|Scotland won by six wickets.
p247/p247_062|Why do it otherwise?
p247/p247_114|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p247/p247_274|How independent is that?
p247/p247_063|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p247/p247_187|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p247/p247_198|It caused a lot of upset.
p247/p247_072|You should try to have a laugh.
p247/p247_056|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p247/p247_474|They were impressive against France.
p247/p247_235|Truth is the child of time.
p247/p247_298|They were worth the money.
p247/p247_317|He was obviously very genuine.
p247/p247_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p247/p247_107|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p247/p247_352|There was some merit in that.
p247/p247_392|Rugby has an extended run.
p247/p247_411|Does it matter?
p247/p247_108|We made a world record together.
p247/p247_026|Meetings will also remain private.
p247/p247_032|It is not for any other purpose.
p247/p247_194|They were seriously after him.
p247/p247_052|The couple actually came upon the accident.
p247/p247_416|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p247/p247_051|We would have concerns about suspension.
p247/p247_360|It's wonderful to have won.
p247/p247_048|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p247/p247_430|The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.
p247/p247_158|Anyone can do the sums.
p247/p247_442|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p247/p247_467|They're just a good retailer.
p247/p247_244|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p247/p247_438|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p247/p247_459|The damage is all inside.
p247/p247_261|Persuaded to change his mind.
p247/p247_266|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p247/p247_320|I first met him last summer.
p247/p247_228|The transaction is not feasible.
p247/p247_210|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p247/p247_433|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p247/p247_025|They are very clever in their use of words.
p247/p247_399|Ferguson must take the blame.
p247/p247_053|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p247/p247_281|They are interior designers and architects.
p247/p247_102|But it is up again.
p247/p247_128|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p247/p247_126|You can spend money on housing.
p247/p247_348|Had this been common practice?
p247/p247_369|It is a stroke of genius.
p247/p247_472|And it covers the spectrum.
p247/p247_432|It was a breathtaking moment.
p247/p247_451|But you can go beyond that condition.
p247/p247_224|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p247/p247_252|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p247/p247_069|Only water is currently allowed.
p247/p247_223|His third goal was superb.
p247/p247_463|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p247/p247_257|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p247/p247_316|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p247/p247_407|There was an element of frustration.
p247/p247_070|It's not covered by the insurance.
p247/p247_319|His appeal is instantly understood.
p247/p247_143|I have accepted the challenge.
p247/p247_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p247/p247_237|The scientific debate is dead.
p247/p247_388|It benefits the whole family.
p247/p247_346|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p247/p247_239|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p247/p247_220|Did he trip?
p247/p247_125|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p247/p247_325|His only reply was a laugh.
p247/p247_079|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p247/p247_374|I got a yellow card.
p247/p247_354|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p247/p247_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p247/p247_387|The team hadn't been picked.
p247/p247_155|That is the ultimate revenge.
p247/p247_209|It was worth a photograph.
p247/p247_462|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p247/p247_179|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p247/p247_251|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p247/p247_375|They have broken that promise.
p247/p247_097|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p247/p247_133|The answer was in space.
p247/p247_371|The members have voted against it.
p247/p247_060|Do I have a favourite?
p247/p247_112|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p247/p247_049|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p247/p247_160|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p247/p247_310|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p247/p247_404|The BBC was a disgrace.
p247/p247_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p247/p247_181|I always felt they played for me.
p247/p247_390|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p247/p247_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p247/p247_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p247/p247_066|We could soon be in that same position!
p247/p247_119|This is a step backwards.
p247/p247_457|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
p247/p247_351|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p247/p247_283|They must play for each other.
p247/p247_337|We will listen to any suggestion.
p247/p247_213|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p247/p247_137|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p247/p247_103|She has so much to offer.
p247/p247_339|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p247/p247_081|She died in hospital two hours later.
p247/p247_203|Because he was born in England.
p247/p247_400|That investment has now been secured.
p247/p247_253|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p247/p247_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p247/p247_446|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p247/p247_236|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p247/p247_029|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p247/p247_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p247/p247_327|Job losses were also announced.
p247/p247_186|It is vital to clarify their role.
p247/p247_176|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p247/p247_469|Now that business is banned.
p247/p247_118|The website has changed the company.
p247/p247_130|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p237/p237_300|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p237/p237_084|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p237/p237_042|This film will be totally awesome.
p237/p237_277|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p237/p237_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p237/p237_334|I saw some good things.
p237/p237_253|We were extremely poor.
p237/p237_214|There was an e-mail.
p237/p237_081|It's all going to clear the debt.
p237/p237_327|The parents will have a great time, too.
p237/p237_025|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p237/p237_194|It is tough, but possible.
p237/p237_129|She really suffered for her art.
p237/p237_283|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p237/p237_229|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p237/p237_126|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p237/p237_332|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p237/p237_043|That is a break with tradition.
p237/p237_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p237/p237_142|He has the edge.
p237/p237_264|There's the mix.
p237/p237_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p237/p237_251|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p237/p237_083|He is driven.
p237/p237_146|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p237/p237_171|I was in the train station overnight.
p237/p237_252|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p237/p237_276|It is also very valuable.
p237/p237_348|Look at the witnesses.
p237/p237_113|It's a shame.
p237/p237_053|She looked so young.
p237/p237_310|This is a war over our home.
p237/p237_281|There is no link.
p237/p237_070|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p237/p237_064|You do not change overnight.
p237/p237_110|Further protests are likely.
p237/p237_071|Try to save us.
p237/p237_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p237/p237_068|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p237/p237_295|I saw it at a ruck.
p237/p237_163|We are now up against it.
p237/p237_329|I am so upset.
p237/p237_175|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p237/p237_213|Now, it's all right.
p237/p237_104|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p237/p237_097|I love the Dome.
p237/p237_179|He was a crazy man.
p237/p237_066|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p237/p237_222|By hard work, is the answer.
p237/p237_205|Tommy is not a problem.
p237/p237_046|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p237/p237_344|The train was on time.
p237/p237_330|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p237/p237_326|In the old days, it was easy.
p237/p237_050|It is bizarre.
p237/p237_059|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p237/p237_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p237/p237_099|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p237/p237_157|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p237/p237_271|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p237/p237_321|I never thought it would take this long.
p237/p237_111|It's in his blood.
p237/p237_193|I wish I could say something.
p237/p237_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p237/p237_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p237/p237_174|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p237/p237_062|None has ever been found.
p237/p237_153|He will emerge as a world leader.
p237/p237_188|Government will intervene.
p237/p237_247|It is not the message alone.
p237/p237_063|It's a real challenge.
p237/p237_210|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p237/p237_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p237/p237_342|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p237/p237_256|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p237/p237_057|I was inspired by two things.
p237/p237_240|You take a risk.
p237/p237_027|I have a theory.
p237/p237_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p237/p237_100|They were outside the circle.
p237/p237_226|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p237/p237_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p237/p237_290|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p237/p237_128|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p237/p237_306|I was the sheep.
p237/p237_297|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p237/p237_041|He did not know his daughter.
p237/p237_045|It is so sad.
p237/p237_036|They're just different.
p237/p237_108|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p237/p237_125|But it took a lot of bottle.
p237/p237_032|There's a story, too.
p237/p237_140|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p237/p237_313|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p237/p237_151|The idea is simple.
p237/p237_208|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p237/p237_243|It's a dead end.
p237/p237_232|I am immensely sad.
p237/p237_079|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p237/p237_122|It is a delight on every level.
p237/p237_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p237/p237_028|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p237/p237_291|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p237/p237_085|Someone who cares
p237/p237_339|They haven't got a hope.
p237/p237_212|I don't want to use it.
p237/p237_185|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p237/p237_060|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p237/p237_230|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p237/p237_187|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p237/p237_095|Until you hit the big games.
p237/p237_235|I can't wait to meet him.
p237/p237_320|They were fantastic.
p237/p237_309|It is a road of death.
p237/p237_257|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p237/p237_184|This is a sad day.
p237/p237_317|It is no surprise.
p237/p237_328|It is a job creation scheme.
p237/p237_103|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p237/p237_325|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p237/p237_106|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p237/p237_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p237/p237_296|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p237/p237_266|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p237/p237_101|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p237/p237_148|He is severe.
p237/p237_346|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p237/p237_195|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p237/p237_033|This is the window.
p237/p237_156|It is huge.
p237/p237_316|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p237/p237_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p237/p237_074|Painful, but only because it's true.
p237/p237_094|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p237/p237_323|It should be equal.
p237/p237_237|They are the innocent victims.
p237/p237_172|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p237/p237_178|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p237/p237_182|One season, they might do well.
p237/p237_124|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p237/p237_120|Does this mean.
p237/p237_080|It may well have been.
p237/p237_287|We're in shock.
p237/p237_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p237/p237_035|I'd like to continue that record.
p237/p237_343|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p237/p237_092|However, it did not end that way.
p237/p237_303|Who can predict?
p237/p237_154|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p237/p237_200|It is a case of taking a risk.
p237/p237_337|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p237/p237_206|The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
p237/p237_162|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p237/p237_349|Nobody else was with me.
p237/p237_073|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p237/p237_192|Miller was every bit as happy.
p237/p237_075|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p237/p237_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p237/p237_260|Our decision making was poor.
p237/p237_087|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p237/p237_107|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p237/p237_131|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p237/p237_315|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p237/p237_322|They wanted the club to make money.
p237/p237_088|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p237/p237_298|Holland won by five wickets.
p237/p237_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p237/p237_341|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p237/p237_224|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p237/p237_173|He is keen to stay in public service.
p237/p237_292|They seem to get away with it.
p237/p237_186|The hotel was now for sale.
p237/p237_199|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p237/p237_234|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p237/p237_263|They are different types.
p237/p237_134|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p237/p237_051|That should do it.
p237/p237_161|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p237/p237_077|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p237/p237_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p237/p237_207|He was also married with two children.
p237/p237_236|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p237/p237_164|I was in daily contact.
p237/p237_167|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p237/p237_314|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p237/p237_248|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p237/p237_259|You can feel at home in China.
p237/p237_029|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p237/p237_254|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p237/p237_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p237/p237_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p237/p237_308|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p237/p237_239|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p237/p237_231|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p237/p237_333|He was then replaced by Ross.
p237/p237_289|She failed in her action.
p237/p237_149|She died at her home.
p237/p237_160|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p237/p237_196|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p237/p237_189|Four policemen were wounded.
p237/p237_233|I'd never seen a play about me.
p237/p237_072|The end result is precisely the same.
p237/p237_048|I feel pretty good.
p237/p237_039|The problem is the pitch.
p237/p237_218|She should not be blamed.
p237/p237_345|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p237/p237_318|We want to play at the worlds.
p237/p237_180|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p237/p237_121|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p237/p237_001|Please call Stella.
p237/p237_304|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p237/p237_141|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p237/p237_340|It has moved on in the last week.
p237/p237_301|That could change.
p237/p237_273|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p237/p237_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p237/p237_203|Is that success?
p237/p237_067|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p237/p237_137|It's perfectly feasible.
p237/p237_076|The price cuts are really exciting.
p237/p237_145|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p237/p237_089|Now the system is right behind us.
p237/p237_177|The release attracted little attention.
p237/p237_238|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p237/p237_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p237/p237_221|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p237/p237_136|They made such decisions in London.
p237/p237_286|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p237/p237_267|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p237/p237_040|It's a great thing.
p237/p237_114|I came to complete.
p237/p237_054|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p237/p237_052|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p237/p237_201|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p237/p237_102|But it was a pleasure.
p237/p237_166|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p237/p237_047|It is urgent.
p237/p237_274|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p237/p237_220|I had decided to quit the show.
p237/p237_061|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p237/p237_275|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p237/p237_190|They receive a high profile in the media.
p237/p237_331|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p237/p237_123|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p237/p237_176|Does that put pressure on us?
p237/p237_034|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p237/p237_170|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p237/p237_280|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p237/p237_270|Special measures were needed.
p237/p237_105|I didn't play well last year.
p237/p237_183|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p237/p237_086|It's never too late.
p237/p237_347|Indeed, it was magical.
p237/p237_250|It's quite a line-up !
p237/p237_165|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p237/p237_246|They should come forward.
p237/p237_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p237/p237_282|This is a question of Islam.
p237/p237_241|They tried to give her advice.
p237/p237_135|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p237/p237_245|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p237/p237_117|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p237/p237_065|Art is extra.
p237/p237_293|People have no choice.
p237/p237_169|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p237/p237_091|Today I couldn't run on it.
p237/p237_118|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p237/p237_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p237/p237_155|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p237/p237_138|They took a risk.
p237/p237_109|It is normal.
p237/p237_228|William Hague delighted his party.
p237/p237_307|Graeme was prepared.
p237/p237_191|It's a joke.
p237/p237_112|Who would be right?
p237/p237_049|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p237/p237_217|He is slightly confused.
p237/p237_311|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p237/p237_069|It is like a river running by my home.
p237/p237_037|It was clear.
p237/p237_132|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p237/p237_299|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p237/p237_143|Three penalties were given.
p237/p237_244|We are in the hat.
p237/p237_265|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p237/p237_144|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p237/p237_312|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p237/p237_133|Who will attend?
p237/p237_279|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p237/p237_127|I'm so angry.
p237/p237_204|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p237/p237_305|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p237/p237_258|Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
p237/p237_351|It should be scrapped.
p237/p237_272|This is a big club.
p237/p237_078|It is a terrible place.
p237/p237_159|It is not normal practice.
p237/p237_335|He can do no wrong.
p237/p237_056|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p237/p237_093|We must look forward.
p237/p237_262|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p237/p237_150|Is that Titanic?
p237/p237_139|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p237/p237_038|It is not for any other purpose.
p237/p237_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p237/p237_268|That could be in place by next year.
p237/p237_338|There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
p237/p237_147|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p237/p237_181|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p237/p237_082|I first met him last summer.
p237/p237_026|They should be so lucky.
p237/p237_278|The warning is timely.
p237/p237_294|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p237/p237_202|Our strategy is straightforward.
p237/p237_227|You have to do your research.
p237/p237_223|The FBI could become involved.
p237/p237_055|Life is good.
p237/p237_284|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p237/p237_096|We could not get any possession.
p237/p237_044|It's the only thing.
p237/p237_216|It is a gamble.
p237/p237_119|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p237/p237_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p237/p237_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p237/p237_168|They should stop the bombing.
p237/p237_242|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p237/p237_350|The composer will conduct.
p237/p237_225|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p237/p237_215|Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
p237/p237_130|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p237/p237_219|I began to pray.
p237/p237_249|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p237/p237_288|You know the type.
p237/p237_031|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p237/p237_211|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p237/p237_198|If the director is with you.
p237/p237_285|Immediate action must be taken.
p237/p237_302|He should have won.
p237/p237_255|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p339/p339_371|I thought it was a great game.
p339/p339_324|The number never came.
p339/p339_287|What do you want.
p339/p339_248|But that is for another day.
p339/p339_216|They know the language.
p339/p339_059|It gives us something to work on.
p339/p339_029|What is a house without it?
p339/p339_313|No-one can take it in.
p339/p339_379|It decided to blame the media.
p339/p339_099|What you sow, you have to reap.
p339/p339_097|The search is due to be completed today.
p339/p339_416|We haven't come out of this very well.
p339/p339_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p339/p339_129|I don't think the referees are against us.
p339/p339_286|I made a mistake.
p339/p339_308|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p339/p339_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p339/p339_160|He would have done the same to me.
p339/p339_177|It is simple, but profound.
p339/p339_047|The jury is still out on this one.
p339/p339_389|It is not designed to kill.
p339/p339_310|We have nothing to lose.
p339/p339_396|It is a technique.
p339/p339_223|Without doubt, they can win the title.
p339/p339_213|It has certainly paid off for him.
p339/p339_079|What we were doing.
p339/p339_087|I am not completely insane.
p339/p339_186|It separates the men from the boys.
p339/p339_395|You can feel the tension in the air.
p339/p339_175|This was much worse.
p339/p339_260|It was an amazing experience.
p339/p339_269|They have to live with the risk.
p339/p339_341|Let's not make that mistake again.
p339/p339_368|He is doing just that.
p339/p339_085|I had a fortunate war.
p339/p339_055|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p339/p339_392|Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
p339/p339_140|My ambition is to make the cut.
p339/p339_035|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p339/p339_344|They have to be dealt with.
p339/p339_136|I am not inclined to believe it.
p339/p339_339|It's a double whammy.
p339/p339_054|I will make that point tonight.
p339/p339_237|I think we're the better side.
p339/p339_196|It was a very strong metaphor.
p339/p339_347|I don't want to go anywhere.
p339/p339_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p339/p339_151|We were extremely lucky.
p339/p339_264|There are no plans to change this.
p339/p339_191|Which is worse?
p339/p339_370|But there are signs of a revival.
p339/p339_031|It's about the balance.
p339/p339_169|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p339/p339_132|We are still waiting.
p339/p339_034|I want somebody with something to prove.
p339/p339_200|I'm very happy that it exploded.
p339/p339_291|Was that not awful?
p339/p339_067|And he's not a bigot.
p339/p339_277|That includes the equipment?
p339/p339_414|Now we must look to the future.
p339/p339_057|Are they going to work together again?
p339/p339_091|I decided to take my time.
p339/p339_225|We are looking to the future.
p339/p339_148|Sadly, he has a point.
p339/p339_230|It has to be put in context.
p339/p339_409|What would you ask?
p339/p339_137|It was on fire.
p339/p339_378|They still have a great sense of humour.
p339/p339_062|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
p339/p339_221|You cannot do that in a lobby.
p339/p339_403|She was so supportive.
p339/p339_351|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p339/p339_229|I have always believed in myself.
p339/p339_232|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p339/p339_036|There was a ban on reporting the trial.
p339/p339_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p339/p339_299|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p339/p339_267|That's the important thing.
p339/p339_072|Today is the first step in that process.
p339/p339_352|My mind is the most important thing now.
p339/p339_192|He has made a step forward.
p339/p339_397|Is it the shape of things to come?
p339/p339_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p339/p339_399|It is about more than Scotland.
p339/p339_145|I certainly think it should be there.
p339/p339_321|I would love to do that.
p339/p339_147|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p339/p339_153|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p339/p339_050|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p339/p339_157|I'm not fit for anything else.
p339/p339_242|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p339/p339_408|Everyone can have their opinion.
p339/p339_176|This was certainly not about money.
p339/p339_231|I think we can get there.
p339/p339_382|Our position is quite clear.
p339/p339_294|But it will not work again.
p339/p339_155|It is just a matter of time.
p339/p339_102|To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
p339/p339_278|It does nothing for me.
p339/p339_120|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p339/p339_380|We have chosen for the patients.
p339/p339_304|He had planned to sell it.
p339/p339_219|The quality of work is very impressive.
p339/p339_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p339/p339_372|Just get on with it.
p339/p339_110|But it was only a matter of time.
p339/p339_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p339/p339_401|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p339/p339_317|Yet there is hope.
p339/p339_165|How can they say that?
p339/p339_348|How do we get a bigger stage?
p339/p339_187|This could be wonderful.
p339/p339_333|The problem is fairly serious.
p339/p339_123|But there was everything!
p339/p339_198|I have no problem with that.
p339/p339_202|Lester was like that.
p339/p339_074|It is surprising to come back this way.
p339/p339_365|This is a new beginning.
p339/p339_121|We're very, very happy.
p339/p339_387|Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
p339/p339_113|Sometimes they come off.
p339/p339_127|However, the drama was not over.
p339/p339_369|The night is young.
p339/p339_374|It shows the Government is listening.
p339/p339_388|I cannot describe it.
p339/p339_249|There is a great carry over value.
p339/p339_346|So what was he really doing?
p339/p339_063|I am not retaining him.
p339/p339_107|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p339/p339_363|There are many questions to be answered.
p339/p339_254|It's about taking risks.
p339/p339_234|The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
p339/p339_336|It's the body that counts.
p339/p339_290|And yet, there has been no great impact.
p339/p339_268|Should he resign?
p339/p339_084|There is no change in the strategy.
p339/p339_180|A film is different from a book.
p339/p339_045|he told a producer.
p339/p339_096|What will it be?
p339/p339_420|I am also delighted for all the players.
p339/p339_332|Well, that was the plan.
p339/p339_032|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p339/p339_126|That imbalance was evident in their play.
p339/p339_297|The rest is his own.
p339/p339_018|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p339/p339_134|He will be a major challenger next year.
p339/p339_384|We can make a difference.
p339/p339_292|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p339/p339_189|The other was a football match.
p339/p339_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p339/p339_071|It is extremely fortunate.
p339/p339_353|I had nothing to lose.
p339/p339_391|We'll have to be satisfied with it.
p339/p339_288|That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
p339/p339_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p339/p339_048|We have to work together.
p339/p339_274|However, it is going to happen.
p339/p339_235|The answer is obviously no.
p339/p339_375|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p339/p339_171|Just think about the lines.
p339/p339_233|No, they have played well.
p339/p339_273|This week is a perfect example.
p339/p339_114|We're not that bad.
p339/p339_208|It is not as simple as that.
p339/p339_246|Now, that would impress the kids.
p339/p339_201|We're all paying for it.
p339/p339_402|The first appeared to be successful.
p339/p339_092|Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
p339/p339_272|It was a classic.
p339/p339_424|Which, in effect, it is.
p339/p339_037|I don't think the action was a mistake.
p339/p339_312|He did not report it.
p339/p339_184|We know that from recent experience.
p339/p339_362|I cannot really commit.
p339/p339_315|That is an entirely different discipline.
p339/p339_360|You have to keep the focus alive.
p339/p339_415|I didn't play badly.
p339/p339_163|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p339/p339_070|It has only been rumours.
p339/p339_159|The enemy was time.
p339/p339_405|We await a decision.
p339/p339_281|I think it has worked.
p339/p339_046|That is not the place for her.
p339/p339_108|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p339/p339_124|We are doing very well as we are.
p339/p339_190|They have the players to do it.
p339/p339_300|Who was on the panel?
p339/p339_314|They were following his orders.
p339/p339_271|It was my whole life.
p339/p339_421|He did very well, but didn't win.
p339/p339_066|But that title is a mistake.
p339/p339_095|It is hard to understand.
p339/p339_355|I thought to myself.
p339/p339_089|She had to learn a new discipline.
p339/p339_150|Mind you, all was not lost.
p339/p339_406|It's a matter of balance.
p339/p339_367|They will fight for everything.
p339/p339_407|It is an investment in our product.
p339/p339_343|Only injury has prevented that happening before.
p339/p339_334|No decisions have been taken.
p339/p339_038|You go in there and do it.
p339/p339_040|What will happen to them today?
p339/p339_359|It looks as though there is no chance.
p339/p339_205|We were never told it was already decided.
p339/p339_094|He doesn't even know who he is.
p339/p339_337|Sprinters are not fit.
p339/p339_209|Everything in the symphony is there.
p339/p339_309|She asked for the appointment with me.
p339/p339_411|Where do we spend it?
p339/p339_296|I have nothing to say on that.
p339/p339_404|I'm delighted with our performance.
p339/p339_243|I could have been killed on that day.
p339/p339_345|His manager blamed the referee.
p339/p339_256|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p339/p339_197|We are going to have a party.
p339/p339_043|I said to him.
p339/p339_056|There are two things we have to do.
p339/p339_041|I didn't expect to get one.
p339/p339_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p339/p339_217|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p339/p339_262|He will go on the bench.
p339/p339_199|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p339/p339_158|The day may come, but not for a while.
p339/p339_179|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p339/p339_027|Glasgow is far from overload.
p339/p339_386|So far the weather has been very pleasant.
p339/p339_183|Did they give any good advice?
p339/p339_226|The signs are positive.
p339/p339_390|He has run a hell of a race.
p339/p339_174|I'm so worried about the roads.
p339/p339_168|I would like to make an impact, of course.
p339/p339_327|There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
p339/p339_077|That should be fun.
p339/p339_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p339/p339_061|A government is a government is a government.
p339/p339_303|That is not good for golf!
p339/p339_044|Labour has been found out on public spending.
p339/p339_111|I always liked to get a laugh.
p339/p339_285|But do not rely on it.
p339/p339_275|This time it really could happen.
p339/p339_210|Find them somebody they deserve.
p339/p339_301|It turned out to have been three hours.
p339/p339_164|It would be very dangerous.
p339/p339_412|I don't know how she does it.
p339/p339_112|I still hope to go.
p339/p339_194|This will have to change.
p339/p339_115|Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
p339/p339_076|A review is under way.
p339/p339_316|It was an insult.
p339/p339_214|We're not getting involved.
p339/p339_393|It is good football in Scotland.
p339/p339_116|I feel strongly about it.
p339/p339_090|In fact, he took it very well.
p339/p339_298|I have no worry about that.
p339/p339_322|You'll have to wait and see.
p339/p339_238|We act because we must.
p339/p339_258|There are not too many like him.
p339/p339_204|That's a matter for them.
p339/p339_154|The hearing is expected to continue today.
p339/p339_143|Rangers must be winners, it says.
p339/p339_323|It wasn't the issue.
p339/p339_255|Why is this?
p339/p339_279|That has been lost.
p339/p339_417|They are looking for partners.
p339/p339_109|It was all over now.
p339/p339_284|We're very proud of him and his achievement.
p339/p339_042|It was electric, amazing.
p339/p339_069|Services are being expanded, too.
p339/p339_203|Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
p339/p339_263|The police are hopeless.
p339/p339_357|We're talking to the US.
p339/p339_220|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p339/p339_161|What were they told?
p339/p339_306|But it did not last.
p339/p339_244|They have to come up with a solution.
p339/p339_082|I won't let that happen.
p339/p339_364|Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
p339/p339_257|It was indeed a night to remember.
p339/p339_266|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p339/p339_122|There could be a possible connection.
p339/p339_146|But it does not matter.
p339/p339_228|I see it as my job.
p339/p339_078|Maybe he will act again.
p339/p339_283|There is nothing to be gained from that.
p339/p339_422|There is no shortage of questions.
p339/p339_167|Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
p339/p339_350|I thought their commitment was superb.
p339/p339_318|Referees in Scotland are very weak.
p339/p339_329|He is in charge on the pitch.
p339/p339_195|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p339/p339_335|We won't do that.
p339/p339_064|The police are not the target.
p339/p339_001|Please call Stella.
p339/p339_381|He was at the outset of his career.
p339/p339_125|The Scots are great.
p339/p339_088|We spoke about a few people.
p339/p339_105|We have been so lucky.
p339/p339_342|That's why he is the prime minister.
p339/p339_185|From day one, we were a family.
p339/p339_251|Police are appealing for witnesses.
p339/p339_385|This was not a contest.
p339/p339_119|I thought it was quite good.
p339/p339_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p339/p339_282|No other family members could be contacted.
p339/p339_141|It will be for the committee to decide.
p339/p339_173|I was very influenced by him.
p339/p339_028|It's a big mystery.
p339/p339_166|My condition is not bad.
p339/p339_398|My body is exhausted.
p339/p339_338|This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
p339/p339_354|This is a really serious issue.
p339/p339_276|That sort of thing is long gone.
p339/p339_320|That was a fairy tale.
p339/p339_253|We all knew they could do it.
p339/p339_060|But what did it matter?
p339/p339_270|It is, but that's not the point.
p339/p339_261|Nobody has been put on trial.
p339/p339_259|The memory is there.
p339/p339_349|We're very close to being a good team.
p339/p339_331|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p339/p339_376|They want it to work.
p339/p339_222|We will all suffer as a result.
p339/p339_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p339/p339_156|This news is really depressing.
p339/p339_073|Several others were absent.
p339/p339_101|Six men will take the decision.
p339/p339_358|Thereafter they were again in control.
p339/p339_068|But summer is spent.
p339/p339_245|It is very enjoyable.
p339/p339_224|What's it about?
p339/p339_086|It will probably be my last, too.
p339/p339_239|There are two mysteries.
p339/p339_053|I needed to get away.
p339/p339_138|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p339/p339_250|It was not like that at all.
p339/p339_104|It was a disaster.
p339/p339_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p339/p339_240|The teacher would have approved.
p339/p339_130|It is too much for me.
p339/p339_419|We should have been rewarded for producing.
p339/p339_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p339/p339_311|The first time it was rejected.
p339/p339_162|More cases are expected.
p339/p339_075|But there was no time for that.
p339/p339_340|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p339/p339_083|Or have they?
p339/p339_293|I'm not there yet but it is close.
p339/p339_139|How can they tell?
p339/p339_025|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p339/p339_410|We have got to deal with it.
p339/p339_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p339/p339_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p339/p339_400|It's not just going to be busy.
p339/p339_098|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p339/p339_170|The goal is clear.
p339/p339_295|Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
p339/p339_215|The lottery has helped.
p339/p339_152|It was an amazing time.
p339/p339_207|It is not a road of life.
p339/p339_081|It all happened so suddenly.
p339/p339_383|It could now be up to the courts.
p339/p339_302|That is exactly right.
p339/p339_377|This is a completely new experience for me.
p339/p339_373|Germany also said it was unimpressed.
p339/p339_149|It was so sad.
p339/p339_212|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p339/p339_052|But they were true stories.
p339/p339_178|The funding is now there.
p339/p339_033|It really has not been their season.
p339/p339_326|We are going to listen to Britain.
p339/p339_193|That was very important.
p339/p339_100|He is a one-off.
p339/p339_131|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p339/p339_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p339/p339_182|You'll find out on Saturday.
p339/p339_394|There is no other option.
p339/p339_418|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p339/p339_172|It all depends on the wind.
p339/p339_307|They need to look after themselves.
p339/p339_211|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p339/p339_128|But it was not just the land.
p339/p339_039|We were in Italy  suddenly, we knew.
p339/p339_319|It will not be easy for him.
p339/p339_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
p339/p339_026|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p339/p339_093|We did it in one take.
p339/p339_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p339/p339_325|I really have to go now.
p339/p339_252|I was very surprised.
p339/p339_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p339/p339_135|That question was never asked.
p339/p339_103|We should not be surprised at that.
p339/p339_080|What is the Barnett formula?
p339/p339_305|We know the goals will come.
p339/p339_049|I don't think that he won't be released.
p339/p339_366|There are moments of honesty, too.
p339/p339_030|It was really good in the first week.
p339/p339_289|I think we could do well in Europe.
p339/p339_133|It happened again yesterday.
p339/p339_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p339/p339_241|Are you going to win?
p339/p339_423|Couldn't see the point.
p339/p339_280|But that's another story.
p339/p339_413|I saw it later in the news.
p339/p339_330|We have expected it.
p339/p339_361|It could have been a ceilidh.
p339/p339_144|He was part of the family.
p339/p339_328|Words are not enough.
p339/p339_247|Did it work?
p339/p339_065|It has affected it, obviously.
p339/p339_118|We have to put this behind us.
p339/p339_058|We need to do that every week.
p339/p339_265|We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
p339/p339_206|It is part of our heritage.
p339/p339_188|He loved it, and so did they.
p339/p339_181|Within three days he was dead.
p339/p339_227|I called it right.
p339/p339_051|It means it is difficult.
p339/p339_117|There are exciting days ahead.
p339/p339_218|We shall be victorious.
p339/p339_356|Could it be?
p339/p339_236|I'll take it as it comes.
p339/p339_142|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p301/p301_292|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p301/p301_295|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p301/p301_170|The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
p301/p301_382|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p301/p301_081|He came in an army uniform.
p301/p301_068|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p301/p301_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p301/p301_352|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p301/p301_174|What, then, is the real thing?
p301/p301_411|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p301/p301_341|I am not putting myself down.
p301/p301_124|We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
p301/p301_154|It is good for their eyesight.
p301/p301_388|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p301/p301_041|It doesn't make them evil.
p301/p301_363|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p301/p301_031|I saw the explosion and panicked.
p301/p301_128|He was just awesome.
p301/p301_348|He did not oppose the divorce.
p301/p301_233|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p301/p301_039|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
p301/p301_384|It looks like paradise.
p301/p301_389|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p301/p301_330|It will also take evidence from consumers.
p301/p301_291|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p301/p301_234|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p301/p301_246|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p301/p301_368|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p301/p301_172|The answer is mayhem.
p301/p301_346|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p301/p301_353|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p301/p301_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p301/p301_037|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p301/p301_094|His female companion was being treated for shock.
p301/p301_301|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p301/p301_360|I am not among its admirers.
p301/p301_394|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p301/p301_184|I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
p301/p301_149|What the Department of Transport will make clear.
p301/p301_229|It took more than two years.
p301/p301_347|I just want to change my life.
p301/p301_097|He was married with a young child.
p301/p301_297|They are the innocent victims.
p301/p301_383|Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
p301/p301_255|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p301/p301_278|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p301/p301_042|I have played really well all year.
p301/p301_131|She died in hospital two hours later.
p301/p301_340|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p301/p301_287|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p301/p301_315|We are ready for the long haul.
p301/p301_001|Please call Stella.
p301/p301_322|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p301/p301_176|That will be the sweetness.
p301/p301_296|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p301/p301_320|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p301/p301_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p301/p301_225|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p301/p301_390|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p301/p301_386|We were short of athletes.
p301/p301_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p301/p301_205|He will emerge as a world leader.
p301/p301_334|There is no answer to it.
p301/p301_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p301/p301_266|It was a moment of madness.
p301/p301_179|There was a fossil on screen.
p301/p301_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p301/p301_321|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p301/p301_336|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p301/p301_264|It's the same old story.
p301/p301_328|He is young but not too young.
p301/p301_338|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p301/p301_371|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p301/p301_110|People want to see me on the screen.
p301/p301_224|It had a gigantic effect.
p301/p301_408|I saw some good things.
p301/p301_201|Well, what do you know?
p301/p301_283|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p301/p301_402|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p301/p301_035|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p301/p301_082|However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
p301/p301_126|Tony Blair should get out more.
p301/p301_125|We aim to put them out of business.
p301/p301_075|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p301/p301_245|Which perhaps is just as well.
p301/p301_256|Wagner was never like this.
p301/p301_065|After this, the exercise was due to begin.
p301/p301_112|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p301/p301_140|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p301/p301_156|But you can't have it both ways.
p301/p301_157|We don't just play golf in Scotland.
p301/p301_195|Harold is a rarity.
p301/p301_165|I am aware that somebody made a threat.
p301/p301_249|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p301/p301_372|His job was not advertised.
p301/p301_071|That's just the way the game is evolving.
p301/p301_108|Industry leaders reacted angrily.
p301/p301_190|Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
p301/p301_271|Bombing is the easy option.
p301/p301_323|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p301/p301_050|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p301/p301_196|Walk out the door and anything can happen.
p301/p301_077|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p301/p301_317|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p301/p301_043|Parts of the system are already overstretched.
p301/p301_113|The conversion didn't go over either.
p301/p301_208|We have no choice but to shut down.
p301/p301_145|It is patently true.
p301/p301_192|That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
p301/p301_393|McMaster had already seen the first part.
p301/p301_136|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p301/p301_056|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p301/p301_251|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p301/p301_033|However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
p301/p301_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p301/p301_326|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p301/p301_034|I kept my side of the bargain.
p301/p301_220|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p301/p301_299|That is the first job of the director - leadership.
p301/p301_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p301/p301_028|The law has got to be upheld.
p301/p301_282|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p301/p301_200|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p301/p301_163|This is a United Kingdom.
p301/p301_052|She is now planning a visit.
p301/p301_214|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p301/p301_085|I knew he would play two weeks ago.
p301/p301_242|There are nine people here now.
p301/p301_084|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p301/p301_058|The encounter was to change his life.
p301/p301_098|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p301/p301_359|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p301/p301_038|That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
p301/p301_090|We will learn lessons from what has happened.
p301/p301_215|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p301/p301_303|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p301/p301_221|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p301/p301_059|It's the best of both worlds.
p301/p301_232|That's the key issue isn't it?
p301/p301_115|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p301/p301_102|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p301/p301_030|He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
p301/p301_314|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p301/p301_074|The next thing will be cutting journey times.
p301/p301_344|We were lucky to have survived.
p301/p301_263|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p301/p301_121|The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
p301/p301_304|They tried to give her advice.
p301/p301_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p301/p301_235|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p301/p301_319|EMI is a prime example.
p301/p301_053|It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
p301/p301_375|He has changed my life for ever.
p301/p301_127|We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
p301/p301_048|I try not to expect anything.
p301/p301_254|The final stage is paranoia.
p301/p301_311|Both sides have to step back.
p301/p301_153|He was forced to quit.
p301/p301_378|There is no openness.
p301/p301_026|They changed the world of music.
p301/p301_212|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p301/p301_385|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p301/p301_191|We are seeking funds from government departments.
p301/p301_025|But it was a great decision he joked.
p301/p301_335|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p301/p301_312|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p301/p301_309|This fact is supported by audience research.
p301/p301_398|What other retailer would do this?
p301/p301_211|But he just carried on anyway.
p301/p301_086|The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
p301/p301_262|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p301/p301_252|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p301/p301_066|And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
p301/p301_051|It was, however, the wrong side.
p301/p301_223|I go home only once.
p301/p301_391|I had no qualms about it.
p301/p301_120|You do not change overnight.
p301/p301_333|They've been at it for five hours.
p301/p301_189|The role was perfect for Russell.
p301/p301_187|Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
p301/p301_155|I was loving that little girl.
p301/p301_083|Cars are great for going long distances.
p301/p301_111|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p301/p301_029|But we're not the same person.
p301/p301_343|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p301/p301_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p301/p301_142|We are both very confused and extremely angry.
p301/p301_117|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p301/p301_300|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p301/p301_079|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p301/p301_134|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p301/p301_366|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p301/p301_150|But it looks good for next year.
p301/p301_171|The problem arises because he does so much.
p301/p301_244|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p301/p301_237|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p301/p301_209|The prognosis is excellent.
p301/p301_130|We need to move forward together.
p301/p301_288|They had been together for about three years.
p301/p301_177|But is it ethical to practice in humans?
p301/p301_364|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p301/p301_401|I won't go back to Holland.
p301/p301_092|One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
p301/p301_236|I came up through the ranks.
p301/p301_307|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p301/p301_135|How good is Lennox Lewis?
p301/p301_399|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p301/p301_213|I would not want to be young again.
p301/p301_106|I think my game is suited to grass.
p301/p301_046|She added, It is the same story in both countries.
p301/p301_072|Michael is putting on a brave face.
p301/p301_289|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p301/p301_210|They always want to give a performance.
p301/p301_361|And that match was played in June.
p301/p301_261|We're not travel agents.
p301/p301_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p301/p301_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p301/p301_103|I am very sorry to be here.
p301/p301_243|His son is a local legend.
p301/p301_272|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p301/p301_397|Partition is not an option.
p301/p301_238|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p301/p301_055|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p301/p301_316|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p301/p301_377|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p301/p301_273|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p301/p301_362|He will address the nation this evening.
p301/p301_370|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p301/p301_308|They will have to make changes.
p301/p301_231|He said because people had invited him.
p301/p301_350|And Michael was just great.
p301/p301_096|We did not even get a free kick.
p301/p301_091|People love to see this stuff.
p301/p301_258|But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
p301/p301_199|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p301/p301_095|I have no plans to change the oath.
p301/p301_267|I do not own the vessel in question.
p301/p301_204|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p301/p301_345|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p301/p301_230|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p301/p301_219|What are you not good at?
p301/p301_067|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p301/p301_339|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p301/p301_240|The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
p301/p301_280|That nation is South Africa.
p301/p301_118|Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
p301/p301_194|I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
p301/p301_173|Our young people are leaving.
p301/p301_080|Ferguson did not hesitate.
p301/p301_374|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p301/p301_062|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p301/p301_365|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p301/p301_349|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p301/p301_313|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p301/p301_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p301/p301_193|He scored one goal and was on fire.
p301/p301_387|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p301/p301_104|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p301/p301_373|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p301/p301_119|It is not great art.
p301/p301_183|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p301/p301_078|He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
p301/p301_306|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p301/p301_331|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p301/p301_175|I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
p301/p301_069|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p301/p301_369|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p301/p301_185|You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
p301/p301_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p301/p301_357|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p301/p301_167|Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
p301/p301_367|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p301/p301_144|This was not just incongruous.
p301/p301_216|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p301/p301_259|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p301/p301_270|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p301/p301_380|It was a job he loved.
p301/p301_093|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p301/p301_302|Broke the birdie record.
p301/p301_277|Little Voice is on general release.
p301/p301_186|The early evidence suggests he did not.
p301/p301_298|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p301/p301_162|I understand the medical concerns.
p301/p301_250|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p301/p301_073|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p301/p301_260|That's the sort of game you want.
p301/p301_139|I'm very puzzled by it.
p301/p301_181|This does not create any precedent.
p301/p301_057|I keep my fingers crossed.
p301/p301_376|The home was now under new management.
p301/p301_049|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p301/p301_274|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p301/p301_337|His English counterpart agreed.
p301/p301_151|I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
p301/p301_197|I want him to take on Gomez.
p301/p301_285|It was an empowering journey.
p301/p301_239|These guys will not lie down.
p301/p301_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p301/p301_392|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p301/p301_036|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p301/p301_188|I hope you miss the cut.
p301/p301_332|I am not obsessed with sex.
p301/p301_217|They were later discharged from hospital.
p301/p301_027|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p301/p301_138|The son has autism and other problems.
p301/p301_045|It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
p301/p301_178|The big issue for us is the review.
p301/p301_166|However, who could have predicted this result?
p301/p301_294|Do you come from Moscow?
p301/p301_141|Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
p301/p301_061|That is why we want this decision reversed.
p301/p301_381|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p301/p301_064|We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
p301/p301_265|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p301/p301_268|Racism has no place in any sport.
p301/p301_354|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p301/p301_396|It was early morning.
p301/p301_202|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p301/p301_400|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p301/p301_101|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p301/p301_060|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p301/p301_409|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p301/p301_129|We now have to concentrate on the league.
p301/p301_099|Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
p301/p301_241|That is nearly four people every day.
p301/p301_152|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p301/p301_405|Whether this return was too soon.
p301/p301_161|There is no credible official announcement.
p301/p301_132|She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
p301/p301_180|I always loved the lightning in the movies.
p301/p301_116|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p301/p301_404|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p301/p301_290|Everything has been destroyed.
p301/p301_281|This will secure the future of our industry.
p301/p301_148|The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
p301/p301_206|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p301/p301_218|These findings would be made public.
p301/p301_410|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p301/p301_076|This is a mental challenge.
p301/p301_342|He's a joy to follow.
p301/p301_203|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p301/p301_227|The team this year is going places.
p301/p301_207|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p301/p301_147|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p301/p301_310|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p301/p301_351|He knew it would cost him millions.
p301/p301_122|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p301/p301_109|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p301/p301_054|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p301/p301_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p301/p301_146|You hope he prevails.
p301/p301_160|Before the game we went for a pint.
p301/p301_257|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p301/p301_407|My thoughts are with their families.
p301/p301_329|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p301/p301_047|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p301/p301_032|The punishment was swift.
p301/p301_356|We are now setting about finding them.
p301/p301_395|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p301/p301_379|It's being very carefully looked at.
p301/p301_089|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p301/p301_228|More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
p301/p301_324|A friendship that will endure.
p301/p301_044|Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
p301/p301_284|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p301/p301_318|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p301/p301_063|Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
p301/p301_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p301/p301_123|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p301/p301_275|I'd say we should give it a week.
p301/p301_169|They were behind the wheel.
p301/p301_247|He would just say it was terrible.
p301/p301_305|That it is a brand name.
p301/p301_276|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p301/p301_182|I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
p301/p301_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p301/p301_040|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p301/p301_222|This makes no sense!
p301/p301_355|That only came out during a radio interview.
p301/p301_325|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p301/p301_087|It has never been worthwhile.
p301/p301_327|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p301/p301_164|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p301/p301_358|We must not go down that road.
p301/p301_159|The death toll included five children.
p301/p301_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p301/p301_114|He took away my childhood.
p301/p301_158|That's why the young musicians have joined.
p301/p301_198|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p301/p301_293|We just want to get stuck in now.
p301/p301_269|I am not happy with proposals for widows.
p301/p301_088|So other options had to be explored.
p301/p301_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p301/p301_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p301/p301_279|There is no substitute.
p301/p301_406|Jackson may well be right.
p301/p301_105|Is your life a little too easy?
p301/p301_403|There was no cohesion.
p301/p301_286|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p301/p301_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p301/p301_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p301/p301_137|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p301/p301_248|This is the New Edinburgh.
p301/p301_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p301/p301_143|All things are possible if you believe.
p301/p301_070|When he took over it really took off.
p301/p301_100|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p301/p301_133|Both were later released after a check-up.
p301/p301_253|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p301/p301_168|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p301/p301_107|The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
p293/p293_378|It is three years at present.
p293/p293_309|That suggests that out fitness is good.
p293/p293_188|But Allen is deadly serious.
p293/p293_208|His conclusion is upbeat.
p293/p293_074|We've had our problems at the club.
p293/p293_237|That was my own personal decision.
p293/p293_037|I have got to adopt the same approach.
p293/p293_046|Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
p293/p293_283|The whole process was so different.
p293/p293_216|A web site's planned for November.
p293/p293_315|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p293/p293_234|It's a way of making a mark.
p293/p293_288|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
p293/p293_039|It's a sensible management decision.
p293/p293_060|But the foundations have been laid.
p293/p293_047|That was the theory, anyway.
p293/p293_345|The package has been properly costed.
p293/p293_221|It will take some time to establish.
p293/p293_248|But one shouldn't go by that.
p293/p293_108|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p293/p293_100|You do have a way out.
p293/p293_222|Sadly the jury were not convinced.
p293/p293_314|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p293/p293_228|These will be finally corrected by next week.
p293/p293_081|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p293/p293_077|We also hope to meet the men.
p293/p293_185|This is the stuff of live music.
p293/p293_284|The BBC was a disgrace.
p293/p293_086|Self control is just one instalment.
p293/p293_088|I could not believe what they were saying.
p293/p293_163|Politics is a tough game.
p293/p293_287|They certainly do not socialise.
p293/p293_162|However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
p293/p293_207|He was also married with two children.
p293/p293_160|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p293/p293_069|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p293/p293_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p293/p293_030|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p293/p293_118|These are long-term investments.
p293/p293_381|When he took over it really took off.
p293/p293_129|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p293/p293_218|The salary changes are long overdue.
p293/p293_259|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p293/p293_396|I should never have come over to Fife.
p293/p293_308|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p293/p293_096|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p293/p293_373|But it was to no avail.
p293/p293_236|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p293/p293_187|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p293/p293_073|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p293/p293_061|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p293/p293_261|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p293/p293_310|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p293/p293_367|Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
p293/p293_126|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p293/p293_026|Theatre is not a museum.
p293/p293_084|However, it's good to turn the page.
p293/p293_375|The whole experience has left me bitter.
p293/p293_143|The proposals were never taken seriously.
p293/p293_087|It's an hour of the same response.
p293/p293_329|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p293/p293_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p293/p293_282|We very much regret that it has occurred.
p293/p293_098|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p293/p293_052|It is a large number.
p293/p293_281|I was living with my mum.
p293/p293_249|Nobody has been put on trial.
p293/p293_326|It possibly depends on the position.
p293/p293_398|Their bid was a very good one.
p293/p293_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p293/p293_094|We've been overwhelmed by the response.
p293/p293_115|The door is open.
p293/p293_245|We live by the rule of law.
p293/p293_159|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p293/p293_394|She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
p293/p293_258|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p293/p293_335|They had asked not to be named.
p293/p293_171|At this point we can only speculate.
p293/p293_210|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p293/p293_035|There is a lot of heroin about.
p293/p293_290|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p293/p293_215|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p293/p293_117|She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
p293/p293_170|We are concerned that things should be safe.
p293/p293_161|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p293/p293_149|We had to take action to protect them.
p293/p293_219|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p293/p293_246|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p293/p293_372|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p293/p293_091|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p293/p293_150|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p293/p293_186|Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
p293/p293_029|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p293/p293_134|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p293/p293_342|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p293/p293_189|It's a huge amount.
p293/p293_090|Will he be given time?
p293/p293_349|The family also declined to discuss the case.
p293/p293_324|I bought a car at auction.
p293/p293_103|These guys are looking for business.
p293/p293_048|Ferguson must take the blame.
p293/p293_377|This must be kept in total perspective.
p293/p293_255|In short, the club was broke.
p293/p293_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p293/p293_166|It is physical but it is also good.
p293/p293_327|Life is too short.
p293/p293_328|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p293/p293_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p293/p293_142|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p293/p293_195|We will do so again.
p293/p293_051|Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
p293/p293_352|Barry will be able to handle this.
p293/p293_038|Seven people were later detained by police.
p293/p293_165|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p293/p293_212|I'm just gonna hit the shot.
p293/p293_197|I'm a bit annoyed.
p293/p293_274|There are two offerings from Scotland.
p293/p293_225|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p293/p293_233|They had four children together.
p293/p293_397|What kind of person is he?
p293/p293_300|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p293/p293_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p293/p293_227|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p293/p293_250|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p293/p293_271|I was furious about it.
p293/p293_106|It was different in the endurance events.
p293/p293_239|She returned home a few days later.
p293/p293_119|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p293/p293_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p293/p293_292|We told them in June.
p293/p293_199|I am just looking to God.
p293/p293_192|But he is something special, is he not?
p293/p293_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p293/p293_114|You, the British people, are the boss.
p293/p293_146|Perhaps it should stay there.
p293/p293_238|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p293/p293_041|I would just like someone to confess.
p293/p293_380|As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
p293/p293_323|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p293/p293_082|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p293/p293_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p293/p293_080|Sometimes they come off.
p293/p293_362|I now know that from memory.
p293/p293_387|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p293/p293_056|That is our unfinished business.
p293/p293_385|It was even worse than at home.
p293/p293_369|I don't know what we're doing wrong.
p293/p293_312|The British public is nothing if not fickle.
p293/p293_338|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p293/p293_379|My husband was fighting for his life.
p293/p293_376|It is not a road of life.
p293/p293_240|I have been here for only three months.
p293/p293_366|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p293/p293_304|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p293/p293_121|This is excellent news for Glasgow.
p293/p293_359|The initial reaction was disbelief.
p293/p293_201|What's the rush?
p293/p293_191|So he was anxious to try something new.
p293/p293_209|Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
p293/p293_321|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p293/p293_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p293/p293_124|You ask the question.
p293/p293_217|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p293/p293_400|And this tournament will travel.
p293/p293_316|Last year, however, was a different story.
p293/p293_133|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p293/p293_154|It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p293/p293_392|The aircraft was totally destroyed.
p293/p293_125|Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
p293/p293_278|This avalanche is just beginning.
p293/p293_079|All the people thought that we would die.
p293/p293_273|It is typical of me.
p293/p293_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p293/p293_214|The replacements made a big difference.
p293/p293_054|General, You didn't get a modified.
p293/p293_279|That, however, is only part of their story.
p293/p293_388|I am sure that this will happen again.
p293/p293_064|Why did it take a concerted campaign?
p293/p293_357|We're very excited and challenged by the project.
p293/p293_243|How can they engage with the work?
p293/p293_157|Horses have some sense.
p293/p293_211|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p293/p293_001|Please call Stella.
p293/p293_151|Our policy is clear.
p293/p293_334|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p293/p293_028|All my training is for Athens.
p293/p293_382|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p293/p293_050|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p293/p293_043|We can be proud of our achievements.
p293/p293_289|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p293/p293_260|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p293/p293_263|It feels like a privilege.
p293/p293_109|The objective was achieved.
p293/p293_277|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p293/p293_355|But it can happen for Tiger.
p293/p293_155|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p293/p293_136|That is why we are here.
p293/p293_034|I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
p293/p293_265|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p293/p293_268|Our children are our future.
p293/p293_203|Nothing is ruled out.
p293/p293_399|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p293/p293_076|More than half of the school collapsed.
p293/p293_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p293/p293_145|The same goes for McKenna.
p293/p293_112|There is no musical background in his family.
p293/p293_059|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p293/p293_055|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p293/p293_122|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p293/p293_343|It raises a serious question mark.
p293/p293_085|There are plenty examples.
p293/p293_070|I was shaking on the blocks.
p293/p293_036|There is a growing anger among the group.
p293/p293_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p293/p293_174|The people here are quite reserved.
p293/p293_347|The feeling is awesome.
p293/p293_107|They will now have to justify their position.
p293/p293_360|All these things have an impact.
p293/p293_264|We have got a full house tonight.
p293/p293_040|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p293/p293_116|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p293/p293_356|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p293/p293_137|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p293/p293_344|He is dying from cancer.
p293/p293_384|I have chosen to do this research.
p293/p293_063|He had other things on his mind.
p293/p293_226|They have to come up with a solution.
p293/p293_363|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p293/p293_152|I think we have a very strong case.
p293/p293_339|They would love to do more films.
p293/p293_172|Family members are at her bedside.
p293/p293_196|We will only move forward.
p293/p293_220|Who would be in that desert?
p293/p293_178|This gives us a lot of practice.
p293/p293_078|I can live with just the one.
p293/p293_276|I know you went back this morning.
p293/p293_358|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p293/p293_183|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p293/p293_313|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p293/p293_247|She is fulfilled by it.
p293/p293_177|It's been such a long haul.
p293/p293_386|Michael's putting on a brave face.
p293/p293_330|He's very young but he is growing up.
p293/p293_045|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p293/p293_113|The cost of war is more than that.
p293/p293_111|Look at his last couple of records.
p293/p293_311|Four had been brought down.
p293/p293_127|The Taliban response was swift.
p293/p293_371|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p293/p293_241|So what's wrong with Scotland?
p293/p293_105|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p293/p293_164|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p293/p293_135|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p293/p293_066|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p293/p293_322|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p293/p293_251|Also, he was flawed.
p293/p293_093|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p293/p293_253|I just could not cope.
p293/p293_368|The men are safe and unharmed.
p293/p293_169|I just want to enjoy myself.
p293/p293_075|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p293/p293_294|They never gave up hope.
p293/p293_202|It would also take time.
p293/p293_229|They will form a tribute.
p293/p293_348|He quit in October.
p293/p293_138|Somehow they got out.
p293/p293_097|It has been hijacked.
p293/p293_298|The red card was okay.
p293/p293_354|Failure is a curious concept.
p293/p293_286|I don't know why she is not here.
p293/p293_065|Let us hope so.
p293/p293_272|They were not doing it too well, either.
p293/p293_317|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p293/p293_153|Who would be out there, singing?
p293/p293_057|This is far too high.
p293/p293_184|It was his job to check.
p293/p293_361|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p293/p293_175|When will this change?
p293/p293_053|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p293/p293_092|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p293/p293_181|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p293/p293_257|There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
p293/p293_148|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p293/p293_200|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p293/p293_346|The attitude and commitment was decent.
p293/p293_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p293/p293_370|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p293/p293_256|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p293/p293_389|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p293/p293_128|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p293/p293_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p293/p293_204|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p293/p293_295|Construction is due to begin in February.
p293/p293_176|It has made me feel good.
p293/p293_156|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p293/p293_095|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p293/p293_072|You see, my back has gone.
p293/p293_350|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p293/p293_332|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p293/p293_331|He is in charge on the pitch.
p293/p293_305|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p293/p293_336|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p293/p293_071|So the challenge is against ourselves.
p293/p293_027|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p293/p293_303|There will be no disruption to teaching.
p293/p293_297|It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
p293/p293_190|The fire was falling from the sky.
p293/p293_067|A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
p293/p293_231|I think in three dimensions.
p293/p293_320|Eleven events are required.
p293/p293_364|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p293/p293_194|A final decision is expected by Friday.
p293/p293_205|He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
p293/p293_083|However, my position remains the same.
p293/p293_224|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p293/p293_269|It's part of your life.
p293/p293_244|It gave me something to focus on.
p293/p293_042|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p293/p293_390|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p293/p293_182|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p293/p293_270|The defender made an impressive debut.
p293/p293_123|Eriksson would have approved.
p293/p293_179|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p293/p293_341|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p293/p293_302|It will vote with the US.
p293/p293_193|This is simply unjust.
p293/p293_333|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p293/p293_393|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p293/p293_120|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p293/p293_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p293/p293_089|A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
p293/p293_132|The firm was down and almost out.
p293/p293_213|He will not be carrying out any surgery.
p293/p293_032|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p293/p293_025|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p293/p293_144|The Treasury denied the claims.
p293/p293_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p293/p293_306|Again the verdict was not proven.
p293/p293_058|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p293/p293_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p293/p293_242|She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
p293/p293_068|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p293/p293_167|It's unfair on her.
p293/p293_307|We've just got to work a bit better.
p293/p293_168|So, easy does it.
p293/p293_252|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p293/p293_391|I do not believe they are.
p293/p293_383|The penalty was the turning point.
p293/p293_101|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p293/p293_301|But they will not be compelled to join.
p293/p293_173|I am very shocked.
p293/p293_033|Several others were absent.
p293/p293_374|I don't think the referees are against us.
p293/p293_266|He will be advised by me.
p293/p293_291|He had played well in that central role.
p293/p293_293|If so, we want to hear from them.
p293/p293_044|Clark is back on top form.
p293/p293_206|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p293/p293_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p293/p293_254|They may differ on other issues.
p293/p293_102|This is not a European Army.
p293/p293_131|Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
p293/p293_275|Life becomes a song.
p293/p293_147|You can be sure we will have problems.
p293/p293_319|Frankly, they have to crack down.
p293/p293_049|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p293/p293_262|The Commons is too outdated.
p293/p293_232|Three others were wounded.
p293/p293_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p293/p293_351|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p293/p293_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p293/p293_285|They feel it belongs to them.
p293/p293_158|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p293/p293_280|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p293/p293_340|I have great sympathy with these people.
p293/p293_104|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p293/p293_139|The house was so well alight.
p293/p293_296|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p293/p293_230|We had no idea that this letter existed.
p293/p293_062|So they will settle again.
p293/p293_223|We never got off the bus.
p293/p293_365|He doesn't even know who he is.
p293/p293_395|This is a completely new experience for me.
p293/p293_180|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p293/p293_337|A whole range of factors are involved.
p293/p293_141|Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
p293/p293_110|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p293/p293_130|They have their own interests and techniques.
p293/p293_325|You've gotten all the facts.
p293/p293_140|I've been very nervous.
p293/p293_235|There is a great carry over value.
p293/p293_267|It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
p293/p293_198|It ignores the future.
p293/p293_099|They must put them back.
p293/p293_318|Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
p293/p293_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p248/p248_092|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p248/p248_078|Today she has been released.
p248/p248_188|What has caused the demise of singing?
p248/p248_307|It should be equal.
p248/p248_179|Tony had arrived.
p248/p248_178|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p248/p248_130|I had relied on him.
p248/p248_329|He has to learn.
p248/p248_361|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p248/p248_343|It is horrible.
p248/p248_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p248/p248_082|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p248/p248_311|Other people had looked at it.
p248/p248_159|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p248/p248_141|He has the edge.
p248/p248_086|It's never too late.
p248/p248_218|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p248/p248_157|They should stop the bombing.
p248/p248_333|I said that I had been raped.
p248/p248_172|They thought they had found a home.
p248/p248_287|It is not normal practice.
p248/p248_301|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p248/p248_041|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p248/p248_196|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p248/p248_248|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p248/p248_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p248/p248_310|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p248/p248_244|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p248/p248_257|They are real.
p248/p248_131|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p248/p248_079|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p248/p248_149|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p248/p248_368|Five members were disciplined.
p248/p248_072|Then followed a bout of flu.
p248/p248_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p248/p248_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p248/p248_360|He could face a jail sentence.
p248/p248_167|We have a budget in March.
p248/p248_108|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p248/p248_152|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p248/p248_074|I had my suspicions.
p248/p248_096|It is a delight on every level.
p248/p248_366|It is legally binding.
p248/p248_038|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p248/p248_293|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p248/p248_106|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p248/p248_166|It's that sort of night.
p248/p248_189|You know the sort of thing.
p248/p248_162|It has to be now.
p248/p248_198|It was still there, but right at the end.
p248/p248_193|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p248/p248_069|Have a look at our accounts.
p248/p248_134|Our intentions are real.
p248/p248_330|Indeed, it was magical.
p248/p248_148|It is like a football team.
p248/p248_161|Eight months later, he was dead.
p248/p248_246|The scene is about this?
p248/p248_049|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p248/p248_335|The composer will conduct.
p248/p248_192|All options are open.
p248/p248_356|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p248/p248_354|It was that bad, that low.
p248/p248_250|It was a hit.
p248/p248_107|He pleaded for caution.
p248/p248_315|Donald was his friend.
p248/p248_197|It's the same old story.
p248/p248_309|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p248/p248_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p248/p248_216|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p248/p248_298|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p248/p248_124|I can't even get into the A team.
p248/p248_083|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p248/p248_098|Two of the team became ill.
p248/p248_071|There was an e-mail.
p248/p248_344|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p248/p248_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p248/p248_226|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p248/p248_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p248/p248_026|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p248/p248_037|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p248/p248_059|It will take time.
p248/p248_093|He was possessed
p248/p248_029|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p248/p248_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p248/p248_073|Neither it is.
p248/p248_321|Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
p248/p248_345|I kept going for her.
p248/p248_043|It was ugly.
p248/p248_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p248/p248_144|He is severe.
p248/p248_288|The release attracted little attention.
p248/p248_357|Who was the mystery MP?
p248/p248_054|They had to explain it.
p248/p248_062|Four other charges were dropped.
p248/p248_364|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p248/p248_158|That's the name of the game, though.
p248/p248_151|It is huge.
p248/p248_234|They should come forward.
p248/p248_181|The goals were good.
p248/p248_239|It is no surprise.
p248/p248_254|We run within the law.
p248/p248_303|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p248/p248_056|But the law is very clear on this.
p248/p248_146|This film will be totally awesome.
p248/p248_077|It is a time bomb.
p248/p248_155|They were later discharged from hospital.
p248/p248_316|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p248/p248_362|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p248/p248_275|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p248/p248_055|Here's a clue.
p248/p248_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p248/p248_205|It was worth a photograph.
p248/p248_332|It will be very, very tight.
p248/p248_090|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p248/p248_183|Four policemen were wounded.
p248/p248_283|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p248/p248_122|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p248/p248_210|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p248/p248_299|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p248/p248_291|What has altered?
p248/p248_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p248/p248_286|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p248/p248_269|Immediate action must be taken.
p248/p248_140|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p248/p248_209|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p248/p248_268|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p248/p248_182|I've been there.
p248/p248_372|Colour was at the core of his life.
p248/p248_272|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p248/p248_331|There's no place to hide.
p248/p248_328|You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
p248/p248_212|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p248/p248_270|He is a young man with a new deal.
p248/p248_160|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p248/p248_195|It wasn't to be.
p248/p248_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p248/p248_138|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p248/p248_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p248/p248_097|I had a ball today.
p248/p248_308|Craig is a major concern for us.
p248/p248_125|She does not want to speak.
p248/p248_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p248/p248_220|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p248/p248_318|I saw some good things.
p248/p248_156|That includes the equipment?
p248/p248_206|We have an election in eight days.
p248/p248_238|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p248/p248_300|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p248/p248_143|It's a crucial award.
p248/p248_313|Off with their heads.
p248/p248_087|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p248/p248_187|They need to look after themselves.
p248/p248_336|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p248/p248_342|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p248/p248_139|It was typical.
p248/p248_215|In each case they were a goal down.
p248/p248_280|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p248/p248_304|We have waited a long time for this.
p248/p248_052|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p248/p248_326|This is the way things should be handled.
p248/p248_295|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p248/p248_339|It's the last thing on my mind.
p248/p248_117|Maybe this battle has been.
p248/p248_068|It's good news and long overdue.
p248/p248_225|I have spoken to the skipper.
p248/p248_213|Twaddle is a case in point.
p248/p248_034|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p248/p248_028|That's no bad thing.
p248/p248_111|We do not expect any surplus.
p248/p248_350|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p248/p248_232|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p248/p248_281|He will address the nation this evening.
p248/p248_317|He was unable to come.
p248/p248_221|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p248/p248_337|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p248/p248_322|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p248/p248_191|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p248/p248_070|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p248/p248_256|they fail to engage.
p248/p248_089|They lived for their children.
p248/p248_101|That time is not now, however.
p248/p248_147|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p248/p248_084|We have other options.
p248/p248_358|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p248/p248_085|By then, he was walking on water.
p248/p248_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p248/p248_363|They have not done so this season so far.
p248/p248_290|IT S all in the hair.
p248/p248_371|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p248/p248_112|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p248/p248_233|It is set in Paris.
p248/p248_067|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p248/p248_163|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p248/p248_199|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p248/p248_349|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p248/p248_114|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p248/p248_126|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p248/p248_104|That is no use.
p248/p248_110|It had been played at festivals.
p248/p248_103|I didn't play well last year.
p248/p248_099|That's all right then.
p248/p248_066|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p248/p248_214|It had all been arranged.
p248/p248_236|It's very safe.
p248/p248_227|The track is currently covered in snow.
p248/p248_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p248/p248_277|He looked very sharp.
p248/p248_355|That would help.
p248/p248_219|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p248/p248_173|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p248/p248_255|Kirkwood was arrested.
p248/p248_324|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p248/p248_051|But it might have done.
p248/p248_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p248/p248_184|They receive a high profile in the media.
p248/p248_120|They've got to account for it.
p248/p248_057|Next league matches Celtic.
p248/p248_095|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p248/p248_202|But she might be.
p248/p248_165|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p248/p248_061|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p248/p248_223|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p248/p248_249|It was a cry for help.
p248/p248_039|It was clear.
p248/p248_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p248/p248_222|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p248/p248_201|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p248/p248_027|But it failed.
p248/p248_319|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p248/p248_365|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p248/p248_137|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p248/p248_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p248/p248_169|The post will be unpaid.
p248/p248_044|That is a break with tradition.
p248/p248_302|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p248/p248_347|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p248/p248_251|This year I understood.
p248/p248_186|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p248/p248_285|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p248/p248_032|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p248/p248_325|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p248/p248_154|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p248/p248_235|I haven't made the donation yet.
p248/p248_185|We did everything by the book.
p248/p248_094|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p248/p248_030|I have a theory.
p248/p248_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p248/p248_375|The casualties were not named.
p248/p248_258|They must play for each other.
p248/p248_081|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p248/p248_047|It is urgent.
p248/p248_033|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p248/p248_135|Government will intervene.
p248/p248_127|So the European elections are extremely important.
p248/p248_123|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p248/p248_175|Blair's response was weak.
p248/p248_204|Today was first class.
p248/p248_048|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p248/p248_046|No meaningful response was issued.
p248/p248_058|It's very odd.
p248/p248_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p248/p248_292|I thought it was my only chance.
p248/p248_278|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p248/p248_088|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p248/p248_132|It's the big omission.
p248/p248_353|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p248/p248_323|Who will do it?
p248/p248_264|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p248/p248_230|It's the same as Glasgow.
p248/p248_035|I expected these kind of questions.
p248/p248_241|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p248/p248_036|It's a matter of balance.
p248/p248_224|It was good fun.
p248/p248_265|This is a question of Islam.
p248/p248_242|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p248/p248_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p248/p248_190|I cannot say too much about them.
p248/p248_053|He looks like an Afghan.
p248/p248_109|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p248/p248_065|Scotland had great assets.
p248/p248_359|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p248/p248_207|Now, it's all right.
p248/p248_367|Well, the big day has arrived.
p248/p248_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p248/p248_142|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p248/p248_263|He will emerge as a world leader.
p248/p248_267|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p248/p248_320|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p248/p248_118|But the fans deserve to know!
p248/p248_228|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p248/p248_200|The service from the other players was super.
p248/p248_305|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p248/p248_334|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p248/p248_170|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p248/p248_252|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p248/p248_271|He was also married with two children.
p248/p248_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p248/p248_373|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p248/p248_247|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p248/p248_001|Please call Stella.
p248/p248_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p248/p248_327|The train was on time.
p248/p248_245|It is hard won.
p248/p248_063|It is not great art.
p248/p248_243|She is well balanced.
p248/p248_129|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p248/p248_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p248/p248_274|I feel pretty good.
p248/p248_076|It works for us.
p248/p248_341|I'd like to take the plunge.
p248/p248_279|You've got to have both sides.
p248/p248_203|It's just awful.
p248/p248_113|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p248/p248_136|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p248/p248_289|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p248/p248_351|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p248/p248_240|My future is in the marathon.
p248/p248_042|I was scared.
p248/p248_177|And I saw the light!
p248/p248_260|It is also very valuable.
p248/p248_075|He got the same story.
p248/p248_346|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p248/p248_064|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p248/p248_276|If not, he should go home.
p248/p248_282|It was a virus.
p248/p248_102|Oil embargo endorsed.
p248/p248_119|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p248/p248_273|It's a way of life.
p248/p248_306|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p248/p248_180|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p248/p248_133|It plans to return to this field.
p248/p248_338|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p248/p248_050|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p248/p248_294|Our task is to complete the picture.
p248/p248_194|However, this idea is never developed.
p248/p248_105|That all hope is never lost.
p248/p248_153|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p248/p248_229|At the time, he was a living legend.
p248/p248_374|He's a lovely young man.
p248/p248_261|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p248/p248_150|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p248/p248_296|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p248/p248_369|There is no signature.
p248/p248_145|There is a lack of chemistry.
p248/p248_100|That would be unlawful.
p248/p248_128|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p248/p248_208|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p248/p248_174|The jury is still out.
p248/p248_297|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p248/p248_262|That is highly unfair.
p248/p248_091|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p248/p248_115|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p248/p248_312|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p248/p248_045|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p248/p248_176|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p248/p248_171|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p248/p248_031|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p248/p248_348|But nothing happened.
p248/p248_314|The parents will have a great time, too.
p248/p248_253|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p248/p248_116|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p248/p248_352|He has seen the past.
p248/p248_370|I am a wealthy person.
p248/p248_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p248/p248_231|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p248/p248_340|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p248/p248_266|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p248/p248_164|I was in the train station overnight.
p248/p248_217|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p248/p248_121|She's got to say something.
p248/p248_080|It may well have been.
p248/p248_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p248/p248_060|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p248/p248_284|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p248/p248_211|He is slightly confused.
p248/p248_376|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p267/p267_074|That is bound to happen.
p267/p267_203|There is no quick fix.
p267/p267_364|There may be reasons for it.
p267/p267_090|Before the game we went for a pint.
p267/p267_038|This represents a tough game for us.
p267/p267_391|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p267/p267_139|It has to be an event.
p267/p267_302|I am a retailer by nature.
p267/p267_399|That's all I can say.
p267/p267_311|We will make a statement tomorrow.
p267/p267_389|It was a funny game.
p267/p267_106|I was always a little behind.
p267/p267_029|Because we do not need it.
p267/p267_160|Nobody did in those days.
p267/p267_263|It was the climax of the thing.
p267/p267_057|That way I won't have to do anything.
p267/p267_026|He may not need to force that message.
p267/p267_226|What are you not good at?
p267/p267_197|Tommy is not a problem.
p267/p267_265|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p267/p267_120|You've got to be vigilant.
p267/p267_182|A team is a team.
p267/p267_394|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p267/p267_342|It is a strong case.
p267/p267_291|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p267/p267_039|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p267/p267_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p267/p267_286|And they were being paid?
p267/p267_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p267/p267_232|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p267/p267_256|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p267/p267_113|What do we do?
p267/p267_409|I'm pleased about one thing.
p267/p267_285|That goes back a long way.
p267/p267_381|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p267/p267_183|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p267/p267_086|They need to find a form of words.
p267/p267_148|There was a definite prejudice.
p267/p267_343|A report is expected next month.
p267/p267_059|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p267/p267_293|We have a plan in place.
p267/p267_125|They could use a boost.
p267/p267_320|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p267/p267_102|Such actions are rarely popular.
p267/p267_181|It is a common problem.
p267/p267_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p267/p267_237|She died in middle age.
p267/p267_236|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p267/p267_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p267/p267_317|I am not concerned with protection of the public.
p267/p267_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p267/p267_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p267/p267_290|Stephen will get his first cap.
p267/p267_031|This is a central issue.

p267/p267_359|We live on an island.
p267/p267_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p267/p267_289|Do I think about them often?
p267/p267_143|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.

p267/p267_116|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p267/p267_346|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p267/p267_080|It's so hard to shift.
p267/p267_124|It would make a lot of sense.

p267/p267_420|I've got my own ideas.
p267/p267_053|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p267/p267_072|A government is a government is a government.
p267/p267_365|This is a major championship.
p267/p267_296|He wants to talk a lot.
p267/p267_251|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.

p267/p267_314|I will not be afraid.
p267/p267_307|It is a potential danger.
p267/p267_159|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p267/p267_136|It has become a way of life.
p267/p267_030|We will look into it.
p267/p267_131|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p267/p267_164|Had I heard?
p267/p267_104|Then again, we could have.
p267/p267_100|They will notice a difference.
p267/p267_111|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p267/p267_355|He did a good job.
p267/p267_408|We will stand for the nation.
p267/p267_386|We have made no final decisions.
p267/p267_048|There was no safety net.
p267/p267_036|A week is a long time in politics.
p267/p267_380|We operate as a Scottish company.
p267/p267_042|He is too weak to move.
p267/p267_176|He played it like a veteran.
p267/p267_417|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p267/p267_282|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p267/p267_248|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p267/p267_370|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p267/p267_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p267/p267_097|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p267/p267_414|These guys are looking for business.
p267/p267_156|Seven people were later detained by police.
p267/p267_172|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p267/p267_361|They have created a business.
p267/p267_295|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p267/p267_279|He has run a hell of a race.
p267/p267_318|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p267/p267_266|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p267/p267_308|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p267/p267_063|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p267/p267_066|Do I have a favourite?
p267/p267_184|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p267/p267_221|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p267/p267_088|It's for that reason he should resign.
p267/p267_037|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p267/p267_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p267/p267_150|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p267/p267_412|My aim is a top six finish.
p267/p267_126|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p267/p267_055|So I liked the challenge.
p267/p267_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p267/p267_379|In fact, he was great today.
p267/p267_028|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p267/p267_043|Everything else is a bonus.
p267/p267_123|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p267/p267_189|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p267/p267_250|It seems a waste of talents.
p267/p267_212|My life is in the ballet.
p267/p267_382|A review is under way.
p267/p267_350|I have a moral dilemma.
p267/p267_162|And does it?
p267/p267_413|Such an attack is bizarre.
p267/p267_322|We want to play at the worlds.
p267/p267_099|We need to handle it.
p267/p267_044|This is the interesting part.
p267/p267_129|He was seen as the enemy.
p267/p267_050|It is a different animal.
p267/p267_177|I have spoken to head office.
p267/p267_076|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p267/p267_284|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p267/p267_200|I won't make an official complaint.
p267/p267_195|I suggest a new plan.
p267/p267_407|None of the agencies was able to help.
p267/p267_052|I must take a seat.
p267/p267_205|It has been like that all year for me.
p267/p267_340|Do you think we are a top nation?
p267/p267_403|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p267/p267_107|There were no grounds for his action.
p267/p267_278|It is set in Paris.
p267/p267_095|That means an extra two years.
p267/p267_078|He can win every week.
p267/p267_321|He has been told by the doctor to rest.
p267/p267_141|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p267/p267_404|You thought it was a headache.
p267/p267_056|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p267/p267_303|Well, he can do it.
p267/p267_185|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p267/p267_300|It's difficult to predict the future.
p267/p267_369|There is no deal as yet.
p267/p267_170|They made such decisions in London.
p267/p267_115|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p267/p267_384|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p267/p267_211|I'm just a regular person.
p267/p267_261|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p267/p267_255|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p267/p267_327|You are looking at him.
p267/p267_401|What are they for?
p267/p267_083|There was no way back for United after that.
p267/p267_220|Because they didn't want to know.
p267/p267_109|We have a training class.
p267/p267_411|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p267/p267_089|The rescue package is public money.
p267/p267_214|They're going to open in early summer.
p267/p267_323|After some discussion they did.
p267/p267_178|The referee had a good game.
p267/p267_372|The pair are very much in love.
p267/p267_335|But the New Year was special.
p267/p267_060|We need to increase the membership.
p267/p267_419|It needs to be volatile.
p267/p267_215|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p267/p267_270|It is also very valuable.
p267/p267_339|Did it work?
p267/p267_174|It is not a threat.
p267/p267_193|If I was a woman.
p267/p267_092|They were a lovely couple.
p267/p267_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p267/p267_252|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p267/p267_207|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p267/p267_360|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p267/p267_225|how do you get it back?
p267/p267_121|Tiger is not the norm.
p267/p267_313|You will never get a conviction.
p267/p267_161|So what is the campaign about?
p267/p267_173|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p267/p267_166|It's nice to be nice.
p267/p267_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p267/p267_395|We shall not be moved.
p267/p267_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p267/p267_357|It is a stroke of genius.
p267/p267_396|I watch the other visitors.
p267/p267_406|I thought he was an animal.
p267/p267_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p267/p267_331|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p267/p267_081|They lived for their children.
p267/p267_175|I would not count on it.
p267/p267_142|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p267/p267_333|It makes a compelling display.
p267/p267_140|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p267/p267_373|They are used to the big stage.
p267/p267_347|He was then replaced by Ross.
p267/p267_305|The judge was really nice.
p267/p267_258|They were back in full training yesterday.
p267/p267_155|We came across the first set of bodies.
p267/p267_084|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p267/p267_041|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p267/p267_275|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p267/p267_202|It is an impressive record.
p267/p267_352|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p267/p267_367|She is now on the back benches.
p267/p267_027|There is no reason at all.
p267/p267_128|They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
p267/p267_147|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p267/p267_260|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p267/p267_130|That group reported just before Christmas.
p267/p267_135|So I got a blood test.
p267/p267_180|They need to look after themselves.
p267/p267_079|By then, he was walking on water.
p267/p267_149|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p267/p267_244|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p267/p267_168|I always felt they played for me.
p267/p267_157|I would probably have to agree with him.
p267/p267_349|He is not very big, either.
p267/p267_152|That is not too bad.
p267/p267_363|I am considered a teenager.
p267/p267_187|People will ask about us.
p267/p267_416|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p267/p267_415|He is on the wrong side.
p267/p267_093|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p267/p267_283|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p267/p267_354|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p267/p267_167|The people are the hero.
p267/p267_259|No production contract is yet in sight.
p267/p267_269|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p267/p267_306|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p267/p267_390|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p267/p267_234|And he goes with it.
p267/p267_190|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p267/p267_298|It is inherent in society.
p267/p267_246|It is a court case.
p267/p267_309|Cast Away now on general release.
p267/p267_344|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p267/p267_105|She's got to say something.
p267/p267_073|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p267/p267_368|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p267/p267_094|It's not a lack of effort.
p267/p267_345|They were the acts of men.
p267/p267_064|How are you, sir?
p267/p267_192|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p267/p267_087|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p267/p267_245|I am still waiting for a reply.
p267/p267_117|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p267/p267_235|They tried to give her advice.
p267/p267_337|There was no time scale.
p267/p267_067|There could be a way back.
p267/p267_330|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p267/p267_134|I am just trying to do my job.
p267/p267_075|He is in the queue.
p267/p267_287|was everything done to save people?
p267/p267_049|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p267/p267_032|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p267/p267_294|I felt like I was a child.
p267/p267_242|It is the loss of my name.
p267/p267_332|The problems began a long time ago.
p267/p267_198|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p267/p267_240|You will have seen the adverts.
p267/p267_348|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p267/p267_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p267/p267_316|He has left the company.
p267/p267_247|He has been a success this year.
p267/p267_171|It is a body blow.
p267/p267_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p267/p267_264|I can't get a job.
p267/p267_224|Does the name matter?
p267/p267_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p267/p267_366|It's only a matter of scale.
p267/p267_096|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p267/p267_051|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p267/p267_077|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p267/p267_127|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p267/p267_312|There were no passengers on board.
p267/p267_268|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p267/p267_137|I was caught out a little bit.
p267/p267_219|Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
p267/p267_233|My wife and family are the support system.
p267/p267_146|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p267/p267_405|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p267/p267_213|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p267/p267_208|From there, they can go anywhere.
p267/p267_110|Well, you can have a tree.
p267/p267_356|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p267/p267_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p267/p267_329|It's not an easy life.
p267/p267_163|Are you from the rugby?
p267/p267_398|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p267/p267_400|Are they free?
p267/p267_223|What do we want to do that for?
p267/p267_334|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p267/p267_328|This is a source of real concern for the area.
p267/p267_091|Our house was very small.
p227/p227_029|This is a central issue.
p227/p227_094|Their attitude is all wrong.
p227/p227_152|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p227/p227_246|She died in middle age.
p227/p227_125|You've got to be vigilant.
p227/p227_332|I would do away with the dress code.
p227/p227_145|These men are a part of India.
p227/p227_289|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p227/p227_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p227/p227_042|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p227/p227_222|They have known the hard times.
p227/p227_313|It could well be military.
p227/p227_154|The strong pound also took its toll.
p227/p227_102|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p227/p227_149|That was the difference between the sides.
p227/p227_301|It's hard to see it.
p227/p227_236|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p227/p227_394|I wanted to go out on a high.
p227/p227_214|I think, therefore I am?
p227/p227_290|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p227/p227_170|What do we want to do that for?
p227/p227_351|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p227/p227_295|It was never a free kick.
p227/p227_177|The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
p227/p227_386|I do not like to lose.
p227/p227_279|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p227/p227_338|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p227/p227_142|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p227/p227_184|Well, you can have a tree.
p227/p227_195|I'm interested in interesting work.
p227/p227_090|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p227/p227_215|Who was she?
p227/p227_398|I can hardly believe it.
p227/p227_297|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p227/p227_370|We need to be prepared.
p227/p227_294|But the plot is not the point.
p227/p227_073|It is a terrible place.
p227/p227_143|So I got a blood test.
p227/p227_031|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p227/p227_399|How do you take them away?
p227/p227_146|Like the others, he was arrested.
p227/p227_199|He made no order on costs.
p227/p227_044|If I was a woman.
p227/p227_335|Are they free?
p227/p227_065|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p227/p227_166|What happened in that game?
p227/p227_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p227/p227_171|The people are the hero.
p227/p227_211|Does the name matter?
p227/p227_257|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p227/p227_194|Trading conditions have not been that bad.
p227/p227_235|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p227/p227_309|We have the easy part.
p227/p227_357|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p227/p227_148|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p227/p227_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p227/p227_265|And they were being paid?
p227/p227_366|Is it worth it?
p227/p227_271|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p227/p227_043|I'd come back from London.
p227/p227_314|And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
p227/p227_193|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p227/p227_192|They were seriously after him.
p227/p227_350|This is a trend which will be encouraged.
p227/p227_168|Was it the wife?
p227/p227_305|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p227/p227_107|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p227/p227_282|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p227/p227_091|That is the important thing.
p227/p227_374|It has been made to entertain.
p227/p227_378|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p227/p227_274|The capital costs are modest.
p227/p227_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p227/p227_095|You are like an animal.
p227/p227_041|He looks like an Afghan.
p227/p227_342|Have a look at this lot.
p227/p227_067|I have proved that in the past.
p227/p227_051|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p227/p227_255|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p227/p227_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p227/p227_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p227/p227_308|He will address the nation this evening.
p227/p227_103|It was never a starter.
p227/p227_027|I feel I did not have enough time.
p227/p227_239|There is a world of difference.
p227/p227_133|They could use a boost.
p227/p227_105|Such actions are rarely popular.
p227/p227_359|I am very interested in the subject.
p227/p227_165|We've made a couple of albums.
p227/p227_266|Was everything done to save people?
p227/p227_306|It is an amazing response.
p227/p227_081|By then, he was walking on water.
p227/p227_379|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p227/p227_050|That is very hard, alone.
p227/p227_262|Our decision making was poor.
p227/p227_258|Nato was not a love affair.
p227/p227_400|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p227/p227_136|This is a limited market.
p227/p227_273|No production contract is yet in sight.
p227/p227_109|You can spend money on housing.
p227/p227_062|They have to come up with a solution.
p227/p227_118|My life has changed a lot.
p227/p227_367|Does it matter?
p227/p227_355|The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
p227/p227_277|I can't get a job.
p227/p227_285|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p227/p227_284|There's not much money in cycling.
p227/p227_049|I expect a rapid response.
p227/p227_241|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p227/p227_365|What do they want us to do?
p227/p227_208|However, it is not as simple as this.
p227/p227_369|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p227/p227_101|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p227/p227_248|You will have seen the adverts.
p227/p227_299|She failed in her action.
p227/p227_196|It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
p227/p227_298|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p227/p227_291|It was an easy decision to come here.
p227/p227_293|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p227/p227_183|I have spoken to head office.
p227/p227_383|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p227/p227_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p227/p227_324|McNaughton was not so sure.
p227/p227_331|I'm not worried about the critics.
p227/p227_061|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p227/p227_175|The jury is still out.
p227/p227_113|However, we have to be cautious.
p227/p227_300|Stephen will get his first cap.
p227/p227_180|That will apply to both sets of fans.
p227/p227_231|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p227/p227_315|His job was not advertised.
p227/p227_169|Why change it?
p227/p227_276|I told you I was ill.
p227/p227_373|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p227/p227_304|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p227/p227_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p227/p227_110|That admission is not surprising.
p227/p227_155|It was a funny feeling.
p227/p227_114|But we could only help a handful of people.
p227/p227_079|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p227/p227_038|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p227/p227_080|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p227/p227_157|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p227/p227_311|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p227/p227_356|They were the acts of men.
p227/p227_303|We have to be very, very careful.
p227/p227_135|We could easily have lost that game.
p227/p227_032|There, you were just a body.
p227/p227_272|I should think so, too.
p227/p227_188|We've just had it confirmed.
p227/p227_069|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p227/p227_179|It makes no influence on the public.
p227/p227_137|Our position is quite simple.
p227/p227_233|The fight is under way.
p227/p227_360|He is not very big, either.
p227/p227_160|Seven people were later detained by police.
p227/p227_402|Persuaded to change his mind.
p227/p227_207|That might mean another delay.
p227/p227_229|It's just a normal life.
p227/p227_111|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p227/p227_209|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p227/p227_037|This represents a tough game for us.
p227/p227_243|My wife and family are the support system.
p227/p227_100|I had a fortunate war.
p227/p227_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p227/p227_352|There was no time scale.
p227/p227_186|They bought the property four years ago.
p227/p227_320|In that case, the children were not missing.
p227/p227_348|In the old days, it was easy.
p227/p227_039|Among them are many criminals.
p227/p227_104|And the match was not too bad, either.
p227/p227_071|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p227/p227_089|You might not make it.
p227/p227_218|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p227/p227_132|I felt he was excellent.
p227/p227_047|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p227/p227_216|You have caught a serial killer.
p227/p227_340|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p227/p227_088|We will deal with the refugees.
p227/p227_312|They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
p227/p227_040|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p227/p227_068|He had been a singer.
p227/p227_124|And does it?
p227/p227_223|That might help a bit.
p227/p227_112|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p227/p227_127|Any success would have been an improvement.
p227/p227_203|It was served by sheriff officers.
p227/p227_108|It is much as it has been described.
p227/p227_227|My daughter is an adult.
p227/p227_387|I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
p227/p227_181|I think it's a good sign.
p227/p227_253|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p227/p227_244|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p227/p227_028|We will look into it.
p227/p227_213|What are you not good at?
p227/p227_347|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p227/p227_339|So what happens next?
p227/p227_385|The salary changes are long overdue.
p227/p227_393|You have to rely on each other.
p227/p227_033|It is not for any other purpose.
p227/p227_252|The irony was not lost.
p227/p227_063|We will pay their bills.
p227/p227_296|My body is a wreck.
p227/p227_053|Four other charges were dropped.
p227/p227_242|I can't wait to meet him.
p227/p227_323|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p227/p227_116|It is just a tax on employment.
p227/p227_228|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p227/p227_251|They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
p227/p227_321|I have got a victim.
p227/p227_283|Every one is a winner.
p227/p227_119|We did what we had to do.
p227/p227_217|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p227/p227_046|There was no safety net.
p227/p227_396|It is a terrible equation.
p227/p227_074|Even the one she loved.
p227/p227_250|Moreover, it must be for all sports.
p227/p227_198|If the director is with you.
p227/p227_058|Do I have a favourite?
p227/p227_172|One season, they might do well.
p227/p227_201|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p227/p227_083|They lived for their children.
p227/p227_057|So is that it, then?
p227/p227_087|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p227/p227_392|That's not like us at all.
p227/p227_230|He must get to know himself.
p227/p227_263|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p227/p227_287|They can leave at any time.
p227/p227_334|What form did that take?
p227/p227_358|Of course, we want to go home.
p227/p227_401|After the match, do you?
p227/p227_260|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p227/p227_238|William Hague delighted his party.
p227/p227_288|You get a lot for your money.
p227/p227_001|Please call Stella.
p227/p227_302|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p227/p227_286|Not many companies can say that these days.
p227/p227_034|President Bush is at war.
p227/p227_139|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p227/p227_336|What are they for?
p227/p227_141|He's not a Celtic man.
p227/p227_147|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p227/p227_025|Meetings will also remain private.
p227/p227_085|The latter is due to be finished in February.
p227/p227_364|Had this been common practice?
p227/p227_084|Potions said he would drive.
p227/p227_075|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p227/p227_098|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p227/p227_354|Whether this return was too soon.
p227/p227_072|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p227/p227_060|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p227/p227_363|We are encouraged by the news.
p227/p227_200|I guess I was lucky, though.
p227/p227_070|Then followed a bout of flu.
p227/p227_030|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p227/p227_106|It is safe in our hands.
p227/p227_056|How are you, sir?
p227/p227_310|We are not increasing the number.
p227/p227_197|The force is with them.
p227/p227_330|There's still a bit to go.
p227/p227_341|I am not obsessed with sex.
p227/p227_035|I became a widow overnight.
p227/p227_164|There is no signature on this document.
p227/p227_176|But he has a lifeline.
p227/p227_052|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p227/p227_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
p227/p227_082|We have to offer value for money.
p227/p227_093|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p227/p227_055|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p227/p227_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p227/p227_316|This is a big step up.
p227/p227_190|This is the time to use it.
p227/p227_267|What was the matter for concern?
p227/p227_066|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p227/p227_327|It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
p227/p227_280|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p227/p227_384|He is in the queue.
p227/p227_329|He would help me with the form.
p227/p227_036|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p227/p227_120|Why do it otherwise?
p227/p227_317|It goes back a long way.
p227/p227_390|Celtic were pleased to help.
p227/p227_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p227/p227_382|This will impact on us.
p227/p227_319|We have a clean bill of health.
p227/p227_388|There is no deal as yet.
p227/p227_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p227/p227_126|We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
p227/p227_270|Did he trip?
p227/p227_333|It is so easy to be negative.
p227/p227_353|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p227/p227_307|Size is not the issue.
p227/p227_397|They have not got anyone.
p227/p227_163|Nobody did in those days.
p227/p227_131|However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
p227/p227_174|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p227/p227_153|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p227/p227_256|She took them for a term.
p227/p227_129|And I have some advice for my old friend.
p227/p227_275|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p227/p227_269|Is it in the right place?
p227/p227_237|We can certainly build on this.
p227/p227_318|The weather forecast isn't good.
p227/p227_064|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p227/p227_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p227/p227_247|It is set in Paris.
p227/p227_128|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p227/p227_212|how do you get it back?
p227/p227_189|A copy of the report will be sent to them.
p227/p227_178|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p227/p227_099|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p227/p227_077|I first met him last summer.
p227/p227_322|The judge was really nice.
p227/p227_375|It is a stroke of genius.
p227/p227_219|They make a selective perception process.
p227/p227_261|You can feel at home in China.
p227/p227_059|What do we do?
p227/p227_345|The king is delighted by the honour.
p227/p227_264|The baby deserves the credit.
p227/p227_096|No, the equipment is extra.
p227/p227_121|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p227/p227_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p227/p227_278|That could be in place by next year.
p227/p227_054|I could not do it.
p227/p227_349|I came into this world with nothing.
p227/p227_344|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p227/p227_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p227/p227_371|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p227/p227_144|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p227/p227_187|He is believed to live in Britain.
p227/p227_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p227/p227_086|This is a complex and detailed report.
p227/p227_343|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p227/p227_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p227/p227_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p227/p227_026|Movement has to take place.
p227/p227_245|It is the voice of the survivors.
p227/p227_140|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
p227/p227_240|We played them off the pitch.
p227/p227_123|So what is the campaign about?
p227/p227_134|It is a vicious circle.
p227/p227_159|He was in great spirits.
p227/p227_205|They have the cash and the fire power.
p227/p227_151|I was shaking on the blocks.
p227/p227_122|So, did she meet him?
p227/p227_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p227/p227_156|I'd love to be like Peter.
p227/p227_045|He was a home referee.
p227/p227_376|Italy was just behind the US.
p227/p227_232|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p227/p227_259|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p227/p227_337|Is there a waiting list?
p227/p227_167|Are you going to win?
p227/p227_204|This will be our new beginning.
p227/p227_191|You know the sort of thing.
p227/p227_281|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p227/p227_173|They made such decisions in London.
p227/p227_162|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p227/p227_268|Do I think about them often?
p227/p227_380|We are still getting over it.
p227/p227_326|The dealer is on notice.
p227/p227_117|This should begin in October.
p227/p227_138|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p227/p227_158|It is difficult to say.
p227/p227_377|It was forced to divert.
p227/p227_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p227/p227_372|His views are hardly surprising.
p227/p227_292|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p227/p227_076|There may be reasons for it.
p227/p227_206|My heart is with the artist.
p227/p227_150|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p227/p227_078|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p227/p227_328|The party lasted all night.
p227/p227_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p227/p227_368|A crucial moment has arrived.
p227/p227_391|They will fight for everything.
p227/p227_249|It is possible to be too good.
p227/p227_254|It is a court case.
p227/p227_161|They want to see him.
p227/p227_130|He is a great addition to our team.
p227/p227_220|There is no quick fix.
p227/p227_361|A report is expected next month.
p227/p227_389|In due course the deal was done.
p227/p227_097|The following are the principal provisions.
p227/p227_092|For once, you should believe the hype.
p227/p227_395|I felt the head was very like me.
p227/p227_210|This is a holy place.
p227/p227_048|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p227/p227_226|I'm just a regular person.
p295/p295_236|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p295/p295_044|It is just like any other club.
p295/p295_355|He is very much in our thoughts.
p295/p295_125|The look on his face was something special.
p295/p295_095|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p295/p295_375|There is no point in looking any further.
p295/p295_101|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p295/p295_275|My view has now completely changed.
p295/p295_042|A final agreement has not yet been completed.
p295/p295_298|Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
p295/p295_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p295/p295_056|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p295/p295_170|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p295/p295_110|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p295/p295_082|Or is it the European approach?
p295/p295_383|Our proposals are fully costed.
p295/p295_176|It's all about money, money, money.
p295/p295_192|They tried to give her advice.
p295/p295_354|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p295/p295_303|They know their son was murdered.
p295/p295_097|The mood was euphoric.
p295/p295_083|I had found my vision.
p295/p295_030|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p295/p295_317|It's a member of your family.
p295/p295_123|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p295/p295_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p295/p295_356|So what could be better than becoming captain?
p295/p295_347|Four years is a long time.
p295/p295_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p295/p295_280|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p295/p295_258|This is your country.
p295/p295_395|It was a fiery game.
p295/p295_296|We're not really commenting on that.
p295/p295_159|I feel alive and good today.
p295/p295_291|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p295/p295_268|This latter point is hugely important.
p295/p295_407|Boy is the town a mess.
p295/p295_319|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p295/p295_116|I have no plans to retire.
p295/p295_077|He said, My own position is quite simple.
p295/p295_419|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
p295/p295_035|After that, it's a step into the unknown.
p295/p295_255|When we started the album.
p295/p295_041|I'm sure he would love it.
p295/p295_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p295/p295_129|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p295/p295_221|This is the best moment of my career.
p295/p295_121|This is a test of our character.
p295/p295_174|The driver was unhurt.
p295/p295_360|But that is entirely a matter for them.
p295/p295_178|It was far from business as usual.
p295/p295_155|I'm sure they will be very happy.
p295/p295_269|The airport was even different.
p295/p295_385|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p295/p295_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p295/p295_277|I've never regretted my decision.
p295/p295_420|But, of course, it isn't.
p295/p295_112|It is reform in return for resources.
p295/p295_208|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p295/p295_067|And he listens to his artists as well.
p295/p295_279|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p295/p295_172|You're not going to forget something like that.
p295/p295_197|If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
p295/p295_414|How do we get more people in?
p295/p295_391|Our position is not a logic of war.
p295/p295_306|We're all going to take a holiday.
p295/p295_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p295/p295_264|What was the cause of all this outrage?
p295/p295_229|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p295/p295_120|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p295/p295_079|It has to find out what went wrong.
p295/p295_086|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p295/p295_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p295/p295_053|For sure we want to win it.
p295/p295_096|We recognise it as a key area.
p295/p295_415|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p295/p295_316|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p295/p295_217|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p295/p295_068|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p295/p295_384|We all started running forward.
p295/p295_189|That's how he did the damage.
p295/p295_109|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p295/p295_372|He had been surprised by the local reaction.
p295/p295_365|Our traditions and culture remain the same.
p295/p295_157|We must get the three points.
p295/p295_065|Can you imagine a world without design?
p295/p295_171|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p295/p295_063|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p295/p295_163|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p295/p295_326|It was hugely popular decision.
p295/p295_122|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p295/p295_389|The team is in division one in Spain.
p295/p295_164|The voters are our masters.
p295/p295_292|Anyone can still win this tournament.
p295/p295_263|It was seriously unpleasant.
p295/p295_349|No one wants to go through these things.
p295/p295_381|I could go on, but none of these things is true.
p295/p295_390|We don't even know his name.
p295/p295_312|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p295/p295_308|This is your chance.
p295/p295_202|I will be having talks with the workforce.
p295/p295_348|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p295/p295_200|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p295/p295_190|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p295/p295_387|It worked well in Monaco.
p295/p295_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p295/p295_345|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p295/p295_304|I love this tournament.
p295/p295_098|The time of judgment has arrived.
p295/p295_368|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p295/p295_245|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p295/p295_124|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p295/p295_104|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p295/p295_218|She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
p295/p295_106|This has been a terrible experience.
p295/p295_058|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p295/p295_271|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p295/p295_132|I can't see myself in one of those.
p295/p295_392|I have played really well all year.
p295/p295_290|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p295/p295_204|That's why he is a national treasure.
p295/p295_165|This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
p295/p295_062|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p295/p295_378|General, You didn't get a modified.
p295/p295_216|I don't know how they make the weight.
p295/p295_179|There's nothing new in that argument.
p295/p295_196|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p295/p295_149|I can't say that this is very usual.
p295/p295_160|We're in England for the time being.
p295/p295_087|I don't entirely buy that.
p295/p295_364|But no decision has been made.
p295/p295_043|It's just not our biggest problem.
p295/p295_048|We are going to New Broomfield to win.
p295/p295_403|We wanted to run away with her.
p295/p295_162|David Trimble has sold out.
p295/p295_080|People are already enjoying it.
p295/p295_369|There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
p295/p295_167|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p295/p295_141|I got very, very tired.
p295/p295_099|Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
p295/p295_243|When he came to see me on Monday.
p295/p295_257|Controllers major concern is safety.
p295/p295_131|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p295/p295_260|But it was the sensible thing to do.
p295/p295_186|I'm sure it will go on.
p295/p295_337|We are well insured.
p295/p295_177|A bit of match fitness is required.
p295/p295_259|That's the most important thing for me.
p295/p295_113|It offers a different viewpoint.
p295/p295_315|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p295/p295_309|They told him to go to drama school.
p295/p295_371|She makes me feel very proud.
p295/p295_135|He added, We have the same desire.
p295/p295_191|I need a publishing deal!
p295/p295_320|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p295/p295_184|No means testing will be required.
p295/p295_103|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p295/p295_107|He had a different agenda entirely.
p295/p295_201|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p295/p295_092|As a nation, we must become more active.
p295/p295_358|He was elected as a councillor last year.
p295/p295_212|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p295/p295_310|In order to get there, we have got to invest.
p295/p295_233|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p295/p295_234|His father and mother are in film production.
p295/p295_227|We don't have any senior players.
p295/p295_161|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p295/p295_237|We have seen the failure of politics.
p295/p295_346|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p295/p295_153|I try to be open to experience.
p295/p295_130|Five years later, the deception continued.
p295/p295_111|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p295/p295_055|Such debate is pointless.
p295/p295_194|Defeat is simply not an option.
p295/p295_195|We have all been there at some point.
p295/p295_144|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p295/p295_250|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p295/p295_238|The party will make up its own mind.
p295/p295_398|It was very lucky no-one was killed.
p295/p295_091|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p295/p295_302|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p295/p295_093|Nothing has changed from the season before.
p295/p295_424|There is still the question of his health.
p295/p295_046|I'm sure he didn't mean it.
p295/p295_205|It seems a waste of talents.
p295/p295_253|In my experience, he does not do that.
p295/p295_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p295/p295_261|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p295/p295_336|This time, however, may have been different.
p295/p295_409|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p295/p295_039|I think he was nervous to begin with.
p295/p295_335|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p295/p295_338|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p295/p295_146|The jury is still out.
p295/p295_078|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p295/p295_059|I knew there was a challenge for me.
p295/p295_333|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p295/p295_231|He has a wealth of experience.
p295/p295_396|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p295/p295_185|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p295/p295_085|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p295/p295_127|Sure, we have problems.
p295/p295_128|We will provide immediate access.
p295/p295_283|We still have a long, long way to go.
p295/p295_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p295/p295_054|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p295/p295_329|These findings are vitally important.
p295/p295_404|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p295/p295_209|We need to know more about her.
p295/p295_311|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p295/p295_045|Everything is possible in football.
p295/p295_262|The committees are due to report next year.
p295/p295_140|Seven people were later detained by police.
p295/p295_330|That's always the case, isn't it?
p295/p295_139|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p295/p295_108|Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
p295/p295_402|Blair also had a penalty.
p295/p295_411|After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
p295/p295_379|Surely the answer is yes.
p295/p295_400|He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
p295/p295_180|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p295/p295_353|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p295/p295_321|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p295/p295_151|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p295/p295_057|We recorded it at our own expense.
p295/p295_295|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p295/p295_173|They are in the euro.
p295/p295_230|This will help our confidence.
p295/p295_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p295/p295_069|SO now we know the secret.
p295/p295_154|I remember it clearly.
p295/p295_126|You have a very persuasive president.
p295/p295_214|What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
p295/p295_031|Which is where the manager comes in.
p295/p295_266|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p295/p295_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p295/p295_033|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p295/p295_088|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p295/p295_327|The decision was left entirely to him.
p295/p295_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p295/p295_288|WE live in a world of large numbers.
p295/p295_374|I am a committed European.
p295/p295_148|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p295/p295_352|Worse still, it can be infectious.
p295/p295_239|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p295/p295_145|He's working hard on that right now.
p295/p295_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p295/p295_222|My life has been turned upside down.
p295/p295_158|There has been a fair bit in between, too.
p295/p295_199|My intentions are to go on like this.
p295/p295_118|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p295/p295_305|Nobody will be forced to work.
p295/p295_344|But you can go beyond that condition.
p295/p295_300|It should be a condition of employment.
p295/p295_412|That can happen so easily.
p295/p295_034|We thought we would never see them again.
p295/p295_410|To me, it was just a miracle.
p295/p295_166|He is willing to pay the required amount.
p295/p295_267|However, the groups denied the claims.
p295/p295_183|The deadline is real and absolute.
p295/p295_307|It is good for Europe.
p295/p295_228|Not so, it transpires.
p295/p295_294|You're going to die.
p295/p295_244|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p295/p295_089|It is giving out the wrong message.
p295/p295_175|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p295/p295_328|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p295/p295_342|I believe in public services.
p295/p295_248|It became a book by itself.
p295/p295_133|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p295/p295_265|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p295/p295_314|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p295/p295_418|We suspect he was pleased.
p295/p295_072|I had no choice but to leave.
p295/p295_220|The joint bid is still on course.
p295/p295_193|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p295/p295_343|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p295/p295_331|I certainly think it should be there.
p295/p295_282|He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
p295/p295_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p295/p295_049|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p295/p295_134|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p295/p295_362|One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
p295/p295_297|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p295/p295_226|It left me with a sadness.
p295/p295_210|And what is she escaping from?
p295/p295_332|I'm sure that they will learn.
p295/p295_114|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p295/p295_413|This is a really serious issue.
p295/p295_339|However, that could alter following the latest case.
p295/p295_272|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p295/p295_350|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p295/p295_247|Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
p295/p295_252|What kind of festival is proposed?
p295/p295_143|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p295/p295_278|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p295/p295_187|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p295/p295_388|Things were not easy from the outset.
p295/p295_105|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p295/p295_090|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p295/p295_361|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p295/p295_301|It was not being marketed properly.
p295/p295_156|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p295/p295_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p295/p295_240|I am very sorry to hear about this.
p295/p295_038|That means an extra two years.
p295/p295_211|Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
p295/p295_037|He must not be removed from office.
p295/p295_074|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p295/p295_322|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p295/p295_373|The voices told me to do it.
p295/p295_142|What did you learn in school today?
p295/p295_138|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p295/p295_363|You're not going to get hurt.
p295/p295_064|It is, after all, a very funny play.
p295/p295_382|That sort of thing is long gone.
p295/p295_416|There is too much at stake for that.
p295/p295_224|Why is he not fighting for the Union?
p295/p295_249|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p295/p295_070|He's right up to a point.
p295/p295_061|I just have no maternal instincts.
p295/p295_273|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p295/p295_100|You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
p295/p295_076|But then they scored their fourth.
p295/p295_168|He should emerge as the winner.
p295/p295_181|The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
p295/p295_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p295/p295_028|Because we do not need it.
p295/p295_241|I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
p295/p295_401|That is not a position they enjoy.
p295/p295_115|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p295/p295_027|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p295/p295_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p295/p295_318|It's an hour of the same response.
p295/p295_060|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p295/p295_270|Whether this return was too soon.
p295/p295_289|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p295/p295_117|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p295/p295_066|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p295/p295_026|She was on the edge of breaking point.
p295/p295_286|I'm not sure.
p295/p295_386|That, however, is only part of the story.
p295/p295_376|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p295/p295_423|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p295/p295_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p295/p295_406|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p295/p295_284|He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
p295/p295_380|It's part of your life.
p295/p295_399|What has caused the demise of singing?
p295/p295_040|Our children are the future of our society.
p295/p295_073|Where does he go from here?
p295/p295_366|I decided not to renew the contract.
p295/p295_182|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p295/p295_251|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p295/p295_393|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p295/p295_215|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p295/p295_357|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p295/p295_293|My husband was angry.
p295/p295_032|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p295/p295_377|I'm astonished by this decision.
p295/p295_340|It's like a garage.
p295/p295_071|We would have looked out for each other.
p295/p295_359|You are always aware of the injury potential.
p295/p295_421|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p295/p295_405|I am not retiring.
p295/p295_313|I think they are right to be impatient.
p295/p295_232|It is a very beautiful city.
p295/p295_408|Barry will be able to handle this.
p295/p295_324|It will not work in our favour.
p295/p295_394|It was visibly on fire.
p295/p295_084|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p295/p295_287|But the championship is not over yet.
p295/p295_242|Hopefully we can put in a performance.
p295/p295_246|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p295/p295_152|We are right at the heart of Europe.
p295/p295_119|There were far more pressing matters to consider.
p295/p295_203|It's like an extension of your body.
p295/p295_422|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p295/p295_137|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p295/p295_285|The Old Firm are going nowhere.
p295/p295_325|We're very close to making it in Europe.
p295/p295_256|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p295/p295_370|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p295/p295_169|That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
p295/p295_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p295/p295_213|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p295/p295_254|We're all involved in creating the work.
p295/p295_225|Parole is a decision for me.
p295/p295_025|It has never been worthwhile.
p295/p295_276|Manchester United are the classic example.
p295/p295_050|He declined to give further details.
p295/p295_397|That is European law.
p295/p295_036|She asked me for the appointment with me.
p295/p295_274|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p295/p295_075|This time, there were no such rewards.
p295/p295_102|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p295/p295_150|We opened up and everything was gone.
p295/p295_323|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p295/p295_367|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p295/p295_188|She is still very poorly.
p295/p295_299|Could they perhaps be related?
p295/p295_235|It's about attitudes to change.
p295/p295_341|The last few weeks have been really bad.
p295/p295_219|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p295/p295_351|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p295/p295_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p295/p295_207|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p295/p295_206|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p295/p295_081|We're just delighted to be back on top.
p295/p295_281|Surely it can't get any worse.
p295/p295_198|At least two women were among those arrested.
p295/p295_147|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p295/p295_029|It has been supremely successful.
p295/p295_094|I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
p295/p295_052|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p295/p295_051|I think it was entirely the right decision.
p310/p310_281|THE atmosphere was electric.
p310/p310_408|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p310/p310_295|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p310/p310_119|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p310/p310_287|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p310/p310_240|We can't get over it.
p310/p310_389|I never agreed with that.
p310/p310_365|Their mind was already made up.
p310/p310_374|There may be some evidence to this effect.
p310/p310_232|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p310/p310_326|Nelson does not disappoint.
p310/p310_138|What's the rush?
p310/p310_006|When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p310/p310_149|I felt under no pressure today.
p310/p310_406|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p310/p310_148|Each one has its own system.
p310/p310_216|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p310/p310_246|And thought we would get away with it.
p310/p310_371|Pray that is so.
p310/p310_101|Construction is due to begin in February.
p310/p310_205|They will want to watch a winning team.
p310/p310_099|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p310/p310_245|They are not an item.
p310/p310_133|We don't see it as downgrading.
p310/p310_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p310/p310_069|In fact, they will not be disciplined.
p310/p310_335|There was barely a handful of chances.
p310/p310_303|And there is no cause for it.
p310/p310_304|That would have been too easy.
p310/p310_298|We had no part in it.
p310/p310_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p310/p310_081|But it took a lot of bottle.
p310/p310_325|There is no threat to them.
p310/p310_373|There was support from across the board.
p310/p310_264|We have not given up hope.
p310/p310_040|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p310/p310_301|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p310/p310_255|We went on to become very successful.
p310/p310_327|The goal will stay with me forever.
p310/p310_249|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p310/p310_175|However, you have just got to adjust it.
p310/p310_145|Is that too much to ask?
p310/p310_054|They were not defeated.
p310/p310_256|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p310/p310_032|I can't believe something like this could happen.
p310/p310_214|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p310/p310_370|Alex is a big part of that future.
p310/p310_170|Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
p310/p310_105|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p310/p310_239|It's a difficult job.
p310/p310_116|I'm confident we can turn things around.
p310/p310_353|That is of no use.
p310/p310_113|But there is another side.
p310/p310_398|My father died in childbirth.
p310/p310_104|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p310/p310_333|The South African defended his work ethic.
p310/p310_066|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p310/p310_074|Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
p310/p310_093|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p310/p310_269|I think it is totally wrong.
p310/p310_356|But he is frustrated at every turn.
p310/p310_065|I have had no social life at all.
p310/p310_410|This will help our confidence.
p310/p310_265|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p310/p310_252|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p310/p310_357|He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
p310/p310_130|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p310/p310_189|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p310/p310_072|Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
p310/p310_137|People can describe a moment in their life.
p310/p310_163|I was over the moon.
p310/p310_078|Are you watching Liverpool?
p310/p310_367|But it's got to be worth it.
p310/p310_392|We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
p310/p310_178|We have the location, which is assured.
p310/p310_254|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p310/p310_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p310/p310_218|He was jailed for five years.
p310/p310_046|And who would argue with that?
p310/p310_383|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p310/p310_179|The club are feeling no different today.
p310/p310_278|Well, when did he ever refuse?
p310/p310_258|We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
p310/p310_124|Five in a month isn't good enough.
p310/p310_329|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p310/p310_339|You need a reason for staying.
p310/p310_055|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p310/p310_048|We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
p310/p310_215|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p310/p310_187|This guy is never going to give up.
p310/p310_334|We have a team to reach the final.
p310/p310_380|I joined a group.
p310/p310_169|I guess it is down to focus.
p310/p310_033|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p310/p310_188|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p310/p310_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p310/p310_274|It seems to have worked.
p310/p310_067|Once again, he refused.
p310/p310_053|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p310/p310_181|I see the extended family once a year.
p310/p310_289|He must have something up his sleeve.
p310/p310_293|This is not a Scottish problem.
p310/p310_267|It's such a trial!
p310/p310_203|But first it goes out on TV.
p310/p310_413|People ask about the concept of a team.
p310/p310_317|Clearly, this was the important nursing.
p310/p310_220|We will not break even.
p310/p310_284|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p310/p310_037|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p310/p310_045|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p310/p310_177|He was pronounced dead in hospital.
p310/p310_291|We make good weapons.
p310/p310_095|I feel very strongly about that.
p310/p310_039|But one shouldn't go by that.
p310/p310_416|They've been here before.
p310/p310_417|I want a free vote.
p310/p310_272|The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
p310/p310_275|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p310/p310_041|Buying our way out is not an option.
p310/p310_161|Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
p310/p310_139|The starting point is pretty unusual.
p310/p310_118|It may be argued.
p310/p310_407|It brings together two essential elements.
p310/p310_057|All of us know it exists.
p310/p310_297|We are being hijacked.
p310/p310_309|It is just like the stock market.
p310/p310_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p310/p310_071|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p310/p310_128|They don't have to, but they normally do.
p310/p310_349|He showed he has some things to learn.
p310/p310_391|Have you heard anything from Paramount?
p310/p310_404|We were close, but not close enough.
p310/p310_063|It is the end of an era.
p310/p310_314|Boarding school was equally protective.
p310/p310_199|Or so we have long assumed.
p310/p310_369|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p310/p310_237|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p310/p310_381|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p310/p310_132|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p310/p310_162|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p310/p310_168|And then came the seventies.
p310/p310_283|We're going to change our party.
p310/p310_151|And that was the adults.
p310/p310_096|Now he will have to start again.
p310/p310_279|Today's ruling confirms that.
p310/p310_209|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p310/p310_310|The damage from the fire was huge.
p310/p310_210|One must hope not!
p310/p310_414|Who has he fought?
p310/p310_076|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p310/p310_083|I wish they, too, would get a grip.
p310/p310_273|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p310/p310_042|There are big names.
p310/p310_159|It's never the same problem.
p310/p310_191|This is the first job of the director - leadership.
p310/p310_233|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p310/p310_343|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p310/p310_368|But does the same thing happen with music?
p310/p310_140|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p310/p310_001|Please call Stella.
p310/p310_068|This is about the Orange Order.
p310/p310_123|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p310/p310_393|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p310/p310_424|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p310/p310_386|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p310/p310_058|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p310/p310_173|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p310/p310_167|Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
p310/p310_073|The Commons is too outdated.
p310/p310_036|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p310/p310_318|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p310/p310_049|They had four children together.
p310/p310_362|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p310/p310_229|I get to work with very good people.
p310/p310_276|There was a battle there.
p310/p310_242|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p310/p310_202|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p310/p310_135|No date has been set for the appeal.
p310/p310_085|This avalanche is just beginning.
p310/p310_192|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p310/p310_280|It's good news and long overdue.
p310/p310_223|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p310/p310_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p310/p310_270|And a film maker was born.
p310/p310_077|Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
p310/p310_060|She has a wonderful mind.
p310/p310_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p310/p310_079|He would be with his peers.
p310/p310_388|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p310/p310_409|We had a reunion last week.
p310/p310_360|Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
p310/p310_208|This will be just another tax on motorists.
p310/p310_180|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p310/p310_106|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p310/p310_421|So he should be.
p310/p310_059|This is the band.
p310/p310_114|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p310/p310_311|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p310/p310_150|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p310/p310_126|This is just one example.
p310/p310_213|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p310/p310_091|He also called in at another farm.
p310/p310_305|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p310/p310_043|That argument has been won.
p310/p310_316|It will be the final push.
p310/p310_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p310/p310_288|A formal decision will be announced within months.
p310/p310_086|Journalists should make him.
p310/p310_330|It is a high time to act.
p310/p310_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p310/p310_185|There was even a joke.
p310/p310_194|I just had so much fun.
p310/p310_363|I love the moment of being first.
p310/p310_345|That is not the way we should operate.
p310/p310_164|And really, the songs are the key thing.
p310/p310_211|He is a Satan.
p310/p310_250|I would urge the Government to think again.
p310/p310_286|Is he any good in the kitchen?
p310/p310_313|What, then, is the real thing?
p310/p310_419|It would show them a positive way forward.
p310/p310_120|I bought a car at auction.
p310/p310_282|I'd never heard him in person before.
p310/p310_262|That's the day job.
p310/p310_087|I believe we have a good chance.
p310/p310_379|That is why it's so lyrical.
p310/p310_166|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p310/p310_034|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p310/p310_247|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p310/p310_315|Most people know that.
p310/p310_136|He is dying from cancer.
p310/p310_352|It is now time for justice.
p310/p310_160|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p310/p310_271|It was also put on the Internet.
p310/p310_236|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p310/p310_323|The result today is an impasse.
p310/p310_290|He was at home with his pals.
p310/p310_089|She may even appear in some more films.
p310/p310_403|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p310/p310_260|That is my role.
p310/p310_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p310/p310_219|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p310/p310_338|We don't know the scale of need.
p310/p310_144|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p310/p310_062|We're into that build-up now.
p310/p310_322|But we were wrong.
p310/p310_165|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p310/p310_321|But both were involved with other matters.
p310/p310_402|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p310/p310_243|This represents a tough game for us.
p310/p310_183|We couldn't go very fast.
p310/p310_061|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p310/p310_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p310/p310_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p310/p310_399|The issue has still to be resolved.
p310/p310_340|Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
p310/p310_359|Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
p310/p310_047|I hope you will leave it at that.
p310/p310_201|That was the personal impulse.
p310/p310_171|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p310/p310_221|We will look into it.
p310/p310_342|I don't expect to see that this time.
p310/p310_332|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p310/p310_241|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p310/p310_285|I have learned a lot from him.
p310/p310_094|I agree with them.
p310/p310_075|That was then and this is now.
p310/p310_125|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p310/p310_277|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p310/p310_146|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p310/p310_186|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p310/p310_266|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p310/p310_097|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p310/p310_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p310/p310_234|Look at the table.
p310/p310_127|Both offices were closed yesterday.
p310/p310_300|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p310/p310_228|Things are moving together.
p310/p310_103|In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
p310/p310_312|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p310/p310_142|It was an ambush.
p310/p310_200|They responded with victories.
p310/p310_197|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p310/p310_070|We're not the tourist board.
p310/p310_056|How can they engage with the work?
p310/p310_412|They also have good neighbours.
p310/p310_025|He was the youngest of the British team.
p310/p310_090|This is the best moment of my career.
p310/p310_344|The big issue for us is the review.
p310/p310_051|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p310/p310_026|I fell in love with the ballet.
p310/p310_107|Or, rather, it isn't.
p310/p310_157|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p310/p310_084|I am so sorry.
p310/p310_131|David was not either.
p310/p310_418|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p310/p310_395|I don't think it's vital.
p310/p310_341|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p310/p310_143|I think this proposal is excellent.
p310/p310_261|He also presented You Bet!
p310/p310_350|Or do they?
p310/p310_092|I don't know why she is not here.
p310/p310_331|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p310/p310_122|His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
p310/p310_294|Then followed a bout of flu.
p310/p310_102|We shall rely on human beings.
p310/p310_377|Such actions are rarely popular.
p310/p310_324|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p310/p310_390|I didn't actually believe them at first.
p310/p310_337|I have found my vision.
p310/p310_248|It's more like a Labour Party rally.
p310/p310_384|And they all had these other commitments.
p310/p310_257|No, is the answer to your first question.
p310/p310_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
p310/p310_156|And he had much need.
p310/p310_134|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p310/p310_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p310/p310_387|They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
p310/p310_230|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p310/p310_110|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p310/p310_222|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p310/p310_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p310/p310_154|I felt the head was very like me.
p310/p310_098|I don't know how it happened.
p310/p310_052|I fell to the ground.
p310/p310_385|However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
p310/p310_400|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p310/p310_364|It is a decision which has paid off.
p310/p310_347|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p310/p310_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p310/p310_050|Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p310/p310_302|Our young people are leaving.
p310/p310_394|There was only one hole in it.
p310/p310_207|Who is going to be penalised?
p310/p310_198|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p310/p310_238|Last year was not a good year.
p310/p310_397|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p310/p310_111|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p310/p310_141|They receive a high profile in the media.
p310/p310_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p310/p310_336|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p310/p310_088|However, it is no longer with the national team.
p310/p310_082|They don't work anymore anyway.
p310/p310_100|After that nothing could save him.
p310/p310_174|He put a lot of effort into it.
p310/p310_306|This is not a faceless system.
p310/p310_226|However, it very nearly went wrong.
p310/p310_196|I will wait until later.
p310/p310_292|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p310/p310_227|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p310/p310_296|That was the most annoying thing.
p310/p310_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
p310/p310_396|It might not survive the process.
p310/p310_109|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p310/p310_147|I've so much respect for him.
p310/p310_030|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p310/p310_158|This can only help us go forward.
p310/p310_263|It really is taken seriously.
p310/p310_172|His track record is not promising.
p310/p310_224|Some of his family still live there.
p310/p310_064|We shall not do that.
p310/p310_195|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p310/p310_411|We have high hopes that this will work.
p310/p310_152|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p310/p310_225|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p310/p310_108|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p310/p310_206|I think it's awful.
p310/p310_415|The film is about the cost of genius.
p310/p310_420|I think it's a disgrace.
p310/p310_422|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p310/p310_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p310/p310_320|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p310/p310_372|In fact it isn't related to either.
p310/p310_348|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p310/p310_129|We stopped at half-time.
p310/p310_307|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p310/p310_299|It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p310/p310_351|They are the innocent victims.
p310/p310_376|So what does one do?
p310/p310_253|I was happiest with my short game.
p310/p310_375|It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
p310/p310_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p310/p310_346|More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
p310/p310_035|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p310/p310_080|They seem to be backing off from that.
p310/p310_029|Did you see that?
p310/p310_112|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p310/p310_268|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p310/p310_115|There is no guarantee.
p310/p310_176|That was moving the goalposts.
p310/p310_251|It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p310/p310_355|Now it is measuring it in dollars.
p310/p310_031|And the winners are.
p310/p310_308|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p310/p310_038|We're still talking with a few people.
p310/p310_382|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p310/p310_354|I could have been offended.
p310/p310_117|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p310/p310_358|This is the lowest of the low.
p310/p310_423|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p310/p310_027|That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
p310/p310_193|It is too early to speculate.
p310/p310_378|The methadone programme is completely out of control.
p310/p310_028|It feels like a winner already.
p310/p310_217|There was no cohesion.
p310/p310_401|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p310/p310_155|We started with that.
p310/p310_153|This is a job for the Government.
p310/p310_361|He's a nice guy.
p310/p310_044|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p310/p310_235|This film will be totally awesome.
p310/p310_259|That could be at least five years away.
p310/p310_231|He must not be removed from office.
p310/p310_190|The show is small but perfectly formed.
p310/p310_366|I had some time with Aston Villa.
p310/p310_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p310/p310_204|What is the truth about the cow?
p310/p310_319|The campaign was raucous.
p310/p310_212|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p310/p310_121|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p310/p310_405|And that started me thinking.
p310/p310_328|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p310/p310_182|I'm not a magician.
p310/p310_244|He saw it all as a big game.
p326/p326_383|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p326/p326_046|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p326/p326_070|Messages have to be reinforced.
p326/p326_251|I tend not to look back.
p326/p326_233|You write a play.
p326/p326_124|Nor is he allowed out without permission.
p326/p326_204|Was this a new event?
p326/p326_188|I want to be there by right.
p326/p326_293|We have to adapt to this level.
p326/p326_159|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p326/p326_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p326/p326_326|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p326/p326_200|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p326/p326_378|But sometimes it works out all right.
p326/p326_044|What did they think of her voice?
p326/p326_306|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p326/p326_097|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p326/p326_227|I was very, very happy.
p326/p326_222|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p326/p326_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p326/p326_079|I am immensely proud of them.
p326/p326_149|Our position is clear.
p326/p326_181|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p326/p326_248|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p326/p326_361|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p326/p326_258|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p326/p326_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p326/p326_150|Yet it does not lose appeal.
p326/p326_299|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p326/p326_126|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p326/p326_347|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p326/p326_161|She wanted to move.
p326/p326_164|But it's a subtle process.
p326/p326_341|It would be a massive boost for them.
p326/p326_287|We have to focus on what is important.
p326/p326_039|There is nothing like this back home.
p326/p326_198|These people just lost their child.
p326/p326_316|It certainly sounded it at times.
p326/p326_360|There is no musical background in his family.
p326/p326_397|My future is in the marathon.
p326/p326_230|What is the point of jailing him?
p326/p326_195|The British government said she was coming home.
p326/p326_036|It was my shortest audition.
p326/p326_370|I'm desperate to play in this match.
p326/p326_220|He was then replaced by Ross.
p326/p326_346|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p326/p326_098|It was exactly four months away.
p326/p326_139|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p326/p326_190|You've just got to move on.
p326/p326_275|Was it just negligent.
p326/p326_257|We would expect it to disappear in time.
p326/p326_141|We are not going to forget.
p326/p326_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p326/p326_203|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p326/p326_328|We are the weakest link.
p326/p326_354|I have also been delighted with Stevie.
p326/p326_087|I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
p326/p326_241|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p326/p326_274|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p326/p326_042|We just love to chat.
p326/p326_206|In the old days, it was easy.
p326/p326_337|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p326/p326_217|He scored a touchdown.
p326/p326_101|It certainly gives you hope.
p326/p326_162|How do you find the youngsters?
p326/p326_216|You're going to take away my life.
p326/p326_304|It makes a huge difference.
p326/p326_356|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p326/p326_252|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p326/p326_111|Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
p326/p326_226|He is a law unto himself.
p326/p326_207|I came into this world with nothing.
p326/p326_125|He looked very sharp.
p326/p326_191|I feel really good.
p326/p326_380|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p326/p326_334|The mood was defiant.
p326/p326_157|I felt he was excellent.
p326/p326_127|I've beaten her a few times.
p326/p326_305|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p326/p326_192|So You Think You Want  to be Victoria?
p326/p326_029|We have got to attack.
p326/p326_030|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p326/p326_189|The fund has three elements.
p326/p326_290|Well, was it?
p326/p326_134|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p326/p326_086|I can't believe it.
p326/p326_376|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p326/p326_151|But what will we put on it?
p326/p326_102|If he does not leave, he will be shot.
p326/p326_034|At least two women were among those arrested.
p326/p326_228|No-one should see that.
p326/p326_100|It was set in a cafe.
p326/p326_179|He didn't have long to wait.
p326/p326_281|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p326/p326_201|It was worth a photograph.
p326/p326_116|What she will do next?
p326/p326_122|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p326/p326_137|People tended to stay there for some time.
p326/p326_068|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p326/p326_298|The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
p326/p326_096|We are very very proud of Alain.
p326/p326_345|I can't speak for him.
p326/p326_152|Then in came a succession of signings.
p326/p326_213|After that he became more romantic.
p326/p326_193|This is still a young team, you know.
p326/p326_301|English is the language of pop music.
p326/p326_242|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p326/p326_249|Too often it is not.
p326/p326_283|We will be homeless.
p326/p326_094|That'd be good for the whole city.
p326/p326_300|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p326/p326_342|You never had it so good.
p326/p326_108|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p326/p326_375|They did not threaten anyone.
p326/p326_119|She has now been registered as disabled.
p326/p326_286|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p326/p326_339|We gave them the goal.
p326/p326_309|They play together perfectly.
p326/p326_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p326/p326_398|Then he did it twice.
p326/p326_263|I ran to get out of the way.
p326/p326_320|He is involved in everything.
p326/p326_253|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p326/p326_272|Three bystanders were killed.
p326/p326_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p326/p326_318|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p326/p326_259|I'd love to have been on the pitch.
p326/p326_211|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p326/p326_246|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p326/p326_367|We're not travel agents.
p326/p326_092|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p326/p326_025|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p326/p326_120|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p326/p326_117|Hopefully, everything is for the best.
p326/p326_113|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p326/p326_273|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p326/p326_268|We're very pleased about the verdict.
p326/p326_027|She is an angel.
p326/p326_322|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p326/p326_278|Which is a shame.
p326/p326_202|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p326/p326_107|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p326/p326_395|It was like the old days.
p326/p326_254|My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
p326/p326_389|A century on, little has changed.
p326/p326_054|His voice is strong.
p326/p326_176|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p326/p326_154|A new school will be built.
p326/p326_315|We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
p326/p326_276|He made no big mistakes.
p326/p326_325|You see, my back has gone.
p326/p326_371|That's always the case, isn't it?
p326/p326_261|I didn't know what he was capable of.
p326/p326_208|We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
p326/p326_390|Wrong decisions Address in full
p326/p326_245|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p326/p326_064|It was a foolhardy decision.
p326/p326_133|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p326/p326_170|The threat to rural areas is real.
p326/p326_400|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p326/p326_145|For a moment it was all about her.
p326/p326_295|We won't let you down.
p326/p326_160|I think we believed the tie was won.
p326/p326_084|They were two different types.
p326/p326_284|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p326/p326_158|It's not just a male agenda.
p326/p326_209|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p326/p326_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p326/p326_056|But they add up.
p326/p326_136|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p326/p326_348|I can't see him reversing that.
p326/p326_032|There we were on the first tee.
p326/p326_118|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p326/p326_264|She's now on the back benches.
p326/p326_074|More patience and composure was required.
p326/p326_078|We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
p326/p326_340|Self control is just one instalment.
p326/p326_374|It is patently true.
p326/p326_060|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p326/p326_358|Labour is providing none of these.
p326/p326_088|We have them in offices all over.
p326/p326_130|It's about attitudes to change.
p326/p326_180|That was merely their initial problem.
p326/p326_055|They may yet have the last laugh.
p326/p326_082|No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
p326/p326_169|It was a great team effort.
p326/p326_256|My game just seems to keep on improving.
p326/p326_147|Once they go away they won't come back.
p326/p326_319|They treated me with respect and courtesy.
p326/p326_229|We are going to go about our lives.
p326/p326_183|I need them to set my career.
p326/p326_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p326/p326_175|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p326/p326_114|Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
p326/p326_379|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p326/p326_194|It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
p326/p326_069|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p326/p326_049|His art was not just about emotions.
p326/p326_052|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p326/p326_019|Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p326/p326_066|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p326/p326_297|There's a strong involvement.
p326/p326_234|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p326/p326_333|Many innocent people will die.
p326/p326_053|Labour was too busy to respond.
p326/p326_035|How would it work?
p326/p326_314|Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
p326/p326_312|The other conditions were not specified.
p326/p326_148|It's a difficult one to comment on.
p326/p326_350|I'm really looking forward to it.
p326/p326_140|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p326/p326_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p326/p326_214|It's not long enough.
p326/p326_073|The Insider opens tomorrow.
p326/p326_063|He will become the sovereign.
p326/p326_327|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p326/p326_185|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p326/p326_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p326/p326_138|Holland won by five wickets.
p326/p326_218|They finished second and third.
p326/p326_238|I'm happy with the outcome.
p326/p326_081|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p326/p326_033|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p326/p326_387|Art is still a risky investment.
p326/p326_110|It left me with a sadness.
p326/p326_105|I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
p326/p326_106|Our people should be immune.
p326/p326_244|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p326/p326_168|She is a very lucky young lady.
p326/p326_199|Everyone knew where they were.
p326/p326_123|That is a data management problem.
p326/p326_311|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p326/p326_291|That's my big challenge.
p326/p326_090|There has been a sense of frustration.
p326/p326_135|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p326/p326_104|We've all been there at some point.
p326/p326_338|It's our worst nightmare.
p326/p326_076|I was shocked and outraged.
p326/p326_153|It will benefit a lot of people.
p326/p326_343|Both are national treasures.
p326/p326_047|What on earth is wrong with you?
p326/p326_269|It will not be a long campaign.
p326/p326_240|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p326/p326_231|They made it very difficult for us.
p326/p326_093|This time, there were no such rewards.
p326/p326_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p326/p326_067|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p326/p326_196|It's not even finished.
p326/p326_091|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p326/p326_062|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p326/p326_280|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p326/p326_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p326/p326_071|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p326/p326_266|It may also be her last.
p326/p326_146|It changed my life.
p326/p326_385|I have to keep working hard.
p326/p326_369|Broke down and can't be fixed.
p326/p326_026|The message was clear.
p326/p326_386|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p326/p326_393|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p326/p326_271|Maybe it helps us.
p326/p326_388|That is difficult to answer.
p326/p326_313|They should use it on the catwalk.
p326/p326_103|Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
p326/p326_223|She did not attend the courtroom.
p326/p326_142|I'm the one that said it.
p326/p326_186|He was all blackened.
p326/p326_075|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p326/p326_279|That is where our future lies.
p326/p326_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p326/p326_155|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p326/p326_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p326/p326_331|He did, and he missed.
p326/p326_177|The Scottish management team will settle for that.
p326/p326_143|It's not hard to get involved.
p326/p326_040|The police believe the man was not injured.
p326/p326_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p326/p326_037|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p326/p326_355|He's on the wrong side.
p326/p326_237|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p326/p326_043|I read about it in the newspapers.
p326/p326_260|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p326/p326_041|It would be a miracle.
p326/p326_083|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p326/p326_085|Chelsea was a great club.
p326/p326_296|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p326/p326_394|However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
p326/p326_132|Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
p326/p326_357|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p326/p326_239|An aide was instructed to get a copy.
p326/p326_292|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p326/p326_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p326/p326_359|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p326/p326_396|A great deal has been achieved.
p326/p326_392|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p326/p326_172|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p326/p326_224|People can get them if they want.
p326/p326_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p326/p326_364|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p326/p326_072|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p326/p326_363|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p326/p326_057|You can feel at home in China.
p326/p326_382|You feel the pride.
p326/p326_330|She looked very, very poor.
p326/p326_077|It's just gotten too big.
p326/p326_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p326/p326_317|Anyone can take a photo.
p326/p326_255|I got a yellow card.
p326/p326_109|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p326/p326_277|It will not be today, though.
p326/p326_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p326/p326_302|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p326/p326_115|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p326/p326_197|That is a matter for Mr Graham.
p326/p326_178|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p326/p326_303|It is a simple equation.
p326/p326_184|I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
p326/p326_089|It need not be like that.
p326/p326_236|Seems a sensible compromise.
p326/p326_399|So is the rest of British sport.
p326/p326_167|About the bad things that happened to me.
p326/p326_166|There is no internal damage.
p326/p326_294|So what is it with Nato?
p326/p326_366|Finally action had been taken.
p326/p326_061|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p326/p326_171|Tourism continues to struggle.
p326/p326_059|This is all part of opening the door.
p326/p326_381|Therein lies the problem.
p326/p326_362|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p326/p326_156|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p326/p326_028|It is believed he had been stabbed.
p326/p326_031|United were in control without always being dominant.
p326/p326_165|We all have to look in the mirror.
p326/p326_262|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p326/p326_351|Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
p326/p326_321|Family, if you like.
p326/p326_099|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p326/p326_349|He was on a horse.
p326/p326_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p326/p326_243|It is just completely erased.
p326/p326_001|Please call Stella.
p326/p326_332|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p326/p326_221|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p326/p326_080|It was extremely cold.
p326/p326_335|We have now no choice.
p326/p326_288|They have to work so hard.
p326/p326_210|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p326/p326_344|The then secretary was not amused.
p326/p326_129|This is not a long-term commitment.
p326/p326_289|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p326/p326_391|My father had been unwell for many years.
p326/p326_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p326/p326_174|We are already under pressure.
p326/p326_372|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p326/p326_050|They are all bright and different.
p326/p326_310|We will meet again.
p326/p326_163|It's always a rehearsal.
p326/p326_329|It had been on the cards.
p326/p326_058|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p326/p326_128|His father and mother are in film production.
p326/p326_219|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p326/p326_247|Scotland were on Saturday.
p326/p326_182|It would be really interesting if they did.
p326/p326_131|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p326/p326_187|This is your country.
p326/p326_373|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p326/p326_285|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p326/p326_205|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p326/p326_045|They say they feel different.
p326/p326_212|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p326/p326_095|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p326/p326_215|My view has now completely changed.
p326/p326_324|I've only met him three times.
p326/p326_336|I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
p326/p326_065|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p326/p326_368|It's hard not to.
p326/p326_377|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p326/p326_308|Could you put it in writing?
p326/p326_265|But there are some problems.
p326/p326_112|The boys are very confident.
p326/p326_353|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p326/p326_144|I've grown up a bit.
p326/p326_250|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p326/p326_307|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p326/p326_352|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p326/p326_384|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p326/p326_267|It should not lose out in any way.
p326/p326_235|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p326/p326_282|That was enough for the committee.
p326/p326_270|Subs not used, McGraw.
p326/p326_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p326/p326_323|I don't want to change anything.
p326/p326_051|I found a fault and worked at it.
p326/p326_038|She didn't tell us anything new.
p326/p326_232|Well, there is a bed.
p326/p326_121|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p326/p326_225|Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
p326/p326_173|Its first awards will do just that.
p326/p326_048|We will continue to pressure the Government.
p311/p311_198|It is that sort of film.
p311/p311_039|He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
p311/p311_081|You just have to adjust.
p311/p311_204|I'm very frightened of the dark.
p311/p311_234|Where do we go from here?
p311/p311_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p311/p311_384|He didn't really, we just made that up.
p311/p311_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p311/p311_205|Our message was inclusive.
p311/p311_149|It's been such a waste of money.
p311/p311_233|I came here this week to work.
p311/p311_192|It is all credit to them today.
p311/p311_335|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p311/p311_104|But things are never the same again.
p311/p311_334|You have to feel for the guy.
p311/p311_167|They haven't been thought through.
p311/p311_078|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p311/p311_105|It is easy to agree with him.
p311/p311_181|That will help my case a bit.
p311/p311_187|Another man said, It was horrible.
p311/p311_371|This was a chilling echo.
p311/p311_100|It is quite a new prescription.
p311/p311_376|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p311/p311_089|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p311/p311_194|Nobody could survive on that.
p311/p311_047|That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
p311/p311_091|Some things in life you have to accept.
p311/p311_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p311/p311_276|They also intend to travel today.
p311/p311_350|Eriksson would have approved.
p311/p311_026|It's ahead of Labour.
p311/p311_357|They should have listened to me.
p311/p311_278|The casualties were not named.
p311/p311_330|If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
p311/p311_214|Openness is always the best way.
p311/p311_076|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p311/p311_363|We would have concerns about that.
p311/p311_034|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p311/p311_375|We don't ask for much.
p311/p311_423|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p311/p311_025|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p311/p311_332|The German had a point to make.
p311/p311_058|I just went a bit too far.
p311/p311_174|The highest rate is in Glasgow.
p311/p311_387|My players are precious to me.
p311/p311_148|This is in a league of its own.
p311/p311_385|Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
p311/p311_381|The replacements made a big difference.
p311/p311_188|But we still don't know.
p311/p311_413|We haven't been told.
p311/p311_139|They got the job done.
p311/p311_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p311/p311_231|They are just trying to cover up.
p311/p311_094|The party has never fully recovered.
p311/p311_383|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p311/p311_301|He said he was sorry.
p311/p311_344|They will now get that support.
p311/p311_311|This is new money.
p311/p311_210|This time, he will be more on the defensive.
p311/p311_037|They did a very good job.
p311/p311_316|This is not out of choice.
p311/p311_110|It is not really used by many people.
p311/p311_296|Then there's the Old Firm.
p311/p311_166|Two options are being proposed.
p311/p311_216|It can be halted.
p311/p311_029|It was a matter of chance.
p311/p311_092|I am relishing the challenge.
p311/p311_172|He was at home with his pals.
p311/p311_321|This was another video cassette.
p311/p311_080|We've got a job to do.
p311/p311_340|This Government is cutting taxes.
p311/p311_056|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p311/p311_138|We are still the best team in Britain.
p311/p311_320|We'll see what happens.
p311/p311_178|I was delighted with every one of them.
p311/p311_120|There were no new cases yesterday.
p311/p311_088|I have hardly any commitments.
p311/p311_362|I hope he would have been very pleased.
p311/p311_237|This was an option from the beginning.
p311/p311_299|They're not always the same person.
p311/p311_127|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p311/p311_406|I was frustrated here.
p311/p311_113|Don't get me wrong.
p311/p311_258|The family baton is handed on.
p311/p311_185|It feels that the game is off.
p311/p311_112|He has one son and one daughter.
p311/p311_359|It was like someone had died.
p311/p311_313|The decision was left entirely to him.
p311/p311_324|He pretended not to care.
p311/p311_409|I was furious about it.
p311/p311_156|It's like a high school play.
p311/p311_226|Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
p311/p311_070|It happens in many countries.
p311/p311_221|He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
p311/p311_043|I knew my contract was up this year.
p311/p311_265|They said we were out of touch.
p311/p311_331|That is why we are here.
p311/p311_338|Was it just negligent.
p311/p311_358|I am greatly encouraged.
p311/p311_260|We are still alive and kicking.
p311/p311_370|So he was anxious to try something new.
p311/p311_365|It's unusual to say the least.
p311/p311_228|I never made any offer to Mark.
p311/p311_269|The kids are paying the price.
p311/p311_312|We have not given up on the game.
p311/p311_199|She was not hard done by.
p311/p311_282|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p311/p311_364|Taxes may need to rise.
p311/p311_367|Our Great Depression is our lives.
p311/p311_262|There are many questions to be answered.
p311/p311_405|It was the same old story.
p311/p311_072|But the cost to his health was enormous.
p311/p311_222|The professor said the results were positive.
p311/p311_141|They have been contrasting years, certainly.
p311/p311_279|I was shaking on the blocks.
p311/p311_248|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p311/p311_346|It seemed so personal.
p311/p311_356|I hope they will understand the reasons.
p311/p311_271|They didn't find any substance.
p311/p311_082|Well, that's just a third district.
p311/p311_329|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p311/p311_134|I could do a better job.
p311/p311_046|My heart is with the artist.
p311/p311_403|The men are safe and unharmed.
p311/p311_244|However, that is a sizeable if.
p311/p311_400|In short, the club was broke.
p311/p311_157|He was part of South Africa.
p311/p311_170|Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
p311/p311_236|He gets his moment.
p311/p311_195|They seem to turn up for them.
p311/p311_342|This is a big club.
p311/p311_420|We will listen to colleagues.
p311/p311_393|She returned home a few days later.
p311/p311_196|They were kept there for a summer.
p311/p311_053|We will miss him very much.
p311/p311_399|It is the end of an era.
p311/p311_162|But no, it's not funny.
p311/p311_038|That's what we're still trying to do.
p311/p311_369|We have some concerns.
p311/p311_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p311/p311_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p311/p311_246|The English are coming.
p311/p311_422|It's something we want to make work.
p311/p311_349|I think we have got the balance right.
p311/p311_074|Already the children are dying.
p311/p311_224|But it's just great to have won.
p311/p311_308|The director's a genius.
p311/p311_115|Otherwise we will pay the price.
p311/p311_137|I get the bus.
p311/p311_372|They really want to do it.
p311/p311_062|It has been declared.
p311/p311_288|It has become very confused.
p311/p311_360|What does he want him to look like?
p311/p311_287|The defender made an impressive debut.
p311/p311_275|He will do very well.
p311/p311_171|I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p311/p311_326|I was in tears in the street.
p311/p311_352|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p311/p311_052|This is a holy place.
p311/p311_411|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p311/p311_300|It would have to be backdated.
p311/p311_270|He said he was delighted by the award.
p311/p311_290|I am not in denial.
p311/p311_328|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p311/p311_142|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p311/p311_068|I was the trial judge in both.
p311/p311_059|I am delighted for Simon.
p311/p311_377|I had a wonderful time working with him.
p311/p311_208|Everything in the symphony is there.
p311/p311_209|There has also been some Scots input.
p311/p311_408|Are you watching Liverpool?
p311/p311_096|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p311/p311_215|It wouldn't go off.
p311/p311_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p311/p311_189|Who do you think you are?
p311/p311_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p311/p311_254|That's my daughter acting.
p311/p311_173|This is a very interesting move.
p311/p311_179|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p311/p311_259|How can this be?
p311/p311_412|Of course we aren't.
p311/p311_310|It was the climax of the thing.
p311/p311_163|In that case, the children were not missing.
p311/p311_122|But once again it was not converted.
p311/p311_298|We were in different places, usually in cellars.
p311/p311_027|It is the whole package.
p311/p311_144|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p311/p311_343|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p311/p311_203|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p311/p311_040|We cannot go on in this fashion.
p311/p311_417|He also called in at another farm.
p311/p311_345|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p311/p311_051|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p311/p311_071|It's not just about the shows.
p311/p311_336|Bomber was not amused.
p311/p311_285|Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
p311/p311_268|There is no point in denying that.
p311/p311_379|It feels like a winner already.
p311/p311_213|It had to be more flexible.
p311/p311_107|Is there anything in the wound?
p311/p311_292|The attack was totally out of the blue.
p311/p311_410|This will be no easy option.
p311/p311_114|It is nearly there.
p311/p311_247|I believe in theatre.
p311/p311_103|These matters are now behind us.
p311/p311_239|It's not a party, no, no.
p311/p311_390|For us, that decision was hard to understand.
p311/p311_111|There could be no dispute about our history.
p311/p311_184|This may be perfectly innocent.
p311/p311_274|It doesn't seem like that long ago.
p311/p311_366|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p311/p311_197|He confirmed there had been no warning.
p311/p311_182|It was entirely justified.
p311/p311_339|And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
p311/p311_314|Yes, it was uplifting.
p311/p311_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p311/p311_116|I find it rather oppressive.
p311/p311_380|And it covers the spectrum.
p311/p311_402|She is a veteran in the Balkans.
p311/p311_264|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p311/p311_235|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p311/p311_212|But who will buy it?
p311/p311_065|Only one got through.
p311/p311_225|And it paid off.
p311/p311_355|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p311/p311_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
p311/p311_333|This time, however, may have been different.
p311/p311_394|They haven't run away.
p311/p311_201|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p311/p311_218|Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
p311/p311_057|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p311/p311_253|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p311/p311_124|This is a most serious matter.
p311/p311_295|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p311/p311_398|Who can say?
p311/p311_229|It should be scrapped.
p311/p311_146|They did not let him down.
p311/p311_087|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p311/p311_252|He has to pull back from the brink.
p311/p311_132|Did he always want to be a comedian?
p311/p311_129|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p311/p311_073|I have spoken to the skipper.
p311/p311_117|They are all Arabs.
p311/p311_374|I recommend a tour.
p311/p311_055|They should go ahead as normal.
p311/p311_361|The actors are confident and polished.
p311/p311_109|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p311/p311_220|The whole thing has been a nightmare.
p311/p311_354|So it goes on.
p311/p311_302|My position on the euro is quite clear.
p311/p311_036|Green is desperate to play in The Open.
p311/p311_165|There was nothing else to match it.
p311/p311_161|They never got into the show this time.
p311/p311_397|He said no survivors had been found.
p311/p311_164|He changed my life.
p311/p311_099|It's like an extension of your body.
p311/p311_042|There can be no two ways about it.
p311/p311_180|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p311/p311_033|She went home from school and never returned.
p311/p311_063|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p311/p311_093|It is set in Paris.
p311/p311_388|That argument has been won.
p311/p311_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p311/p311_032|We keep a distance.
p311/p311_373|And then he laughs.
p311/p311_283|My office is down there.
p311/p311_140|It's a horrific incident.
p311/p311_391|I had to calm down.
p311/p311_083|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p311/p311_267|There is no signature.
p311/p311_193|I have done ever since it was published.
p311/p311_207|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p311/p311_136|Parole isn't a decision for me.
p311/p311_108|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p311/p311_119|He decides to do something about it.
p311/p311_102|Which he is, too.
p311/p311_206|This has been a shock.
p311/p311_261|I want to go now.
p311/p311_263|Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
p311/p311_169|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p311/p311_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p311/p311_183|He looked at me before replying.
p311/p311_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p311/p311_304|We have worked well with them for years.
p311/p311_177|What kind of festival is proposed?
p311/p311_098|He's got me very well.
p311/p311_126|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p311/p311_175|His only reply was a laugh.
p311/p311_325|Not because they want to sing about something.
p311/p311_419|I feel very strongly about that.
p311/p311_319|It's a big challenge for the audience.
p311/p311_084|They are there to help us.
p311/p311_386|There are big names.
p311/p311_069|I have a choice.
p311/p311_223|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p311/p311_075|Craig is a major concern for us.
p311/p311_125|I let go the telephone and ran.
p311/p311_219|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p311/p311_251|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p311/p311_323|It will make a huge difference.
p311/p311_133|The way ahead is not easy.
p311/p311_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p311/p311_186|There will be no change in government.
p311/p311_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p311/p311_154|We have the easy part.
p311/p311_353|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p311/p311_128|It was a bit of a shock.
p311/p311_190|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p311/p311_266|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p311/p311_064|The scientific debate is dead.
p311/p311_158|It's there for people to look at.
p311/p311_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p311/p311_294|So there is a very real dilemma.
p311/p311_307|That is when we are really effective.
p311/p311_347|I've no problem with what they said.
p311/p311_341|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p311/p311_202|They are now out in the cold.
p311/p311_060|His third goal was superb.
p311/p311_061|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p311/p311_281|I am very happy with life.
p311/p311_337|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p311/p311_284|Even then this game was not over.
p311/p311_147|I believe in trade unions.
p311/p311_079|It's the same as Glasgow.
p311/p311_421|It's very difficult and very worrying.
p311/p311_415|They were outside the circle.
p311/p311_291|Shelter also supports the reform.
p311/p311_152|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p311/p311_044|I am content with the silver.
p311/p311_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p311/p311_407|We have reacted well to each other.
p311/p311_049|What would you do if you didn't work?
p311/p311_145|There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
p311/p311_322|If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
p311/p311_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p311/p311_348|He added that he felt undermined.
p311/p311_048|There are different cultures in different departments.
p311/p311_318|But this one has a lot of potential.
p311/p311_097|The initial report has been completed.
p311/p311_303|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p311/p311_249|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p311/p311_280|There are two ways to start a festival.
p311/p311_243|It has changed, and not for the better.
p311/p311_001|Please call Stella.
p311/p311_317|But don't just take my word, for it.
p311/p311_211|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p311/p311_315|Nobody should believe this story.
p311/p311_085|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p311/p311_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p311/p311_090|It is a very special place.
p311/p311_297|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p311/p311_067|He is a visionary.
p311/p311_130|Still, some additions are inspired.
p311/p311_131|Planning is a key issue.
p311/p311_395|Nobody can take it away from me.
p311/p311_041|We must learn to finish.
p311/p311_257|Faces from the Eighties.
p311/p311_401|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p311/p311_045|People acted too quickly.
p311/p311_232|We have to defend ourselves.
p311/p311_309|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p311/p311_241|It may not be life long.
p311/p311_378|We have to start again on Saturday.
p311/p311_160|At least two women were among those arrested.
p311/p311_168|The criteria have changed.
p311/p311_191|I have no battle with the Scots.
p311/p311_245|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p311/p311_368|I just did not cope with the pressure.
p311/p311_095|Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
p311/p311_106|He, too, will return.
p311/p311_217|This was a lot of numbers.
p311/p311_030|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p311/p311_077|I can't wait to meet him.
p311/p311_404|We're not the tourist board.
p311/p311_255|The film has also been superbly designed.
p311/p311_028|I was totally wrong.
p311/p311_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p311/p311_273|I've never seen a game like it.
p311/p311_392|Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
p311/p311_153|I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
p311/p311_293|There is a solution, she believes.
p311/p311_272|They still have the dirty work to do.
p311/p311_118|It is already making a difference.
p311/p311_135|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p311/p311_176|those who are preparing to give up.
p311/p311_416|The whole process was so different.
p311/p311_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p311/p311_054|As a nation, we must become more active.
p311/p311_238|Clearly he is keeping in touch.
p311/p311_150|The money is not really our concern.
p311/p311_031|Miller was every bit as happy.
p311/p311_305|That was me today.
p311/p311_155|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p311/p311_286|We also hope to meet the men.
p311/p311_382|And the winners are.
p311/p311_306|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p311/p311_086|My wife and family are the support system.
p311/p311_066|In the end, however, it all came together.
p311/p311_389|Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
p311/p311_230|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p311/p311_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p311/p311_143|We've not won anything yet.
p311/p311_035|With actors it is slightly different.
p311/p311_240|It's not that clear-cut.
p311/p311_250|It's time to say enough is enough.
p311/p311_277|There's a lot of hysteria.
p311/p311_396|She is fulfilled by it.
p311/p311_327|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p311/p311_151|You just know it.
p311/p311_159|The party will make up its own mind.
p311/p311_289|Fame and money followed.
p311/p311_256|The performance was really, really immense.
p311/p311_242|It was just above the roof.
p311/p311_050|They are already on the way there.
p311/p311_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p311/p311_351|It is physical but it is also good.
p311/p311_123|These figures are truly terrible.
p311/p311_227|Those Were The Days, indeed.
p311/p311_414|It worked well in Monaco.
p311/p311_101|Johnsen is equally concerned.
p311/p311_418|I agree with them.
p311/p311_200|Can you believe it?
p311/p311_121|Someone else has now got them.
p239/p239_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p239/p239_180|Does that put pressure on us?
p239/p239_427|This idea has been around for four years.
p239/p239_275|It's going to be very closely watched.
p239/p239_338|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p239/p239_072|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p239/p239_370|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p239/p239_265|They could not match it.
p239/p239_388|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p239/p239_107|There could be a way back.
p239/p239_413|We have no information on Iraq.
p239/p239_444|Any error is severely punished.
p239/p239_323|I won't make an official complaint.
p239/p239_456|Now it has doubled in size.
p239/p239_354|Are you going to win?
p239/p239_054|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p239/p239_064|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p239/p239_154|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p239/p239_045|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p239/p239_073|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p239/p239_344|The FBI could become involved.
p239/p239_372|That took about two years.
p239/p239_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p239/p239_056|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p239/p239_332|January is a bad time of year.
p239/p239_270|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p239/p239_473|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p239/p239_488|Holland won by five wickets.
p239/p239_335|From there, they can go anywhere.
p239/p239_428|Or maybe it's the other way around.
p239/p239_486|It happened again, and again, and again.
p239/p239_285|It has been recorded twice.
p239/p239_112|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p239/p239_447|Hard cash is needed now.
p239/p239_398|We were beaten by the better team.
p239/p239_472|We need a visionary producer.
p239/p239_039|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p239/p239_105|This time, it might be for real.
p239/p239_381|We have not been approached.
p239/p239_451|Either way, it's very funny.
p239/p239_368|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p239/p239_417|The baby deserves the credit.
p239/p239_300|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p239/p239_102|But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
p239/p239_242|And they were being paid?
p239/p239_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p239/p239_252|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p239/p239_422|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p239/p239_350|Translation - we got it wrong.
p239/p239_290|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p239/p239_240|They should stop the bombing.
p239/p239_225|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p239/p239_068|I'm pleased with the horse.
p239/p239_336|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p239/p239_476|Banking stocks were hit hard.
p239/p239_173|She is in good spirits.
p239/p239_278|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p239/p239_088|So what happens next?
p239/p239_380|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p239/p239_396|This fact is supported by audience research.
p239/p239_125|They lived for their children.
p239/p239_050|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p239/p239_150|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p239/p239_295|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p239/p239_289|This youngster is so exciting!
p239/p239_337|Twaddle is a case in point.
p239/p239_318|The result is utterly compelling.
p239/p239_172|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p239/p239_361|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p239/p239_206|My wife and family are the support system.
p239/p239_405|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p239/p239_183|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p239/p239_482|The death toll included five children.
p239/p239_200|It's been a humbling year.
p239/p239_478|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p239/p239_414|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p239/p239_193|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p239/p239_133|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p239/p239_196|Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
p239/p239_317|Who was she?
p239/p239_218|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p239/p239_266|He is not a pathetic figure.
p239/p239_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p239/p239_075|Let's not be too despondent.
p239/p239_341|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p239/p239_174|As if that is an achievement.
p239/p239_215|That group reported just before Christmas.
p239/p239_226|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p239/p239_129|What form did that take?
p239/p239_147|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p239/p239_291|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p239/p239_090|What do they want us to do?
p239/p239_357|So what is the campaign about?
p239/p239_466|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p239/p239_360|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p239/p239_137|Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
p239/p239_121|The error appeared in a warrant.
p239/p239_502|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p239/p239_435|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p239/p239_254|She replied, It could be.
p239/p239_316|I think, therefore I am?
p239/p239_490|They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
p239/p239_104|I am so proud of him.
p239/p239_452|We didn't want any trouble.
p239/p239_100|Sales are falling after years of growth.
p239/p239_410|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p239/p239_489|Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
p239/p239_446|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p239/p239_500|Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
p239/p239_423|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p239/p239_369|They are the innocent victims.
p239/p239_135|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p239/p239_274|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p239/p239_462|She failed in her action.
p239/p239_197|You've got to be vigilant.
p239/p239_098|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p239/p239_334|Royal Bank declined to comment.
p239/p239_123|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p239/p239_126|Their season has been consigned to history.
p239/p239_301|Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
p239/p239_030|It is about control of our economy.
p239/p239_177|There was a fossil on screen.
p239/p239_272|A winter of discontent awaits.
p239/p239_400|Analysts were impressed with progress made.
p239/p239_001|Please call Stella.
p239/p239_204|There was a fine line to tread.
p239/p239_355|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p239/p239_459|This is a great opportunity for us.
p239/p239_118|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p239/p239_448|Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
p239/p239_402|I have received no explanation.
p239/p239_484|Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
p239/p239_415|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p239/p239_099|We will pay their bills.
p239/p239_263|Our position remains the same.
p239/p239_386|Well, that's just a third district.
p239/p239_097|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p239/p239_319|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p239/p239_071|Then they scored two goals to win.
p239/p239_501|You are a different people.
p239/p239_256|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p239/p239_189|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p239/p239_246|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p239/p239_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p239/p239_333|And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
p239/p239_184|Structural changes were also required.
p239/p239_144|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p239/p239_148|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p239/p239_425|Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
p239/p239_347|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p239/p239_166|They exist in name alone.
p239/p239_378|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p239/p239_085|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p239/p239_106|He will be kept informed.
p239/p239_160|Nato has left them with no other option.
p239/p239_339|My daughter is an adult.
p239/p239_025|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p239/p239_260|I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
p239/p239_124|He was just a journalist.
p239/p239_485|I was there five months ago.
p239/p239_110|I can't remember a lot of it.
p239/p239_096|Kenny Miller might come through.
p239/p239_221|I was caught out a little bit.
p239/p239_138|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p239/p239_060|And they removed a Borderer.
p239/p239_491|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p239/p239_231|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p239/p239_310|Racism has no place in any sport.
p239/p239_093|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p239/p239_474|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p239/p239_032|That's all I was trying to do today.
p239/p239_209|He is a very talented player.
p239/p239_117|Those people must be accountable.
p239/p239_426|It certainly feels that way.
p239/p239_116|I've had it for the exams.
p239/p239_411|You can feel at home in China.
p239/p239_053|I remember that day well.
p239/p239_108|He was a lovely man.
p239/p239_430|We accept the new rules.
p239/p239_182|Do you think we are a top nation?
p239/p239_194|Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
p239/p239_450|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p239/p239_483|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p239/p239_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p239/p239_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p239/p239_181|Did it work?
p239/p239_186|That was just one night.
p239/p239_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p239/p239_238|Further details are expected later.
p239/p239_460|Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
p239/p239_069|He will need that machine.
p239/p239_230|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p239/p239_228|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p239/p239_395|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p239/p239_115|The partners are looking for answers.
p239/p239_429|We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
p239/p239_353|What happened in that game?
p239/p239_191|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p239/p239_406|This game is very evenly balanced.
p239/p239_277|They receive a high profile in the media.
p239/p239_352|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p239/p239_328|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p239/p239_251|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p239/p239_308|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p239/p239_283|We've had great things in the past.
p239/p239_101|It was exactly four months away.
p239/p239_035|I might well have done so already.
p239/p239_401|Everything has its place and purpose.
p239/p239_077|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p239/p239_040|After the match, do you?
p239/p239_224|But it's an enjoyable job.
p239/p239_192|My father died in childbirth.
p239/p239_325|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p239/p239_294|I saw them last week.
p239/p239_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p239/p239_276|It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
p239/p239_311|Celtic were the losers then.
p239/p239_407|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p239/p239_373|He is obviously very dangerous.
p239/p239_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p239/p239_178|Is it in the right place?
p239/p239_171|Those three weeks are totally lost.
p239/p239_113|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p239/p239_049|We must learn to finish.
p239/p239_176|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p239/p239_103|We have a major concern about enforcement action.
p239/p239_420|I should think so, too.
p239/p239_477|We did something about it.
p239/p239_163|I understand the medical concerns.
p239/p239_207|We are now working with full-time on future product.
p239/p239_165|This was a unique election.
p239/p239_419|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p239/p239_046|But not a penny has been paid.
p239/p239_241|These days are long gone.
p239/p239_367|But the rally was short-lived.
p239/p239_391|How are you, sir?
p239/p239_324|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p239/p239_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p239/p239_315|What are you not good at?
p239/p239_358|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p239/p239_438|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p239/p239_499|I am not unduly surprised.
p239/p239_220|Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
p239/p239_362|Walker plans to return indoors.
p239/p239_364|The statement contained no surprises.
p239/p239_109|People will have to be patient.
p239/p239_345|Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
p239/p239_304|That should give me a chance.
p239/p239_128|How independent is that?
p239/p239_305|They have played their part.
p239/p239_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p239/p239_307|They have the cash and the fire power.
p239/p239_457|It was never a free kick.
p239/p239_141|A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
p239/p239_441|The stage was set for a showdown.
p239/p239_143|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p239/p239_453|It seemed a logical expansion.
p239/p239_258|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p239/p239_185|His job was not advertised.
p239/p239_232|It would seem a natural progression.
p239/p239_343|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p239/p239_048|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p239/p239_443|They should not feel under threat.
p239/p239_044|It carried a double message.
p239/p239_140|So it was at Easter Road.
p239/p239_292|They will probably come back.
p239/p239_322|There were also some interesting questions and answers.
p239/p239_433|He was released after treatment.
p239/p239_267|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p239/p239_273|I thought we were fantastic.
p239/p239_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p239/p239_259|We have expanded too quickly.
p239/p239_297|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p239/p239_475|I am sorry, but I forgot.
p239/p239_463|We will provide immediate access.
p239/p239_467|Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
p239/p239_155|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p239/p239_424|The capital costs are modest.
p239/p239_029|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p239/p239_314|how do you get it back?
p239/p239_027|And so was a photograph.
p239/p239_237|Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
p239/p239_253|The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
p239/p239_287|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p239/p239_348|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p239/p239_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p239/p239_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p239/p239_175|Mr Blair should be warned.
p239/p239_223|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p239/p239_356|So, did she meet him?
p239/p239_296|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p239/p239_190|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p239/p239_412|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p239/p239_439|The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
p239/p239_042|Have I really come to this?
p239/p239_203|It is all to do with the coaching.
p239/p239_281|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p239/p239_149|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p239/p239_279|Miller was every bit as happy.
p239/p239_208|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p239/p239_249|This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
p239/p239_089|Had this been common practice?
p239/p239_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p239/p239_158|Our relationship has been very good.
p239/p239_195|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p239/p239_376|It was launched in February last year.
p239/p239_074|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p239/p239_284|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p239/p239_168|I can see it now.
p239/p239_081|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p239/p239_091|Is it worth it?
p239/p239_390|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p239/p239_416|You're not getting any goodwill.
p239/p239_247|I've learned from my mistakes.
p239/p239_269|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p239/p239_151|Which isn't a bad idea.
p239/p239_255|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p239/p239_062|Perhaps we should do the same.
p239/p239_248|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p239/p239_399|Both sides have to step back.
p239/p239_434|All the pieces fit together perfectly.
p239/p239_262|Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
p239/p239_375|This should come as no surprise.
p239/p239_384|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p239/p239_205|The refund is fully justified.
p239/p239_403|Turnover was highest in telecoms.
p239/p239_320|I have been very nervous.
p239/p239_214|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p239/p239_222|There's always the next century.
p239/p239_026|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p239/p239_199|Tiger is not the norm.
p239/p239_131|What are they for?
p239/p239_244|What was the matter for concern?
p239/p239_229|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p239/p239_394|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p239/p239_130|Are they free?
p239/p239_213|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p239/p239_359|William Hague delighted his party.
p239/p239_374|That remains the unanswered question.
p239/p239_210|Bottling is now the core business.
p239/p239_261|Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
p239/p239_111|Instead, another depression came in.
p239/p239_495|The whole thing was just unreal.
p239/p239_454|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p239/p239_187|This is a frightening development.
p239/p239_309|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p239/p239_127|Diversions were put in place.
p239/p239_092|Does it matter?
p239/p239_227|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p239/p239_280|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p239/p239_094|But I had never been in a theatre.
p239/p239_212|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p239/p239_153|That's what happened against Ayr.
p239/p239_243|was everything done to save people?
p239/p239_385|Those overseas offices were great.
p239/p239_119|The Festival is prepared to help.
p239/p239_349|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p239/p239_066|Everything is possible in football.
p239/p239_437|Things are going to change over the next six months.
p239/p239_479|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p239/p239_366|This would include the GM food industry.
p239/p239_492|MOVIE stars are public property.
p239/p239_409|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p239/p239_132|Is there a waiting list?
p239/p239_201|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p239/p239_497|They haven't been thought through.
p239/p239_037|He works at the airport.
p239/p239_330|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p239/p239_306|This will be our new beginning.
p239/p239_234|We will turn the corner.
p239/p239_216|We had to add value.
p239/p239_055|He is too weak to move.
p239/p239_408|It seems a waste of talents.
p239/p239_070|The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
p239/p239_134|Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
p239/p239_051|New York is my home.
p239/p239_057|I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
p239/p239_404|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p239/p239_058|Among them are many criminals.
p239/p239_363|The actual increases will be announced next month.
p239/p239_217|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p239/p239_063|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p239/p239_392|So is that it, then?
p239/p239_371|He ended up a headmaster.
p239/p239_494|The songs are just so good.
p239/p239_043|This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
p239/p239_365|The scientific debate is dead.
p239/p239_383|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p239/p239_167|We have reacted well to each other.
p239/p239_299|Everyone can have their opinion.
p239/p239_298|We may need to take some very radical measures.
p239/p239_122|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p239/p239_250|I've come here for the jersey.
p239/p239_468|The money is within the total allocation.
p239/p239_114|It is sometimes like that.
p239/p239_487|It could well be military.
p239/p239_271|Each case is treated on merit.
p239/p239_503|The world record is suspicious.
p239/p239_120|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p239/p239_327|They make a selective perception process.
p239/p239_432|They are interior designers and architects.
p239/p239_442|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p239/p239_418|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p239/p239_382|Murray Johnstone will replace it.
p239/p239_440|It is also very valuable.
p239/p239_179|Did he trip?
p239/p239_393|Do I have a favourite?
p239/p239_082|Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
p239/p239_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p239/p239_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p239/p239_321|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p239/p239_164|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p239/p239_465|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p239/p239_445|Either group is living in fantasy land.
p239/p239_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p239/p239_078|I haven't got there yet.
p239/p239_387|She asked for the appointment with me.
p239/p239_061|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p239/p239_086|Or so the theory goes.
p239/p239_288|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p239/p239_076|The Government does not go far enough.
p239/p239_377|Commitment is released on Liberty.
p239/p239_142|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p239/p239_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p239/p239_302|Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
p239/p239_080|They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
p239/p239_458|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p239/p239_469|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p239/p239_331|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p239/p239_257|We have a budget in March.
p239/p239_188|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p239/p239_219|So I got a blood test.
p239/p239_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p239/p239_312|What do we want to do that for?
p239/p239_342|I am considered a teenager.
p239/p239_033|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p239/p239_087|He has really done well.
p239/p239_079|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p239/p239_379|He did not say that.
p239/p239_146|He was forced to quit.
p239/p239_152|Since then, things have improved.
p239/p239_313|Does the name matter?
p239/p239_326|They are looking at a flotation.
p239/p239_303|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p239/p239_067|Everyone could see the joke.
p239/p239_455|And Michael was just great.
p239/p239_239|This is absolutely not true.
p239/p239_065|They desperately want some stability.
p239/p239_481|The rescue package is public money.
p239/p239_351|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p239/p239_471|There's nothing I can say.
p239/p239_431|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p239/p239_052|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p239/p239_268|They made such decisions in London.
p239/p239_041|Has the conflict started?
p239/p239_329|He was admitted to hospital.
p239/p239_202|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p239/p239_059|That's been the difference between the sides.
p239/p239_496|I can hardly believe it.
p239/p239_095|It was fun, but not a living.
p239/p239_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p239/p239_449|Blair also had a penalty.
p239/p239_480|Five years later, the deception continued.
p239/p239_047|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p239/p239_389|A new school will be built.
p239/p239_145|We just have to adapt.
p239/p239_156|It is a good lifestyle.
p239/p239_136|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p239/p239_245|Do I think about them often?
p239/p239_162|I think the referee was good.
p239/p239_397|Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
p239/p239_493|I first met him last summer.
p239/p239_464|We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
p239/p239_236|My Dad is a hero.
p239/p239_235|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p239/p239_198|He said the director had been completely friendly.
p239/p239_461|Inventories are coming under control.
p239/p239_421|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p239/p239_159|It was the climax of the thing.
p239/p239_139|It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
p239/p239_038|How do you take them away?
p239/p239_169|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p239/p239_436|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p239/p239_498|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p239/p239_211|I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
p239/p239_036|That can cost him a fortune.
p239/p239_170|There's still plenty time left.
p239/p239_031|There was a rush of water.
p239/p239_346|I just felt that I was broken down.
p239/p239_293|This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
p239/p239_340|It will affect their work.
p239/p239_286|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p239/p239_034|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p239/p239_233|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p239/p239_028|We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
p239/p239_282|There is no internal damage.
p239/p239_470|This does not create any precedent.
p239/p239_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p239/p239_161|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p239/p239_264|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p239/p239_084|And it had two seats.
p239/p239_157|Before the game we went for a pint.
p252/p252_291|I'm interested in interesting work.
p252/p252_382|He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
p252/p252_353|The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
p252/p252_074|Insurance will perhaps reduce.
p252/p252_275|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p252/p252_321|We lost to a poor team.
p252/p252_143|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p252/p252_226|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p252/p252_137|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p252/p252_296|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p252/p252_383|I got dropped for that game.
p252/p252_110|He gets his moment.
p252/p252_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p252/p252_209|The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
p252/p252_210|If not, a deal could take many months.
p252/p252_400|We will miss him against Celtic.
p252/p252_223|Brian was last to join.
p252/p252_139|It should have its own network.
p252/p252_211|Their bodies were never found.
p252/p252_088|That remains the same.
p252/p252_216|The questions came quick and fast.
p252/p252_069|It would have to be.
p252/p252_153|how do you get it back?
p252/p252_168|Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
p252/p252_145|We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
p252/p252_340|If we get the wrong candidate.
p252/p252_367|You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
p252/p252_046|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p252/p252_345|He would add value.
p252/p252_001|Please call Stella.
p252/p252_244|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p252/p252_191|She really suffered for her art.
p252/p252_063|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p252/p252_260|My goals have never changed.
p252/p252_201|What was the matter for concern?
p252/p252_333|But it won't help British farmers.
p252/p252_343|We are a husband and wife team.
p252/p252_356|Are they free?
p252/p252_292|His season started this afternoon.
p252/p252_355|What form did that take?
p252/p252_175|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p252/p252_268|But the next day she paid for it.
p252/p252_084|He has a real potential.
p252/p252_376|We have no information on Iraq.
p252/p252_215|Fine, said the press officer.
p252/p252_317|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p252/p252_313|It was a total surprise.
p252/p252_146|That is a big risk at any price.
p252/p252_371|He said legal action could be considered.
p252/p252_295|Kenny and I are ready.
p252/p252_306|We must move on.
p252/p252_027|It would fit very well with us.
p252/p252_161|I told them during their morning break.
p252/p252_039|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p252/p252_380|Next league matches Kilmarnock.
p252/p252_322|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p252/p252_391|I've kept him in touch with everything.
p252/p252_251|Perhaps it will happen again.
p252/p252_067|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
p252/p252_176|You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
p252/p252_066|Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
p252/p252_288|It was a bit like having children.
p252/p252_058|I agree with you about this.
p252/p252_183|I've no idea how it works.
p252/p252_121|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p252/p252_258|It was an accident.
p252/p252_406|Does it matter?
p252/p252_199|And they were being paid?
p252/p252_172|We have come a long way since then.
p252/p252_410|All the dead were believed to have been French.
p252/p252_140|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p252/p252_405|Is it worth it?
p252/p252_050|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p252/p252_029|Do not give your details to anyone.
p252/p252_150|Why change it?
p252/p252_334|Does that put pressure on us?
p252/p252_385|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p252/p252_284|Oil stocks also provided a boost.
p252/p252_381|An appeal was unlikely.
p252/p252_399|It was too difficult.
p252/p252_302|So does every industry.
p252/p252_364|Still, I am delighted.
p252/p252_044|Something old something new, as it were.
p252/p252_286|The future might well be green after all.
p252/p252_293|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p252/p252_241|That's been the difference between the sides.
p252/p252_404|What do they want us to do?
p252/p252_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p252/p252_056|He was failed by his health authority.
p252/p252_028|He does not even trust his own members.
p252/p252_181|Parents do not know very much about drugs.
p252/p252_335|Did it work?
p252/p252_173|Sport is good for you.
p252/p252_277|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p252/p252_354|Any increase always has some effect.
p252/p252_269|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p252/p252_255|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p252/p252_149|Was it the wife?
p252/p252_282|Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
p252/p252_366|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p252/p252_185|Maybe this battle had been.
p252/p252_170|The second failed completely.
p252/p252_342|They will now remain split up.
p252/p252_133|Eight others have followed.
p252/p252_203|Is it in the right place?
p252/p252_243|I did let myself down a bit.
p252/p252_136|Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
p252/p252_144|I'd always wanted to act.
p252/p252_118|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p252/p252_079|Do I have a favourite?
p252/p252_388|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p252/p252_062|For a decade she was proved right.
p252/p252_303|Tomorrow will be my last.
p252/p252_331|Our relationship has been very good.
p252/p252_104|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p252/p252_324|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p252/p252_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p252/p252_093|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p252/p252_178|All options are available.
p252/p252_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p252/p252_248|We have several options.
p252/p252_179|I knew Donald Dewar.
p252/p252_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p252/p252_098|We're at home, which is important.
p252/p252_092|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p252/p252_105|It would be easy to think so.
p252/p252_240|That time is not far away.
p252/p252_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p252/p252_332|Someone should tell them.
p252/p252_373|This is far too high.
p252/p252_078|So is that it, then?
p252/p252_026|This would include insurance.
p252/p252_075|Their time has gone.
p252/p252_218|Her experience is certainly limited.
p252/p252_087|Scotland has great assets.
p252/p252_184|It is actually building on the existing business.
p252/p252_196|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p252/p252_264|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p252/p252_278|Paul never gave up hope.
p252/p252_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p252/p252_165|They have shown great character.
p252/p252_213|Business will continue as usual.
p252/p252_099|They prepared some food very quickly.
p252/p252_194|A child is not a product.
p252/p252_182|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p252/p252_060|Must be prepared to use it.
p252/p252_375|If you believe in the blue and white.
p252/p252_123|They pointed to the site.
p252/p252_408|They had to have hospital treatment.
p252/p252_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p252/p252_042|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p252/p252_246|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p252/p252_126|Gold admitted as much.
p252/p252_080|What do we do?
p252/p252_188|London remained the favourite.
p252/p252_095|It looks that way.
p252/p252_323|We have clearly become well established.
p252/p252_337|Is our children learning?
p252/p252_156|Who was she?
p252/p252_193|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p252/p252_348|That was our last chance to do something.
p252/p252_131|Britain's role was to stop it.
p252/p252_077|How are you, sir?
p252/p252_386|This year I understood.
p252/p252_169|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p252/p252_206|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p252/p252_397|He has worked hard over the years.
p252/p252_208|The role was perfect for Russell.
p252/p252_108|Scotland were on Saturday.
p252/p252_113|It gets too much.
p252/p252_389|The women are victims here.
p252/p252_357|What are they for?
p252/p252_359|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p252/p252_338|How independent is that?
p252/p252_141|But this wasn't the full picture.
p252/p252_341|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p252/p252_316|Motherwell took them from half chances.
p252/p252_102|They had three children.
p252/p252_134|We're currently looking at the level of support.
p252/p252_212|It plans to return to this field.
p252/p252_224|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p252/p252_347|Those overseas offices were great.
p252/p252_037|Instead, we make the ground pay.
p252/p252_372|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p252/p252_082|What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick?
p252/p252_346|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p252/p252_190|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p252/p252_202|Do I think about them often?
p252/p252_155|I think, therefore I am?
p252/p252_394|He could still be President.
p252/p252_101|In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
p252/p252_122|Consumers will also benefit.
p252/p252_151|What do we want to do that for?
p252/p252_242|When I was training.
p252/p252_072|That is not possible.
p252/p252_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p252/p252_305|His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
p252/p252_271|This was the perfect setting.
p252/p252_351|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p252/p252_402|So what happens next?
p252/p252_266|Look at a computer.
p252/p252_308|We have achieved that.
p252/p252_207|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p252/p252_256|It is very much in the eye of the individual.
p252/p252_325|Murray plays down return
p252/p252_187|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p252/p252_238|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p252/p252_319|One finding emerged clearly.
p252/p252_300|Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
p252/p252_362|He was a great human being.
p252/p252_142|That shows the impact it had.
p252/p252_252|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p252/p252_204|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p252/p252_124|Tony Blair said as little.
p252/p252_090|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p252/p252_148|Are you going to win?
p252/p252_396|The new manager must make tough decisions.
p252/p252_157|He said some things which were better left alone.
p252/p252_025|Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
p252/p252_217|The Boys can speak about little else.
p252/p252_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p252/p252_352|No sport needs that sort of thing.
p252/p252_117|That is the only way to rate players.
p252/p252_407|The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
p252/p252_129|We beat the Welsh team.
p252/p252_267|He did better then.
p252/p252_228|The global market was about flat.
p252/p252_195|Which can happen any time.
p252/p252_130|I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
p252/p252_085|LET there be light.
p252/p252_307|It's just an area of water.
p252/p252_401|I managed to do that.
p252/p252_051|She continued to enjoy sport.
p252/p252_310|Good players have become bad.
p252/p252_163|Mr Dewar understood that.
p252/p252_263|He makes time for everyone.
p252/p252_220|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p252/p252_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p252/p252_254|We were leading by two goals.
p252/p252_311|Many events are down on numbers.
p252/p252_158|He nearly killed my son.
p252/p252_339|Because I think it's there.
p252/p252_186|Art can challenge our value system.
p252/p252_116|They need the money.
p252/p252_327|Not one person spoke badly.
p252/p252_369|Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
p252/p252_152|Does the name matter?
p252/p252_043|This operation will change her life.
p252/p252_227|Her death is a huge blow.
p252/p252_395|There's always a case.
p252/p252_038|That time may never be broken.
p252/p252_033|Just look at his fashion sense.
p252/p252_106|And so it went on.
p252/p252_289|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p252/p252_100|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p252/p252_294|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
p252/p252_225|Now the door has opened.
p252/p252_320|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p252/p252_132|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p252/p252_057|We wish to win, but not at any price.
p252/p252_089|It was exactly four months away.
p252/p252_304|But there's also a love for the songs.
p252/p252_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p252/p252_392|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p252/p252_378|The referee faces a massive job.
p252/p252_094|The car driver died.
p252/p252_200|was everything done to save people?
p252/p252_055|I think I'm a bit too young.
p252/p252_198|The hotel was huge.
p252/p252_344|It was the September weekend after all.
p252/p252_290|Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
p252/p252_236|There is a good reason for this.
p252/p252_309|Their eyes, however, told a different story.
p252/p252_053|By all accounts he was delighted.
p252/p252_229|Three hit the target.
p252/p252_109|We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
p252/p252_287|They were seriously after him.
p252/p252_076|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p252/p252_164|Nato has left them with no other option.
p252/p252_274|The long-term trend is equally clear.
p252/p252_247|It was a great evening.
p252/p252_239|The board do not own the company.
p252/p252_281|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p252/p252_384|No real attempt was made to get orders.
p252/p252_312|He had served his time.
p252/p252_032|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p252/p252_326|Other teams moved up too.
p252/p252_283|It is a dangerous sport.
p252/p252_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
p252/p252_097|We are already seeing some positive results.
p252/p252_127|It seemed like four hours.
p252/p252_299|He followed the Italian route.
p252/p252_231|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p252/p252_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p252/p252_235|Britain will be little affected.
p252/p252_273|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p252/p252_368|They made such decisions in London.
p252/p252_040|He too started on the subs seats.
p252/p252_221|The labour side had developed in the North area.
p252/p252_214|I want a free vote.
p252/p252_350|I saw one man vote five times.
p252/p252_065|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
p252/p252_387|It's clearly a budget.
p252/p252_232|It's used by Ayr Technical College.
p252/p252_034|I have every confidence.
p252/p252_120|No country has a similar training programme.
p252/p252_061|The fifth was found later.
p252/p252_154|What are you not good at?
p252/p252_091|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p252/p252_233|The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
p252/p252_329|The performance continues to improve.
p252/p252_393|There's nothing natural left.
p252/p252_071|This is a great opportunity for us.
p252/p252_234|We know the problems.
p252/p252_048|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p252/p252_205|This should begin in October.
p252/p252_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p252/p252_314|If a service doesn't pay it will go.
p252/p252_349|Maybe she is right.
p252/p252_250|Our focus remains on quality revenue.
p252/p252_047|That's what set him apart.
p252/p252_301|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p252/p252_083|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p252/p252_068|People come to see the Highlands.
p252/p252_409|Five local people were injured.
p252/p252_358|Is there a waiting list?
p252/p252_171|That apart, though, I feel good.
p252/p252_112|There was no reason.
p252/p252_237|You know the type.
p252/p252_370|The whole system is too complex.
p252/p252_280|They bought the property four years ago.
p252/p252_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p252/p252_054|Schools will not want change.
p252/p252_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p252/p252_128|Evidence must not be held back.
p252/p252_167|It wasn't a pretty match.
p252/p252_361|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p252/p252_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p252/p252_390|I'm not sure that's right.
p252/p252_363|That seems highly unlikely.
p252/p252_328|We were caught out.
p252/p252_162|Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
p252/p252_059|Or so he thought.
p252/p252_174|It was clearly not a battle.
p252/p252_222|Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
p252/p252_219|We tried four banks.
p252/p252_125|He is at peace with himself.
p252/p252_265|The proposal was rejected.
p252/p252_411|I'd like to report a murder.
p252/p252_030|Schools do not create that.
p252/p252_096|Now comes the hard part.
p252/p252_166|I am secure in my own position.
p252/p252_403|Had this been common practice?
p252/p252_330|We want immediate action.
p252/p252_160|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p252/p252_115|No progress has been made.
p252/p252_177|I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
p252/p252_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p252/p252_276|All films open tomorrow
p252/p252_230|The idea is simple.
p252/p252_197|Now he is back on top again.
p252/p252_103|Some young girls also came by last night.
p252/p252_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
p252/p252_086|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p252/p252_135|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p252/p252_379|That could be ready within another nine months.
p252/p252_336|Do you think we are a top nation?
p252/p252_081|Why do it otherwise?
p252/p252_315|The process will start tomorrow.
p252/p252_138|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p252/p252_041|I'm so happy that she did.
p252/p252_045|The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
p252/p252_253|It is based on population rather than need.
p252/p252_270|It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
p252/p252_052|Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
p252/p252_279|Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
p252/p252_119|Its failure is no surprise.
p252/p252_189|I've never had a year like this.
p252/p252_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p252/p252_114|So they should be.
p252/p252_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p252/p252_297|He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
p252/p252_298|They have played their part.
p252/p252_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p252/p252_365|Analysts welcomed the news.
p252/p252_036|We've got a real battle now with Richard.
p252/p252_262|So we kept them waiting.
p252/p252_035|He added that her comments were noted.
p252/p252_111|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p252/p252_073|None has ever been found.
p252/p252_360|They had better be.
p252/p252_374|These matters can't just be medical decisions.
p252/p252_245|This is absolutely not true.
p252/p252_064|Our people are ready.
p252/p252_147|I am never fully fit.
p275/p275_229|He is in the queue.
p275/p275_333|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p275/p275_059|This is the first step.
p275/p275_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p275/p275_217|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p275/p275_070|It's all I can do.
p275/p275_320|We are in the end game.
p275/p275_330|It's been hard.
p275/p275_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p275/p275_297|One was a lawyer.
p275/p275_335|He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
p275/p275_139|It was very frightened and dirty.
p275/p275_073|It works for us.
p275/p275_063|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p275/p275_151|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p275/p275_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p275/p275_331|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p275/p275_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p275/p275_031|There's a story, too.
p275/p275_403|It might be.
p275/p275_170|Tell it like it was?
p275/p275_242|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p275/p275_130|Twaddle is a case in point.
p275/p275_177|As we worked.
p275/p275_071|There could be a way back.
p275/p275_041|Dancing was her life.
p275/p275_257|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p275/p275_322|Off with their heads.
p275/p275_174|In a way he was.
p275/p275_050|Here's a clue.
p275/p275_360|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p275/p275_255|Is that a serious question?
p275/p275_259|Blood samples were taken.
p275/p275_383|It's like a basketball.
p275/p275_417|It all began as an accident.
p275/p275_241|Our policy is clear.
p275/p275_410|We went straight into the bedroom.
p275/p275_136|It's not true.
p275/p275_080|He is driven.
p275/p275_178|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p275/p275_253|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p275/p275_165|Well, he should know.
p275/p275_163|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p275/p275_053|It is unique.
p275/p275_009|There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p275/p275_294|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p275/p275_393|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p275/p275_193|Peace was won.
p275/p275_112|It is so sad.
p275/p275_233|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p275/p275_207|I don't want to use it.
p275/p275_428|And they replied.
p275/p275_340|This is a friendly match?
p275/p275_256|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p275/p275_104|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p275/p275_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p275/p275_126|She really suffered for her art.
p275/p275_273|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p275/p275_351|Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p275/p275_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p275/p275_353|It is not like us.
p275/p275_200|Tommy is not a problem.
p275/p275_380|It's a real problem.
p275/p275_095|May not have been at fault?
p275/p275_274|It's so awful.
p275/p275_072|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p275/p275_394|There were no immediate reports of injuries.
p275/p275_117|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p275/p275_183|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p275/p275_078|A review is under way.
p275/p275_148|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p275/p275_405|He scored a touchdown.
p275/p275_411|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p275/p275_399|It is an absolute nonsense.
p275/p275_231|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p275/p275_211|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p275/p275_361|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p275/p275_390|That set the tone.
p275/p275_025|But it failed.
p275/p275_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p275/p275_105|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p275/p275_075|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p275/p275_384|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p275/p275_062|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p275/p275_338|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p275/p275_416|He is to appeal.
p275/p275_051|I had come back from London.
p275/p275_336|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p275/p275_223|Saturday is gone.
p275/p275_377|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p275/p275_391|It was a breathtaking moment.
p275/p275_037|They're just different.
p275/p275_235|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p275/p275_160|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p275/p275_106|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p275/p275_049|He looks like an Afghan.
p275/p275_305|The plot is minimal.
p275/p275_389|But we are a young side.
p275/p275_084|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p275/p275_215|He seemed to lose his focus.
p275/p275_109|It's a shame.
p275/p275_099|Oil embargo endorsed.
p275/p275_300|It could work.
p275/p275_329|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p275/p275_404|Feel the air, the space.
p275/p275_203|But she might be.
p275/p275_279|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p275/p275_264|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p275/p275_339|Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
p275/p275_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p275/p275_082|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p275/p275_364|It's now down in black and white.
p275/p275_218|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p275/p275_127|It is not a U-turn.
p275/p275_064|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p275/p275_358|It is a memorial.
p275/p275_187|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p275/p275_042|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p275/p275_141|Is that it?
p275/p275_074|The party is up for it.
p275/p275_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p275/p275_415|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p275/p275_081|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p275/p275_184|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p275/p275_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p275/p275_226|I will win.
p275/p275_284|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p275/p275_086|It is a lifeline.
p275/p275_122|Who would have?
p275/p275_092|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p275/p275_159|They have not been named.
p275/p275_275|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p275/p275_118|It is rubbish.
p275/p275_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p275/p275_208|Feel the heat?
p275/p275_039|Indeed, he does.
p275/p275_418|We have to expand.
p275/p275_258|Souter will be back.
p275/p275_337|We are the gateway to justice.
p275/p275_365|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p275/p275_378|It is the old story.
p275/p275_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p275/p275_110|It was the eighties.
p275/p275_373|Something is wrong.
p275/p275_225|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p275/p275_266|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p275/p275_076|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p275/p275_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p275/p275_228|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p275/p275_423|It's been a long, long journey.
p275/p275_125|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p275/p275_346|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p275/p275_367|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p275/p275_142|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p275/p275_198|I have a cold.
p275/p275_425|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p275/p275_379|It looked like a river.
p275/p275_157|The weather forecast isn't good.
p275/p275_186|It's an idea.
p275/p275_219|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p275/p275_359|This is a club on the rise.
p275/p275_236|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p275/p275_299|There were no passengers on board.
p275/p275_348|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p275/p275_216|Work has started.
p275/p275_366|They have not done so this season so far.
p275/p275_368|There is no signature.
p275/p275_045|This represents a tough game for us.
p275/p275_091|I saw the whole thing.
p275/p275_230|My wife and family are the support system.
p275/p275_398|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p275/p275_131|The BBC was a disgrace.
p275/p275_263|That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
p275/p275_046|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p275/p275_327|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p275/p275_252|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p275/p275_239|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p275/p275_179|It is not either national standards or local control.
p275/p275_238|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p275/p275_175|One season, they might do well.
p275/p275_309|The minister is the engineer.
p275/p275_145|Who would be right?
p275/p275_103|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
p275/p275_227|The report is due out next month.
p275/p275_085|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p275/p275_350|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p275/p275_392|What happened in the summer?
p275/p275_262|This is a question of Islam.
p275/p275_376|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p275/p275_090|But I was wrong.
p275/p275_409|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p275/p275_363|He's been in a nursing home for two years.
p275/p275_194|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p275/p275_101|He takes the job.
p275/p275_191|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p275/p275_079|He had suffered a heart attack.
p275/p275_307|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p275/p275_260|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p275/p275_096|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p275/p275_197|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p275/p275_265|It's very nice.
p275/p275_385|It can help.
p275/p275_352|The pair are very much in love.
p275/p275_060|It's good news and long overdue.
p275/p275_426|I want a career.
p275/p275_055|There's a danger.
p275/p275_222|We could easily be cut again.
p275/p275_325|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p275/p275_098|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p275/p275_342|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p275/p275_048|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p275/p275_212|It had all been arranged.
p275/p275_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p275/p275_036|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p275/p275_290|I could never be cool.
p275/p275_210|You have a plan?
p275/p275_057|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p275/p275_192|It is a farce.
p275/p275_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p275/p275_314|We have got to get the points from this one.
p275/p275_181|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p275/p275_188|Four policemen were wounded.
p275/p275_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p275/p275_205|Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
p275/p275_077|I will miss him.
p275/p275_043|We will push.
p275/p275_293|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p275/p275_214|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p275/p275_169|We've all had the shots.
p275/p275_162|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p275/p275_371|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p275/p275_250|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p275/p275_146|No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
p275/p275_040|Sadly, it can't.
p275/p275_356|We will be homeless.
p275/p275_199|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p275/p275_069|He was at home with his pals.
p275/p275_108|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p275/p275_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
p275/p275_301|This is a war over our home.
p275/p275_066|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p275/p275_209|He knows a lot.
p275/p275_247|It was a hit.
p275/p275_087|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p275/p275_054|That's the truth.
p275/p275_089|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p275/p275_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p275/p275_406|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p275/p275_374|You can cope with it.
p275/p275_135|What will happen then?
p275/p275_387|They are good.
p275/p275_033|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p275/p275_310|The letters are going out today.
p275/p275_369|I am a wealthy person.
p275/p275_058|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p275/p275_143|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p275/p275_234|Of course I was tempted.
p275/p275_196|I came home by ambulance.
p275/p275_047|Among them are many criminals.
p275/p275_115|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p275/p275_156|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p275/p275_061|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p275/p275_189|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p275/p275_137|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p275/p275_424|We are now up against it.
p275/p275_313|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p275/p275_034|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p275/p275_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p275/p275_282|It was a virus.
p275/p275_094|It is a love affair.
p275/p275_150|We have the location, which is assured.
p275/p275_285|It was good.
p275/p275_296|She is really magic.
p275/p275_093|Hartley should know.
p275/p275_402|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p275/p275_129|Who will attend?
p275/p275_419|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p275/p275_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p275/p275_038|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p275/p275_102|She reflects a bit.
p275/p275_052|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p275/p275_427|He deserved a red card.
p275/p275_323|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p275/p275_308|You should be.
p275/p275_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p275/p275_123|That's all right then.
p275/p275_295|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p275/p275_243|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p275/p275_032|He was jailed for four years.
p275/p275_321|Our message was inclusive.
p275/p275_044|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p275/p275_027|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p275/p275_344|There may be reasons for it.
p275/p275_289|We are not going to forget.
p275/p275_100|There were no grounds for his action.
p275/p275_413|I am extremely cautious.
p275/p275_251|Kirkwood was arrested.
p275/p275_167|These days are long gone.
p275/p275_272|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p275/p275_396|What was the difference between them?
p275/p275_068|Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
p275/p275_269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p275/p275_349|She is free.
p275/p275_388|I'm glad I came.
p275/p275_303|The court had a number of empty seats.
p275/p275_276|We are a grandmother.
p275/p275_201|Who will pay for this?
p275/p275_395|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p275/p275_224|It's the Tate.
p275/p275_315|My whole life has changed.
p275/p275_147|He realises his mistake.
p275/p275_286|Who did the recruiting?
p275/p275_414|Paris is not only young.
p275/p275_113|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p275/p275_244|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p275/p275_237|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p275/p275_124|I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
p275/p275_083|They lived for their children.
p275/p275_121|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p275/p275_386|I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
p275/p275_400|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p275/p275_180|He deserved the win.
p275/p275_334|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p275/p275_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p275/p275_028|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p275/p275_088|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p275/p275_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p275/p275_067|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p275/p275_271|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p275/p275_292|There was a vacuum.
p275/p275_429|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p275/p275_166|Was this element always there?
p275/p275_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p275/p275_347|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p275/p275_140|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p275/p275_240|It is hard won.
p275/p275_343|Tell us about it.
p275/p275_065|Try to save us.
p275/p275_302|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p275/p275_407|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p275/p275_056|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p275/p275_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p275/p275_281|You've got to have both sides.
p275/p275_220|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p275/p275_370|Colour was at the core of his life.
p275/p275_304|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p275/p275_408|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p275/p275_190|What has caused the demise of singing?
p275/p275_128|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p275/p275_278|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p275/p275_277|He looked very sharp.
p275/p275_001|Please call Stella.
p275/p275_111|It is a financial matter.
p275/p275_355|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p275/p275_324|My view has now completely changed.
p275/p275_326|Is that an issue?
p275/p275_381|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p275/p275_345|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p275/p275_421|I know the worry over Iraq.
p275/p275_213|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p275/p275_176|Is Saddam a threat?
p275/p275_168|I was in the train station overnight.
p275/p275_291|Who can predict?
p275/p275_246|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p275/p275_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p275/p275_164|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p275/p275_422|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p275/p275_158|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p275/p275_134|It plans to return to this field.
p275/p275_317|Kids are terrible.
p275/p275_312|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p275/p275_249|I can't get a job.
p275/p275_161|It was by the numbers.
p275/p275_288|Bombing slaughter rejected
p275/p275_268|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p275/p275_144|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p275/p275_097|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p275/p275_382|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p275/p275_116|It's not fair.
p275/p275_362|The death rates are still as high.
p275/p275_138|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p275/p275_287|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p275/p275_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p275/p275_185|His name was unknown.
p275/p275_372|It is hard to understand.
p275/p275_357|That would help.
p275/p275_270|It was very fast.
p275/p275_133|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p275/p275_171|Seven people were later detained by police.
p275/p275_114|The mood is upbeat.
p275/p275_375|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p275/p275_283|Yet, it worked.
p275/p275_152|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p275/p275_298|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p275/p275_173|You had to go and see him.
p275/p275_354|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p275/p275_332|Who will do it?
p275/p275_311|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p275/p275_420|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p275/p275_154|So I got a blood test.
p275/p275_328|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p275/p275_149|I was awful.
p275/p275_341|I got a yellow card.
p275/p275_155|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p275/p275_132|I am now unemployed.
p275/p275_172|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p275/p275_316|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p275/p275_306|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p275/p275_195|Yet the data is compelling.
p275/p275_248|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p275/p275_182|Tony had arrived.
p275/p275_261|It will be done in stages.
p275/p275_119|Who would be a referee?
p275/p275_153|I am just trying to do my job.
p275/p275_221|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p275/p275_397|He will be judged by his actions.
p287/p287_113|There were no grounds for his action.
p287/p287_343|In the old days, it was easy.
p287/p287_397|Safety was also an issue.
p287/p287_198|However, it is not as simple as this.
p287/p287_144|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p287/p287_172|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p287/p287_346|Other people had looked at it.
p287/p287_109|So, did she meet him?
p287/p287_385|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p287/p287_272|And they were being paid?
p287/p287_135|We will provide immediate access.
p287/p287_273|was everything done to save people?
p287/p287_226|Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
p287/p287_189|Last night was a key episode.
p287/p287_342|A Home Office spokesman said.
p287/p287_326|After some discussion they did.
p287/p287_123|I felt he was excellent.
p287/p287_264|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p287/p287_325|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p287/p287_230|And thought we would get away with it.
p287/p287_424|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p287/p287_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p287/p287_095|It would be the end of farming.
p287/p287_228|We have learned a tremendous amount.
p287/p287_411|It certainly appeared that way.
p287/p287_406|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p287/p287_196|This will be our new beginning.
p287/p287_408|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
p287/p287_356|Appointments should be made on merit.
p287/p287_276|Is it in the right place?
p287/p287_295|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p287/p287_222|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p287/p287_259|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p287/p287_257|The concerns are the same.
p287/p287_030|Life was like a timetable.
p287/p287_255|That you can do it.
p287/p287_220|The red card was okay.
p287/p287_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p287/p287_103|That was the first step.
p287/p287_163|Tomorrow is a new day.
p287/p287_362|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p287/p287_265|They must play for each other.
p287/p287_369|It is a stroke of genius.
p287/p287_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p287/p287_066|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p287/p287_174|They bought the property four years ago.
p287/p287_376|The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
p287/p287_027|Meetings will also remain private.
p287/p287_351|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p287/p287_372|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p287/p287_323|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p287/p287_241|It was a fairy tale.
p287/p287_328|It wasn't a good day for us.
p287/p287_028|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p287/p287_305|The answer is with ourselves.
p287/p287_384|The pair are very much in love.
p287/p287_160|Phase one was a shambles.
p287/p287_105|Such actions are rarely popular.
p287/p287_392|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p287/p287_139|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p287/p287_390|There was a substantial explosion.
p287/p287_382|This remains the party's policy.
p287/p287_297|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p287/p287_254|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p287/p287_358|Even the one she loved.
p287/p287_308|I can hardly believe it.
p287/p287_409|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p287/p287_049|It is quite a figure.
p287/p287_058|How are you, sir?
p287/p287_235|I was ready for this.
p287/p287_162|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p287/p287_229|She died in middle age.
p287/p287_223|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p287/p287_303|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p287/p287_206|Who was she?
p287/p287_423|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p287/p287_037|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p287/p287_285|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p287/p287_044|I had come back from London.
p287/p287_313|They are not left wing.
p287/p287_090|Two of the team became ill.
p287/p287_311|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p287/p287_391|But we are very near.
p287/p287_374|They should take their mobile phones.
p287/p287_398|Had this been common practice?
p287/p287_401|Does it matter?
p287/p287_373|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p287/p287_225|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p287/p287_149|That shows the strength of the US Tour.
p287/p287_334|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p287/p287_071|It looks like a hit.
p287/p287_178|Being investor ready is a good start.
p287/p287_337|My whole life has changed.
p287/p287_240|He would not impose a fine.
p287/p287_104|I was impressed with them.
p287/p287_083|It was not an insult.
p287/p287_355|I'd like to take the plunge.
p287/p287_413|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p287/p287_165|Are you going to win?
p287/p287_284|And Michael was just great.
p287/p287_176|He is believed to live in Britain.
p287/p287_278|As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
p287/p287_238|My future is in the marathon.
p287/p287_182|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p287/p287_353|It's wonderful to have won.
p287/p287_136|It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
p287/p287_271|This is a question of Islam.
p287/p287_270|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p287/p287_290|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p287/p287_347|They are now out in the cold.
p287/p287_216|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p287/p287_179|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p287/p287_274|What was the matter for concern?
p287/p287_227|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p287/p287_181|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p287/p287_315|I was brought up in a mining background.
p287/p287_233|This is a family club.
p287/p287_079|That was a great performance by the team.
p287/p287_166|Was it the wife?
p287/p287_414|YOU thought it was a headache.
p287/p287_098|We have got a race.
p287/p287_404|No, because it was too many.
p287/p287_057|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p287/p287_292|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p287/p287_126|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p287/p287_405|It's too close to call.
p287/p287_053|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p287/p287_099|He will go on the bench.
p287/p287_304|We can work all night.
p287/p287_336|It was an achievement all right.
p287/p287_403|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p287/p287_047|There was no safety net.
p287/p287_319|We have a good healthy debate.
p287/p287_224|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p287/p287_283|It was an easy decision to come here.
p287/p287_419|It was important to win the singles.
p287/p287_314|McNaughton was not so sure.
p287/p287_055|You do not change overnight.
p287/p287_234|They need to win a trophy.
p287/p287_221|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p287/p287_199|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p287/p287_152|You had to go and see him.
p287/p287_377|There is a cup final at stake.
p287/p287_344|I think it's about time.
p287/p287_100|You had better believe it.
p287/p287_211|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p287/p287_318|This is a war over our home.
p287/p287_338|We are a peaceful people.
p287/p287_029|He has the courage of the unaware.
p287/p287_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p287/p287_275|Do I think about them often?
p287/p287_051|It depends on the couple.
p287/p287_106|Mr Blair should be warned.
p287/p287_389|It gets into the culture.
p287/p287_157|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p287/p287_249|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p287/p287_148|I am a good player.
p287/p287_035|That period was a struggle.
p287/p287_070|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p287/p287_096|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p287/p287_281|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p287/p287_045|I saw them last week.
p287/p287_212|It had all been arranged.
p287/p287_277|Did he trip?
p287/p287_205|I think, therefore I am?
p287/p287_033|I thought it was an accident.
p287/p287_341|The problems began a long time ago.
p287/p287_056|We will pay their bills.
p287/p287_107|Why do it otherwise?
p287/p287_067|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p287/p287_360|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p287/p287_093|Before the game we went for a pint.
p287/p287_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p287/p287_208|From there, they can go anywhere.
p287/p287_062|It has been an amazing day.
p287/p287_262|They are very keen to work with us.
p287/p287_054|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p287/p287_410|That is the ultimate revenge.
p287/p287_050|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p287/p287_357|I have a moral dilemma.
p287/p287_282|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p287/p287_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p287/p287_108|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p287/p287_125|The money needs to go to the front line.
p287/p287_412|They are looking for profit.
p287/p287_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p287/p287_204|What are you not good at?
p287/p287_312|This will secure the future of our industry.
p287/p287_367|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p287/p287_158|This much I can tell you.
p287/p287_155|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p287/p287_073|I first met him last summer.
p287/p287_232|The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
p287/p287_299|The rescue package is public money.
p287/p287_417|There is a solution, she believes.
p287/p287_361|They were the acts of men.
p287/p287_301|That is the general feeling.
p287/p287_236|I am still waiting for a reply.
p287/p287_364|Three years ago he would have been.
p287/p287_365|He did a good job.
p287/p287_349|It is a strong case.
p287/p287_085|It was clear on Thursday.
p287/p287_074|We did it for the jersey.
p287/p287_329|The show is at an end.
p287/p287_042|Must be prepared to use it.
p287/p287_287|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p287/p287_154|The people are the hero.
p287/p287_324|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
p287/p287_291|We have to be very, very careful.
p287/p287_407|I decided to take my time.
p287/p287_306|Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
p287/p287_032|But a solution has been found.
p287/p287_298|But it is up again.
p287/p287_133|I would relish the prospect.
p287/p287_332|What are they for?
p287/p287_180|We've had great things in the past.
p287/p287_128|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p287/p287_267|There's not much money in cycling.
p287/p287_366|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p287/p287_237|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p287/p287_293|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p287/p287_378|It's only a matter of scale.
p287/p287_348|It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
p287/p287_213|His third goal was superb.
p287/p287_294|If not, he should go home.
p287/p287_340|You may have a short memory.
p287/p287_363|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p287/p287_087|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p287/p287_402|Motion described it as a unique event.
p287/p287_309|Nothing has been put into action.
p287/p287_075|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p287/p287_300|Either team will be hard.
p287/p287_161|The hotel was now for sale.
p287/p287_065|This is a big step up.
p287/p287_185|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p287/p287_159|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p287/p287_296|Size is not the issue.
p287/p287_137|Three hours later, the man was free.
p287/p287_416|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p287/p287_307|There is no evidence for that.
p287/p287_143|We will turn the corner.
p287/p287_171|Says the Duke of York.
p287/p287_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p287/p287_188|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p287/p287_394|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p287/p287_200|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p287/p287_250|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p287/p287_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p287/p287_248|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p287/p287_038|Among them are many criminals.
p287/p287_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p287/p287_193|I was inspired by two things.
p287/p287_400|Is it worth it?
p287/p287_194|They might be surprised by the response.
p287/p287_327|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p287/p287_247|Persuaded to change his mind.
p287/p287_094|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p287/p287_261|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p287/p287_151|The pension levels will remain the same.
p287/p287_102|There's still plenty time left.
p287/p287_286|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p287/p287_001|Please call Stella.
p287/p287_142|It would seem a natural progression.
p287/p287_239|The effects are not all bad.
p287/p287_068|Now the plot is perfect.
p287/p287_081|I've never seen anything like it.
p287/p287_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p287/p287_217|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p287/p287_380|There is no deal as yet.
p287/p287_197|The service from the other players was super.
p287/p287_052|I expect a rapid response.
p287/p287_321|I have signed a contract.
p287/p287_203|how do you get it back?
p287/p287_258|We are in a war.
p287/p287_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p287/p287_078|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p287/p287_418|Potions said he would drive.
p287/p287_209|I had relied on him.
p287/p287_112|Then again, we could have.
p287/p287_322|It is a court case.
p287/p287_169|His son is a local legend.
p287/p287_146|The strong pound also took its toll.
p287/p287_375|SE is well down that road.
p287/p287_150|We have a budget in March.
p287/p287_354|He was then replaced by Ross.
p287/p287_215|His second was a beauty.
p287/p287_061|What do we do?
p287/p287_114|We have a training class.
p287/p287_122|He is a great addition to our team.
p287/p287_242|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p287/p287_415|I am astonished at attack.
p287/p287_080|It was a total disaster.
p287/p287_202|Does the name matter?
p287/p287_167|Why change it?
p287/p287_335|So what happens next?
p287/p287_168|What do we want to do that for?
p287/p287_279|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p287/p287_260|We run within the law.
p287/p287_036|This represents a tough game for us.
p287/p287_331|Are they free?
p287/p287_039|But it might have done.
p287/p287_141|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p287/p287_175|They need to look after themselves.
p287/p287_370|The members have voted against it.
p287/p287_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p287/p287_310|You are a different people.
p287/p287_333|Is there a waiting list?
p287/p287_218|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p287/p287_184|They were seriously after him.
p287/p287_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p287/p287_031|This is a central issue.
p287/p287_116|We did what we had to do.
p287/p287_040|There is no reason at all.
p287/p287_317|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p287/p287_387|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p287/p287_330|What form did that take?
p287/p287_110|So what is the campaign about?
p287/p287_120|You are a gambling man.
p287/p287_145|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p287/p287_231|We were a load of rubbish.
p287/p287_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p287/p287_129|We had to add value.
p287/p287_388|My dad is all right.
p287/p287_097|It's not a lack of confidence.
p287/p287_088|But I know the course.
p287/p287_187|It caused a lot of upset.
p287/p287_043|He will need that machine.
p287/p287_263|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p287/p287_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p287/p287_395|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p287/p287_046|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p287/p287_138|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p287/p287_210|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p287/p287_131|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p287/p287_359|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p287/p287_170|I am not ready to walk away.
p287/p287_121|My conscience is not clear.
p287/p287_190|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p287/p287_252|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p287/p287_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p287/p287_124|We will try to find someone.
p287/p287_140|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p287/p287_072|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p287/p287_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p287/p287_156|The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
p287/p287_130|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p287/p287_280|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p287/p287_091|No, the equipment is extra.
p287/p287_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p287/p287_302|It has to be an event.
p287/p287_086|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p287/p287_089|We intend to change the model.
p287/p287_371|We knew he was very creative.
p287/p287_092|This decision is a farce.
p287/p287_251|I should think so, too.
p287/p287_421|That's been all around Europe with me.
p287/p287_147|These days are long gone.
p287/p287_269|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p287/p287_396|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p287/p287_352|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p287/p287_386|It was like a vacuum.
p287/p287_268|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p287/p287_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p287/p287_207|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p287/p287_063|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p287/p287_214|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p287/p287_381|It's as wide as a church in here.
p287/p287_183|You know the sort of thing.
p287/p287_244|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p287/p287_153|They could not match it.
p287/p287_345|The airport was even different.
p287/p287_201|Getting this right is essential.
p287/p287_134|It has become a way of life.
p287/p287_048|The teacher would have approved.
p287/p287_127|I miss the freedom that I had.
p287/p287_034|President Bush is at war.
p287/p287_368|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p287/p287_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p287/p287_111|And does it?
p287/p287_191|It is hard to tell.
p287/p287_177|People like to talk about these things.
p287/p287_420|I'm pleased about one thing.
p287/p287_060|Do I have a favourite?
p287/p287_059|So is that it, then?
p287/p287_084|In each case they were a goal down.
p287/p287_399|What do they want us to do?
p287/p287_266|It is also very valuable.
p287/p287_041|This will get their attention.
p287/p287_243|She took them for a term.
p287/p287_173|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p287/p287_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p287/p287_422|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p287/p287_115|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p287/p287_026|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p287/p287_192|I can't play the game for them.
p287/p287_379|I do not like to lose.
p287/p287_064|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p287/p287_289|She failed in her action.
p287/p287_069|That would be too easy.
p287/p287_077|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p287/p287_256|He was on a horse.
p287/p287_316|The City welcomed the numbers.
p287/p287_383|They will fight for everything.
p287/p287_320|And he goes with it.
p287/p287_164|What happened in that game?
p287/p287_339|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p287/p287_186|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p287/p287_288|It was never a free kick.
p287/p287_118|She was also very brave.
p287/p287_082|He added that he felt undermined.
p287/p287_350|My view has now completely changed.
p287/p287_246|On a practical level, it would be difficult.
p287/p287_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p287/p287_119|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p287/p287_245|But that's another story for another day.
p287/p287_101|New Year will be very busy.
p287/p287_253|No production contract is yet in sight.
p287/p287_076|By then, he was walking on water.
p287/p287_132|That is the real test.
p287/p287_393|It has only been rumours.
p287/p287_117|They made such decisions in London.
p287/p287_219|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p287/p287_195|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p287/p287_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p270/p270_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p270/p270_256|Labour was too busy to respond.
p270/p270_096|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p270/p270_462|Something happened on that island.
p270/p270_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p270/p270_172|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p270/p270_419|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p270/p270_072|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p270/p270_138|They made such decisions in London.
p270/p270_186|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p270/p270_405|Ferguson must take the blame.
p270/p270_341|There was some merit in that.
p270/p270_058|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p270/p270_269|I'd never run for them.
p270/p270_119|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p270/p270_113|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p270/p270_180|City sentiment is in his favour.
p270/p270_105|I understand the medical concerns.
p270/p270_111|The website has changed the company.
p270/p270_318|He has left the company.
p270/p270_188|That's not fair to the supporters.
p270/p270_349|Nobody said it was required.
p270/p270_124|I've never seen a game like it.
p270/p270_209|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p270/p270_086|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p270/p270_375|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p270/p270_062|We have made a commitment to those people.
p270/p270_038|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p270/p270_362|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p270/p270_441|It is not over by any means.
p270/p270_196|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p270/p270_167|We did what we had to do.
p270/p270_152|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p270/p270_169|She returned to the theatre.
p270/p270_057|Because we do not need it.
p270/p270_425|It was a breathtaking moment.
p270/p270_400|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p270/p270_098|In the end we made too many errors.
p270/p270_084|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p270/p270_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p270/p270_327|There will be good prospects ahead.
p270/p270_352|Whether this return was too soon.
p270/p270_267|It is probably in the culture.
p270/p270_089|They must be on commission.
p270/p270_313|I was brought up in a mining background.
p270/p270_046|I had come back from London.
p270/p270_102|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p270/p270_201|In France, the reverse is true.
p270/p270_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p270/p270_296|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p270/p270_337|The next week is crucial.
p270/p270_369|He was then replaced by Ross.
p270/p270_225|Does that put pressure on us?
p270/p270_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p270/p270_319|What happened in that game?
p270/p270_384|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p270/p270_334|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p270/p270_445|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p270/p270_183|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p270/p270_433|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p270/p270_115|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p270/p270_227|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p270/p270_360|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p270/p270_189|They bought the property four years ago.
p270/p270_386|She is obviously very disappointed.
p270/p270_198|I know every village and island on the west coast.
p270/p270_048|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p270/p270_131|What are they for?
p270/p270_212|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p270/p270_398|There was a substantial explosion.
p270/p270_116|The problem was a social problem.
p270/p270_070|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p270/p270_258|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p270/p270_064|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p270/p270_029|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p270/p270_315|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p270/p270_213|They are looking at a flotation.
p270/p270_259|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p270/p270_428|The woman is basically off her head.
p270/p270_044|Not if you know the person.
p270/p270_277|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p270/p270_308|The songs are just so good.
p270/p270_174|There is no signature on this document.
p270/p270_444|It shows the right amount of progress.
p270/p270_026|They will not be allowed to succeed.
p270/p270_392|I always knew she was funny.
p270/p270_181|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p270/p270_063|Have a look at our accounts.
p270/p270_345|So what is the campaign about?
p270/p270_068|Then followed a bout of flu.
p270/p270_056|After the match, do you?
p270/p270_126|But we could only help a handful of people.
p270/p270_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p270/p270_312|There was no hint of scandal.
p270/p270_399|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p270/p270_395|It sounds like a wish list.
p270/p270_141|I feel very grateful with everything.
p270/p270_443|They are interior designers and architects.
p270/p270_407|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p270/p270_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p270/p270_335|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p270/p270_310|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p270/p270_440|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p270/p270_151|It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
p270/p270_314|Job losses were also announced.
p270/p270_081|They lived for their children.
p270/p270_231|Yet the evidence is plain to see.
p270/p270_254|This is a historic occasion.
p270/p270_065|Final proposals will be published in February.
p270/p270_147|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p270/p270_353|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p270/p270_326|Survival is not an option.
p270/p270_047|I had trouble with the producers.
p270/p270_460|They're just a good retailer.
p270/p270_054|How do you take them away?
p270/p270_241|The scientific debate is dead.
p270/p270_396|They have not got anyone.
p270/p270_220|It had all been arranged.
p270/p270_452|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p270/p270_381|So is that it, then?
p270/p270_245|This would include the GM food industry.
p270/p270_291|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p270/p270_148|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p270/p270_149|We will provide immediate access.
p270/p270_370|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p270/p270_203|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p270/p270_366|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p270/p270_200|He should emerge as the winner.
p270/p270_355|It's wonderful to have won.
p270/p270_391|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p270/p270_165|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p270/p270_088|The peace process will be buried!
p270/p270_050|He also presented You Bet!
p270/p270_091|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p270/p270_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p270/p270_001|Please call Stella.
p270/p270_223|Is it in the right place?
p270/p270_382|What do we do?
p270/p270_090|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p270/p270_067|It wasn't possible to relax.
p270/p270_442|It deserved to be a winner.
p270/p270_317|The pound has also suffered.
p270/p270_411|That is the ultimate revenge.
p270/p270_103|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p270/p270_331|It will set the tone.
p270/p270_248|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p270/p270_282|Any error is severely punished.
p270/p270_393|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p270/p270_074|It is not in my nature.
p270/p270_339|My body is clearly capable.
p270/p270_146|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p270/p270_130|Are they free?
p270/p270_073|She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
p270/p270_101|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p270/p270_290|It involved the same people.
p270/p270_110|You had better believe it.
p270/p270_412|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p270/p270_132|Is there a waiting list?
p270/p270_320|Are you going to win?
p270/p270_094|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p270/p270_272|I think, therefore I am?
p270/p270_143|Before it was an ordeal.
p270/p270_076|It was a unanimous decision.
p270/p270_045|That was the theory, anyway.
p270/p270_249|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p270/p270_176|They could not match it.
p270/p270_448|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p270/p270_262|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p270/p270_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p270/p270_159|Is our children learning?
p270/p270_457|We will deal with the refugees.
p270/p270_235|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p270/p270_322|Why change it?
p270/p270_120|You can spend money on housing.
p270/p270_202|I came home by ambulance.
p270/p270_043|Must be prepared to use it.
p270/p270_197|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p270/p270_357|This decision is a farce.
p270/p270_123|Those people must be accountable.
p270/p270_182|I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
p270/p270_435|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p270/p270_429|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p270/p270_373|I came here this week to work.
p270/p270_427|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
p270/p270_224|Did he trip?
p270/p270_446|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p270/p270_274|Or was it?
p270/p270_075|My immune system had been depleted.
p270/p270_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p270/p270_039|This represents a tough game for us.
p270/p270_424|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p270/p270_380|How are you, sir?
p270/p270_394|It runs until the beginning of June.
p270/p270_281|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p270/p270_112|This is a step backwards.
p270/p270_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p270/p270_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p270/p270_325|People can really get themselves in a mess.
p270/p270_453|They were good years for him.
p270/p270_273|Who was she?
p270/p270_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p270/p270_032|We have to find a way to put that right.
p270/p270_268|He took over our lives.
p270/p270_140|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p270/p270_211|I am very realistic about these things.
p270/p270_173|Nobody did in those days.
p270/p270_461|We are now up against it.
p270/p270_049|My fitness was very poor.
p270/p270_060|We have not given up hope.
p270/p270_125|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p270/p270_208|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p270/p270_270|how do you get it back?
p270/p270_288|It was never a free kick.
p270/p270_377|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p270/p270_109|I would be prepared to go anywhere.
p270/p270_383|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p270/p270_240|We were a shambles at the back.
p270/p270_287|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p270/p270_311|The world record is suspicious.
p270/p270_163|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p270/p270_170|It's nice to be involved.
p270/p270_218|From there, they can go anywhere.
p270/p270_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p270/p270_157|My Dad is a hero.
p270/p270_229|I am considered a teenager.
p270/p270_247|It had so much to do with output.
p270/p270_271|What are you not good at?
p270/p270_035|Costs have got to be controlled.
p270/p270_367|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p270/p270_144|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p270/p270_121|It's not a quick fix.
p270/p270_416|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p270/p270_364|The value of the merger is still there.
p270/p270_093|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p270/p270_108|We deserve a significant rise.
p270/p270_265|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p270/p270_439|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p270/p270_348|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p270/p270_129|I was on a roll.
p270/p270_168|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p270/p270_238|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p270/p270_025|He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
p270/p270_100|The following are the principal provisions.
p270/p270_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p270/p270_389|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p270/p270_336|Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
p270/p270_145|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p270/p270_080|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p270/p270_252|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p270/p270_410|We must improve our relations with government.
p270/p270_261|You're not getting any goodwill.
p270/p270_397|It has happened for generations.
p270/p270_040|The boy is no longer with us.
p270/p270_214|There can be no compromise on that demand.
p270/p270_205|We believe a third party was involved.
p270/p270_251|I might get an injury very easily.
p270/p270_459|We are over the moon.
p270/p270_388|Last season was very hard for me.
p270/p270_139|Italy was just behind the US.
p270/p270_206|The early physical reports were clear.
p270/p270_354|There is a good example in this city.
p270/p270_171|That would open the gates of hell.
p270/p270_059|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p270/p270_031|Drugs are a serious problem.
p270/p270_409|Colour was at the core of his life.
p270/p270_210|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
p270/p270_390|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p270/p270_175|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
p270/p270_279|There's not much money in cycling.
p270/p270_069|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p270/p270_177|His team management was protective.
p270/p270_299|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p270/p270_215|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p270/p270_134|So what happens next?
p270/p270_164|The woman was his wife.
p270/p270_095|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p270/p270_055|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p270/p270_033|That is the face of fear.
p270/p270_185|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p270/p270_160|How independent is that?
p270/p270_292|You have to expect this type of thing.
p270/p270_434|The British government does not want to know.
p270/p270_104|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p270/p270_162|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p270/p270_079|I first met him last summer.
p270/p270_246|And he goes with it.
p270/p270_307|His day had started much like any other Sunday.
p270/p270_052|Is it worth it?
p270/p270_092|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p270/p270_323|What do we want to do that for?
p270/p270_207|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p270/p270_304|It would be great to win the title again.
p270/p270_431|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p270/p270_305|It could well be military.
p270/p270_166|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p270/p270_263|No production contract is yet in sight.
p270/p270_437|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p270/p270_280|None of this work is guaranteed.
p270/p270_347|Are you from the rugby?
p270/p270_286|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p270/p270_365|Nobody else was with me.
p270/p270_127|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p270/p270_030|He has the courage of the unaware.
p270/p270_236|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p270/p270_333|It is far too early.
p270/p270_406|It's too close to call.
p270/p270_285|It left me with a sadness.
p270/p270_217|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p270/p270_114|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p270/p270_226|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p270/p270_266|We accept the new rules.
p270/p270_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p270/p270_430|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p270/p270_154|The transaction is not feasible.
p270/p270_350|This statement has never been withdrawn.
p270/p270_403|There's still no-one like him.
p270/p270_117|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p270/p270_458|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p270/p270_356|He was at school in Devon.
p270/p270_415|Shelter also supports the reform.
p270/p270_359|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p270/p270_324|Does the name matter?
p270/p270_179|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p270/p270_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p270/p270_195|We represent a wide range of society.
p270/p270_321|Was it the wife?
p270/p270_083|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p270/p270_237|That was a real challenge.
p270/p270_216|It would appear to be a good time to invest.
p270/p270_078|I've had it for the exams.
p270/p270_260|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p270/p270_107|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p270/p270_284|I understand the security issue.
p270/p270_283|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p270/p270_404|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p270/p270_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p270/p270_426|It needs to be volatile.
p270/p270_408|Of course, it is nonsense.
p270/p270_028|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p270/p270_099|That time is not now, however.
p270/p270_449|The budget was too low for that.
p270/p270_155|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p270/p270_372|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p270/p270_316|It is a road of death.
p270/p270_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p270/p270_190|They need to look after themselves.
p270/p270_066|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p270/p270_232|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
p270/p270_257|I was just getting over the time difference.
p270/p270_194|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p270/p270_178|The jury is still out.
p270/p270_344|So, did she meet him?
p270/p270_118|You were made to feel so welcome.
p270/p270_302|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p270/p270_221|What was the matter for concern?
p270/p270_191|Miller was every bit as happy.
p270/p270_250|The irony was not lost.
p270/p270_432|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p270/p270_122|That admission is not surprising.
p270/p270_294|It's hard to see it.
p270/p270_379|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p270/p270_128|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p270/p270_278|He could see no other bidder.
p270/p270_222|Do I think about them often?
p270/p270_378|She said they would appeal.
p270/p270_243|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p270/p270_230|There's a chance they might come down.
p270/p270_071|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p270/p270_087|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p270/p270_133|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p270/p270_376|He must have seen the movie.
p270/p270_309|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p270/p270_413|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p270/p270_142|There was an element of frustration.
p270/p270_234|People should make their own decisions.
p270/p270_204|They have the cash and the fire power.
p270/p270_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p270/p270_387|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p270/p270_363|An alternative must be offered.
p270/p270_036|He really is a lovely man.
p270/p270_301|The rescue package is public money.
p270/p270_414|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p270/p270_051|What do they want us to do?
p270/p270_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p270/p270_374|They knew that I wanted to do something.
p270/p270_371|You need a licence to run a pub.
p270/p270_295|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p270/p270_135|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p270/p270_438|It would be very dangerous.
p270/p270_351|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p270/p270_153|They have not been named.
p270/p270_332|He will go a long way.
p270/p270_192|You know the sort of thing.
p270/p270_293|There's always the next century.
p270/p270_077|It makes for an interesting conference.
p270/p270_158|Do you think we are a top nation?
p270/p270_306|Selection is not in my hands at all.
p270/p270_156|We will turn the corner.
p270/p270_338|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p270/p270_455|This is the stuff of live music.
p270/p270_330|This isn't the end of story.
p270/p270_297|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p270/p270_454|Let that be their memorial.
p270/p270_085|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p270/p270_447|It was to be inclusive.
p270/p270_342|They were impressive against France.
p270/p270_233|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p270/p270_436|I didn't get to keep it.
p270/p270_041|Among them are many criminals.
p270/p270_361|We have very limited capacity.
p270/p270_298|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p270/p270_368|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p270/p270_253|Everything depends on the weather.
p270/p270_346|And does it?
p270/p270_106|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p270/p270_276|These figures are truly terrible.
p270/p270_097|But the battle has only just begun.
p270/p270_300|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p270/p270_244|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p270/p270_184|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p270/p270_343|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p270/p270_340|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p270/p270_402|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p270/p270_420|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p270/p270_289|The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
p270/p270_199|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p270/p270_401|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p270/p270_034|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p270/p270_053|Does it matter?
p270/p270_385|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p270/p270_303|The effect was almost magical.
p270/p270_193|They were seriously after him.
p270/p270_423|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p270/p270_136|But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
p270/p270_358|My view has now completely changed.
p270/p270_082|Potions said he would drive.
p270/p270_329|It is a court case.
p270/p270_422|Such an attack is bizarre.
p270/p270_219|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p270/p270_187|They receive a high profile in the media.
p270/p270_421|My aim is a top six finish.
p270/p270_027|Smoking is also very important.
p270/p270_456|We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
p270/p270_242|They are the innocent victims.
p270/p270_061|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p270/p270_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p270/p270_450|Our legal advice is clear.
p270/p270_451|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p270/p270_264|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p270/p270_137|The first half was depressing.
p270/p270_417|That was a touch of class.
p270/p270_328|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p270/p270_161|What form did that take?
p270/p270_150|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p270/p270_255|This championship is different from the other majors.
p270/p270_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p270/p270_275|And they were being paid?
p270/p270_239|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p270/p270_228|They are difficult awards to decide.
p270/p270_418|People will see this over time.
p270/p270_037|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p270/p270_042|Merger would be entirely logical.
p240/p240_069|It should be devolved.
p240/p240_315|It is no surprise.
p240/p240_043|President Bush is at war.
p240/p240_363|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p240/p240_030|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p240/p240_302|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p240/p240_082|What has changed?
p240/p240_378|It's been hard.
p240/p240_364|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p240/p240_211|We'll have to work hard today.
p240/p240_085|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p240/p240_073|I was as strong as a horse.
p240/p240_380|Safety was also an issue.
p240/p240_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p240/p240_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p240/p240_181|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p240/p240_311|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p240/p240_095|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p240/p240_075|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p240/p240_246|It is hard won.
p240/p240_143|She died at her home.
p240/p240_190|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p240/p240_224|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p240/p240_041|It was the eighties.
p240/p240_107|It's in his blood.
p240/p240_320|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p240/p240_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p240/p240_042|Indeed, he does.
p240/p240_185|We want to help them through it.
p240/p240_235|And thought we would get away with it.
p240/p240_161|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p240/p240_326|It is out there.
p240/p240_103|They will want to perform well.
p240/p240_223|That has been the easy part.
p240/p240_156|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p240/p240_135|Government will intervene.
p240/p240_341|Who was the mystery MP?
p240/p240_115|I'm delighted about that.
p240/p240_366|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p240/p240_322|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p240/p240_144|I am just trying to do my job.
p240/p240_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p240/p240_348|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p240/p240_343|It is a sign of hope.
p240/p240_077|Is there a new way forward?
p240/p240_259|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p240/p240_261|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p240/p240_346|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p240/p240_166|We have a budget in March.
p240/p240_237|It is not the message alone.
p240/p240_147|They did very well.
p240/p240_317|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p240/p240_149|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p240/p240_055|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p240/p240_092|She told The Herald.
p240/p240_187|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p240/p240_352|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p240/p240_058|However the drama was still not at an end.
p240/p240_066|They are real.
p240/p240_086|Someone who cares
p240/p240_068|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p240/p240_173|The hotel was now for sale.
p240/p240_212|She should not be blamed.
p240/p240_374|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p240/p240_001|Please call Stella.
p240/p240_097|He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
p240/p240_071|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p240/p240_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p240/p240_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p240/p240_207|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p240/p240_093|We could not get any possession.
p240/p240_031|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p240/p240_148|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p240/p240_157|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p240/p240_045|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p240/p240_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p240/p240_134|It is also well received.
p240/p240_365|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p240/p240_362|That is a break with tradition.
p240/p240_305|There was no hint of scandal.
p240/p240_064|Art is extra.
p240/p240_250|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p240/p240_303|He said she was mad.
p240/p240_059|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p240/p240_228|It is a gamble.
p240/p240_087|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p240/p240_203|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p240/p240_106|Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
p240/p240_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p240/p240_110|I came to complete.
p240/p240_247|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p240/p240_060|That's the truth.
p240/p240_318|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p240/p240_150|It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
p240/p240_232|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p240/p240_057|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p240/p240_062|I've had six days of rehearsal.
p240/p240_330|That's the law of the land.
p240/p240_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p240/p240_131|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p240/p240_047|It is so sad.
p240/p240_306|The home was now under new management.
p240/p240_193|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p240/p240_271|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p240/p240_332|I am so upset.
p240/p240_340|I've not thought about it.
p240/p240_169|They will do their own thing.
p240/p240_154|I was in daily contact.
p240/p240_197|It wasn't to be.
p240/p240_076|She died in hospital two hours later.
p240/p240_018|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p240/p240_248|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p240/p240_074|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p240/p240_049|This represents a tough game for us.
p240/p240_274|He was also married with two children.
p240/p240_286|If not, he should go home.
p240/p240_292|He will address the nation this evening.
p240/p240_029|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p240/p240_253|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p240/p240_358|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p240/p240_096|They were outside the circle.
p240/p240_216|His third goal was superb.
p240/p240_175|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p240/p240_146|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p240/p240_176|They know no other way.
p240/p240_217|I was so nervous.
p240/p240_056|He had no enemies.
p240/p240_338|He was then replaced by Ross.
p240/p240_179|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p240/p240_194|It is a farce.
p240/p240_304|I was the sheep.
p240/p240_288|His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
p240/p240_039|They're just different.
p240/p240_129|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p240/p240_334|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p240/p240_051|It's a blessing.
p240/p240_367|As, indeed, they would be.
p240/p240_122|There were no grounds for his action.
p240/p240_329|We do the same.
p240/p240_371|That would help.
p240/p240_262|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p240/p240_099|I see no need for change.
p240/p240_221|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p240/p240_294|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p240/p240_038|It has failed.
p240/p240_265|It is also very valuable.
p240/p240_325|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p240/p240_084|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p240/p240_270|It looks as though he will be right.
p240/p240_152|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p240/p240_337|It could have gone either way.
p240/p240_200|But we are not immune to the problem.
p240/p240_355|This is a friendly match?
p240/p240_335|The police have to act to help them.
p240/p240_183|Miller was every bit as happy.
p240/p240_263|I was happily surprised.
p240/p240_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p240/p240_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p240/p240_112|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p240/p240_354|The composer will conduct.
p240/p240_357|They should take their mobile phones.
p240/p240_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p240/p240_210|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p240/p240_198|There was no option.
p240/p240_199|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p240/p240_307|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p240/p240_119|She really suffered for her art.
p240/p240_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p240/p240_101|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p240/p240_359|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p240/p240_128|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p240/p240_349|He has to learn.
p240/p240_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p240/p240_256|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p240/p240_028|Is this accurate?
p240/p240_206|It's all about money, money, money.
p240/p240_088|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p240/p240_279|It's a way of life.
p240/p240_080|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p240/p240_159|These days are long gone.
p240/p240_108|It's a shame.
p240/p240_242|He was good, but not that good.
p240/p240_118|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p240/p240_136|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p240/p240_114|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p240/p240_353|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p240/p240_142|Who would be right?
p240/p240_163|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p240/p240_174|I drove the ball well.
p240/p240_209|We have an election in eight days.
p240/p240_116|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p240/p240_165|Tell it like it was?
p240/p240_264|They must play for each other.
p240/p240_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p240/p240_373|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p240/p240_293|It was a virus.
p240/p240_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p240/p240_277|Access has been a nightmare.
p240/p240_241|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p240/p240_139|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p240/p240_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p240/p240_065|Scotland had great assets.
p240/p240_258|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p240/p240_214|It had all been arranged.
p240/p240_078|I've got the shirt.
p240/p240_276|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p240/p240_033|This is the window.
p240/p240_372|A deadline is still essential.
p240/p240_053|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p240/p240_342|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p240/p240_208|It's a mixture of everything.
p240/p240_339|I saw some good things.
p240/p240_289|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p240/p240_266|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p240/p240_177|There is no point in looking any further.
p240/p240_098|It was a good performance.
p240/p240_220|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p240/p240_336|We agreed to disagree.
p240/p240_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p240/p240_121|You can spend money on housing.
p240/p240_072|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p240/p240_117|I joined a group.
p240/p240_061|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p240/p240_054|He is too weak to move.
p240/p240_125|I was furious.
p240/p240_323|Henman has been warned.
p240/p240_186|They really did a great job.
p240/p240_178|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p240/p240_120|It is a delight on every level.
p240/p240_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p240/p240_376|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p240/p240_140|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p240/p240_040|It's a real threat.
p240/p240_196|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p240/p240_219|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p240/p240_231|They are the innocent victims.
p240/p240_299|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p240/p240_182|They need to look after themselves.
p240/p240_226|What was the main difference?
p240/p240_278|It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
p240/p240_133|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p240/p240_180|They will run a mile.
p240/p240_238|It's quite a line-up!
p240/p240_105|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p240/p240_229|At the time, he was a living legend.
p240/p240_347|It is so unfair.
p240/p240_272|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p240/p240_233|The body follows the mind.
p240/p240_218|Work has started.
p240/p240_324|Craig is a major concern for us.
p240/p240_284|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p240/p240_245|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p240/p240_243|We were extremely poor.
p240/p240_239|It's very safe.
p240/p240_230|It's so special.
p240/p240_360|He had played well in that central role.
p240/p240_063|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p240/p240_249|I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
p240/p240_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p240/p240_215|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p240/p240_361|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p240/p240_345|Three years ago he would have been.
p240/p240_267|Blood samples were taken.
p240/p240_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p240/p240_189|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p240/p240_254|I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
p240/p240_171|It's quite a routine.
p240/p240_291|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p240/p240_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p240/p240_137|He was in a great deal of pain.
p240/p240_113|This film will be totally awesome.
p240/p240_280|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p240/p240_328|They had a confession.
p240/p240_290|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p240/p240_227|I am immensely sad.
p240/p240_375|We are looking for perfection.
p240/p240_035|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p240/p240_327|Referees are easy targets.
p240/p240_141|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p240/p240_079|Today she has been released.
p240/p240_052|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p240/p240_281|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p240/p240_257|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p240/p240_344|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p240/p240_308|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p240/p240_081|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p240/p240_275|And Michael was just great.
p240/p240_282|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p240/p240_312|The plot is minimal.
p240/p240_123|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p240/p240_094|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p240/p240_377|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p240/p240_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p240/p240_236|Jobs could go.
p240/p240_046|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p240/p240_034|People love to see this stuff.
p240/p240_044|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p240/p240_283|People have no choice.
p240/p240_167|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p240/p240_268|There is no link.
p240/p240_331|Donald was his friend.
p240/p240_255|A friendship that will endure.
p240/p240_132|It was the same at Twickenham.
p240/p240_124|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p240/p240_091|Today I couldn't run on it.
p240/p240_379|It's now down in black and white.
p240/p240_032|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p240/p240_314|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p240/p240_213|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p240/p240_130|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p240/p240_202|Who will pay for this?
p240/p240_269|This is a question of Islam.
p240/p240_191|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p240/p240_104|That all hope is never lost.
p240/p240_155|My Dad is a hero.
p240/p240_351|Look at the witnesses.
p240/p240_244|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p240/p240_192|People will ask about us.
p240/p240_240|But it's a subtle process.
p240/p240_321|We are a peaceful people.
p240/p240_160|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p240/p240_310|We do not expect any surplus.
p240/p240_036|It is marvellous.
p240/p240_295|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p240/p240_260|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p240/p240_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p240/p240_204|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p240/p240_273|Have a look at our accounts.
p240/p240_109|It had been played at festivals.
p240/p240_319|They were fantastic.
p240/p240_297|Who did the recruiting?
p240/p240_138|We want to keep the pound.
p240/p240_048|That period was a struggle.
p240/p240_298|He was obviously very genuine.
p240/p240_201|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p240/p240_026|But it failed.
p240/p240_195|I am totally surprised.
p240/p240_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p240/p240_309|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p240/p240_316|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p240/p240_234|However, no further action was taken by police.
p240/p240_126|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p240/p240_127|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p240/p240_301|A new school will be built.
p240/p240_151|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p240/p240_090|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p240/p240_225|But it will be sorted out this week.
p240/p240_100|We have every respect for Michelle.
p240/p240_251|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p240/p240_300|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p240/p240_158|Was this element always there?
p240/p240_370|Hartley should know.
p240/p240_368|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p240/p240_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p240/p240_333|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p240/p240_067|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p240/p240_145|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p240/p240_252|He got the same story.
p240/p240_172|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p240/p240_111|It's a question of perception.
p240/p240_089|They lived for their children.
p240/p240_170|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p240/p240_083|He is in the queue.
p240/p240_153|Mr Blair had done well.
p240/p240_313|And he goes with it.
p240/p240_162|I was in the train station overnight.
p240/p240_102|He takes the job.
p240/p240_070|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p240/p240_184|What has caused the demise of singing?
p240/p240_050|Who can say?
p240/p240_164|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p240/p240_296|It's like a high school play.
p240/p240_285|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p240/p240_369|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p240/p240_188|It is tough, but possible.
p240/p240_222|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p240/p240_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p281/p281_366|There will be no final dividend.
p281/p281_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p281/p281_160|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p281/p281_098|We live by the rule of law.
p281/p281_243|This is the year of the Tiger.
p281/p281_068|I have proved that in the past.
p281/p281_407|It was the same expression of joy.
p281/p281_347|It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
p281/p281_453|We're all paying for it.
p281/p281_164|I have got a wife to feed.
p281/p281_114|His is a success story by any standard.
p281/p281_209|We believe a third party was involved.
p281/p281_450|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p281/p281_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p281/p281_429|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p281/p281_027|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p281/p281_278|For him then it's a labour of love.
p281/p281_101|The following are the principal provisions.
p281/p281_274|He took over our lives.
p281/p281_185|The referee had a good game.
p281/p281_104|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p281/p281_390|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p281/p281_206|No details of the talks were given.
p281/p281_266|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p281/p281_418|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p281/p281_215|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p281/p281_061|We will pay their bills.
p281/p281_108|Why do it otherwise?
p281/p281_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p281/p281_162|It is a terrible tragedy.
p281/p281_245|She died in middle age.
p281/p281_060|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p281/p281_299|This is the correct decision.
p281/p281_144|I was caught out a little bit.
p281/p281_383|He has an equity stake in the investment house.
p281/p281_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p281/p281_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p281/p281_106|It was a funny game.
p281/p281_399|It is hard to understand.
p281/p281_234|This will secure the future of our industry.
p281/p281_172|They could not match it.
p281/p281_254|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p281/p281_295|We have to be very, very careful.
p281/p281_434|We might be back next year.
p281/p281_314|We are in the end game.
p281/p281_041|A week is a long time in politics.
p281/p281_189|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p281/p281_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p281/p281_442|It is pretty bad news.
p281/p281_272|He looked like a schoolboy.
p281/p281_182|The hotel was now for sale.
p281/p281_168|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p281/p281_176|You've got to be vigilant.
p281/p281_199|We always felt we could win.
p281/p281_340|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p281/p281_224|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p281/p281_097|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p281/p281_370|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p281/p281_150|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p281/p281_405|It had been on the cards.
p281/p281_310|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p281/p281_307|We need to increase the membership.
p281/p281_260|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p281/p281_270|That could be in place by next year.
p281/p281_345|I have a moral dilemma.
p281/p281_124|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p281/p281_391|I was as strong as a horse.
p281/p281_193|They were seriously after him.
p281/p281_280|It is also very valuable.
p281/p281_365|I got a yellow card.
p281/p281_262|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p281/p281_311|He was at home with his pals.
p281/p281_154|So what is the campaign about?
p281/p281_241|We played them off the pitch.
p281/p281_232|I am considered a teenager.
p281/p281_136|People come from all round the world to see it.
p281/p281_062|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p281/p281_289|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p281/p281_175|One season, they might do well.
p281/p281_214|He had suffered a heart attack.
p281/p281_191|I have accepted the challenge.
p281/p281_195|And this game is all about belief.
p281/p281_076|There could be a lot of confusion.
p281/p281_247|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p281/p281_458|Both promotions come as no surprise.
p281/p281_198|It decided to blame the media.
p281/p281_167|They will do their own thing.
p281/p281_187|Says the Duke of York.
p281/p281_408|There is a solution, she believes.
p281/p281_229|I'm just a regular person.
p281/p281_341|It's just the way I play.
p281/p281_044|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p281/p281_349|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p281/p281_119|They've got to account for it.
p281/p281_040|They want to be entertained.
p281/p281_297|It is a symbolic concert.
p281/p281_090|It was worth a photograph.
p281/p281_142|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p281/p281_441|He deserves a second chance.
p281/p281_351|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p281/p281_057|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p281/p281_384|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p281/p281_055|The Government should be ashamed.
p281/p281_171|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p281/p281_137|We have seen a copy of the report.
p281/p281_081|I first met him last summer.
p281/p281_439|It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p281/p281_377|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p281/p281_321|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p281/p281_306|These figures are truly awful.
p281/p281_240|You could feel the heat.
p281/p281_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p281/p281_216|You have caught a serial killer.
p281/p281_396|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p281/p281_197|That would be my view.
p281/p281_188|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p281/p281_363|They should take their mobile phones.
p281/p281_181|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p281/p281_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p281/p281_099|This is a national crisis.
p281/p281_239|That has been the easy part.
p281/p281_065|Only water is currently allowed.
p281/p281_218|You are a great player.
p281/p281_287|What was the matter for concern?
p281/p281_416|Does it matter?
p281/p281_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p281/p281_086|The error appeared in a warrant.
p281/p281_244|Wilson will tell the truth.
p281/p281_348|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p281/p281_143|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p281/p281_190|He prefers to play for them.
p281/p281_374|It would be quite nice.
p281/p281_196|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p281/p281_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p281/p281_389|It is a simple equation.
p281/p281_078|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p281/p281_048|That was the theory, anyway.
p281/p281_149|It is not normal practice.
p281/p281_039|This film will be totally awesome.
p281/p281_419|After the match, do you?
p281/p281_089|IT is called a killing in the trade.
p281/p281_225|We're very unhappy about it.
p281/p281_107|What do we do?
p281/p281_315|They come to enjoy themselves.
p281/p281_352|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p281/p281_029|It's not going to work out that way.
p281/p281_056|None has ever been found.
p281/p281_121|We have a training class.
p281/p281_115|Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
p281/p281_183|I can't even get into the A team.
p281/p281_268|That would depend on the parole board.
p281/p281_152|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p281/p281_430|Once again, they would be wrong.
p281/p281_219|What do we want to do that for?
p281/p281_045|Among them are many criminals.
p281/p281_387|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p281/p281_447|I was embarrassed by it.
p281/p281_375|There was a thing in front of the camera.
p281/p281_372|It's as wide as a church in here.
p281/p281_186|I am not ready to walk away.
p281/p281_264|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p281/p281_335|The airport was even different.
p281/p281_032|Our fans have been marvellous.
p281/p281_455|She has now been registered as disabled.
p281/p281_339|Do you think we are a top nation?
p281/p281_145|The FBI could become involved.
p281/p281_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p281/p281_432|He will be judged by his actions.
p281/p281_253|The pig industry is on its knees.
p281/p281_344|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p281/p281_118|It is much as it has been described.
p281/p281_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p281/p281_122|Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
p281/p281_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p281/p281_443|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p281/p281_417|How do you take them away?
p281/p281_324|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p281/p281_093|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p281/p281_072|So is that it, then?
p281/p281_116|Such actions are rarely popular.
p281/p281_077|He also received a medal of honour.
p281/p281_378|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p281/p281_251|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p281/p281_083|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p281/p281_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p281/p281_398|He had returned to die.
p281/p281_411|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p281/p281_226|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p281/p281_201|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p281/p281_303|The rescue package is public money.
p281/p281_179|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p281/p281_213|This is a holy place.
p281/p281_054|That is very hard, alone.
p281/p281_367|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p281/p281_265|I should think so, too.
p281/p281_460|It must never be seen as second class.
p281/p281_249|He has run a hell of a race.
p281/p281_454|This is the stuff of live music.
p281/p281_267|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p281/p281_436|Size is not the issue.
p281/p281_069|He had been a singer.
p281/p281_147|Three hours later, the man was free.
p281/p281_246|We just had a go.
p281/p281_402|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p281/p281_166|The pension levels will remain the same.
p281/p281_153|My Dad is a hero.
p281/p281_058|We should be able to cope.
p281/p281_355|He deserves a top team.
p281/p281_074|The players will be down.
p281/p281_437|It was support as it should be.
p281/p281_357|It should be a great game, though.
p281/p281_134|I never wanted a legal battle.
p281/p281_046|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p281/p281_403|The casualties were not named.
p281/p281_358|I said she was very young.
p281/p281_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p281/p281_028|Smoking is also very important.
p281/p281_223|You have got to look at speed of response.
p281/p281_451|We have the location, which is assured.
p281/p281_184|They know no other way.
p281/p281_292|The target is to break even by Christmas.
p281/p281_210|Tommy is not a problem.
p281/p281_203|Because he was born in England.
p281/p281_035|She failed in her action.
p281/p281_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p281/p281_128|That is far too high.
p281/p281_294|They seem to get away with it.
p281/p281_192|You know the sort of thing.
p281/p281_312|The dealer is on notice.
p281/p281_112|The whole thing is the music.
p281/p281_248|It is set in Paris.
p281/p281_392|I had a fortunate war.
p281/p281_409|Yet the data is compelling.
p281/p281_271|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p281/p281_092|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p281/p281_257|She took them for a term.
p281/p281_173|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p281/p281_157|Had I heard?
p281/p281_342|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p281/p281_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p281/p281_300|He added that the business was in good shape.
p281/p281_322|The letters are going out today.
p281/p281_127|Twaddle is a case in point.
p281/p281_135|We will try to find someone.
p281/p281_286|was everything done to save people?
p281/p281_163|Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
p281/p281_111|They are at a very early stage.
p281/p281_343|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p281/p281_410|That was a touch of class.
p281/p281_276|We feel very good about it.
p281/p281_038|It is a financial matter.
p281/p281_425|That's the way it works.
p281/p281_309|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p281/p281_285|And they were being paid?
p281/p281_079|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p281/p281_120|Then again, we could have.
p281/p281_091|We could not get any possession.
p281/p281_330|It's difficult to predict the future.
p281/p281_082|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p281/p281_109|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p281/p281_034|He should emerge as the winner.
p281/p281_426|The professor is in no doubt.
p281/p281_318|That meant the search was unlawful.
p281/p281_298|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p281/p281_421|Footballers have also been targeted.
p281/p281_073|Do I have a favourite?
p281/p281_258|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p281/p281_412|That is a personal matter.
p281/p281_354|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p281/p281_180|It is not either national standards or local control.
p281/p281_379|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p281/p281_208|They have the cash and the fire power.
p281/p281_051|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p281/p281_423|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p281/p281_140|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p281/p281_400|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p281/p281_161|The strong pound also took its toll.
p281/p281_141|It is not just about pay.
p281/p281_368|The major championships will always have a special place.
p281/p281_404|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p281/p281_424|My aim is a top six finish.
p281/p281_359|He had no previous convictions.
p281/p281_102|Movement has to take place.
p281/p281_362|Neither woman has been named.
p281/p281_222|What are you not good at?
p281/p281_132|He wants to win a major.
p281/p281_397|That investment has now been secured.
p281/p281_067|It is a real problem.
p281/p281_202|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p281/p281_329|There is no shortage of farmers.
p281/p281_095|It is a vicious circle.
p281/p281_207|This will be our new beginning.
p281/p281_221|how do you get it back?
p281/p281_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p281/p281_049|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p281/p281_331|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p281/p281_334|However, the groups denied the claims.
p281/p281_087|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p281/p281_231|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p281/p281_448|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p281/p281_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p281/p281_333|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p281/p281_211|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p281/p281_130|There were no serious injuries.
p281/p281_236|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p281/p281_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p281/p281_281|The demand is created by the supply.
p281/p281_080|He is in the queue.
p281/p281_371|There is no deal as yet.
p281/p281_445|We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
p281/p281_085|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p281/p281_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p281/p281_336|There was no time scale.
p281/p281_155|And does it?
p281/p281_302|Scotch beef is badly missed.
p281/p281_316|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p281/p281_284|That view has not altered.
p281/p281_170|It's nice to be nice.
p281/p281_395|Is there a waiting list?
p281/p281_148|We have a clean bill of health.
p281/p281_325|It is all credit to them today.
p281/p281_158|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p281/p281_037|It carried a double message.
p281/p281_394|What are they for?
p281/p281_261|Persuaded to change his mind.
p281/p281_446|But we have built a platform for next season.
p281/p281_385|He has been a success this year.
p281/p281_129|They made such decisions in London.
p281/p281_053|I must take a seat.
p281/p281_174|Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
p281/p281_066|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p281/p281_177|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p281/p281_413|He seems to be used to the attention.
p281/p281_457|The men are very worried.
p281/p281_138|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p281/p281_360|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p281/p281_282|Not many companies can say that these days.
p281/p281_380|I wanted to go out on a high.
p281/p281_440|THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
p281/p281_290|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p281/p281_353|I think this proposal is excellent.
p281/p281_217|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p281/p281_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p281/p281_146|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p281/p281_327|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p281/p281_071|How are you, sir?
p281/p281_323|I can see their argument.
p281/p281_233|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p281/p281_317|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p281/p281_259|You can never tell with the manager.
p281/p281_075|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p281/p281_228|I had relied on him.
p281/p281_117|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p281/p281_452|They were good years for him.
p281/p281_293|You have to expect this type of thing.
p281/p281_291|He was also married with two children.
p281/p281_131|She was also very brave.
p281/p281_255|The minister is the engineer.
p281/p281_105|It's not a lack of confidence.
p281/p281_388|A review is under way.
p281/p281_212|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p281/p281_200|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p281/p281_205|It was a test in itself.
p281/p281_033|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p281/p281_373|The shares are a strong hold.
p281/p281_273|England could only play the other team on the park.
p281/p281_125|She does not want to speak.
p281/p281_030|They've got their own agenda.
p281/p281_431|Together, we can make a difference.
p281/p281_269|The capital costs are modest.
p281/p281_256|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p281/p281_159|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p281/p281_252|The irony was not lost.
p281/p281_304|We are not doing the Today programme.
p281/p281_250|That is still in place.
p281/p281_059|It was a lovely experience.
p281/p281_242|After that nothing could save him.
p281/p281_401|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p281/p281_288|Do I think about them often?
p281/p281_449|She came to the Highland Show.
p281/p281_235|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p281/p281_263|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p281/p281_227|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p281/p281_036|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p281/p281_320|Scotland has shown the way.
p281/p281_113|Or it would have been.
p281/p281_026|They are very clever in their use of words.
p281/p281_415|Is it worth it?
p281/p281_178|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p281/p281_386|In fact, he was great today.
p281/p281_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p281/p281_428|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p281/p281_308|The real issue is personal.
p281/p281_194|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p281/p281_151|The family kept away from me.
p281/p281_031|I'd just like to play.
p281/p281_364|You need a licence to run a pub.
p281/p281_283|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p281/p281_063|The standard is extremely high.
p281/p281_279|We are aiming for early March.
p281/p281_156|Are you from the rugby?
p281/p281_126|Scottish Life was there over one year.
p281/p281_393|Are they free?
p281/p281_103|City sentiment is in his favour.
p281/p281_165|We have a budget in March.
p281/p281_238|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p281/p281_110|That is the only way forward.
p281/p281_319|This may be perfectly innocent.
p281/p281_382|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p281/p281_427|It was a poor performance.
p281/p281_326|The whole family was in shock.
p281/p281_414|We will stand for the nation.
p281/p281_313|The party lasted all night.
p281/p281_338|Did it work?
p281/p281_420|I am delighted for them.
p281/p281_277|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p281/p281_133|First meeting was next week.
p281/p281_296|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p281/p281_332|But the Farmer is bemused.
p281/p281_043|There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
p281/p281_275|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p281/p281_100|Otherwise, the market may come back.
p281/p281_406|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p281/p281_337|Does that put pressure on us?
p281/p281_350|He did a good job.
p281/p281_301|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p281/p281_047|He looks like an Afghan.
p281/p281_139|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p281/p281_328|The actor has met with Mandela.
p281/p281_204|There was no way back for United after that.
p281/p281_169|Our position remains the same.
p281/p281_050|I had come back from London.
p281/p281_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p281/p281_052|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p281/p281_237|It was a crazy day.
p281/p281_356|It is all about having physical evidence.
p281/p281_422|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p281/p281_088|The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
p281/p281_064|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p281/p281_346|It was almost too much.
p281/p281_123|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p281/p281_381|He has seen the past.
p281/p281_220|Does the name matter?
p281/p281_376|The pair are very much in love.
p281/p281_042|I am just going to go for it.
p281/p281_369|She said they would appeal.
p281/p281_305|There should be room for creative dissent.
p281/p281_433|It is an absolute nonsense.
p281/p281_456|We could hardly believe it.
p281/p281_094|The conclusion is the same.
p281/p281_444|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p281/p281_361|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p281/p281_070|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p281/p281_096|But I know the course.
p281/p281_230|It had all been arranged.
p281/p281_459|We are going through the process.
p281/p281_435|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p281/p281_438|I didn't get to keep it.
p281/p281_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p273/p273_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p273/p273_266|There's not much money in cycling.
p273/p273_198|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p273/p273_204|The statement contained no surprises.
p273/p273_398|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p273/p273_434|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p273/p273_098|The following are the principal provisions.
p273/p273_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p273/p273_415|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p273/p273_401|It was a funny game.
p273/p273_055|Let's hope that it does.
p273/p273_268|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p273/p273_296|Do I think about them often?
p273/p273_314|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p273/p273_064|I was as strong as a horse.
p273/p273_397|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p273/p273_194|Little is known about them.
p273/p273_113|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p273/p273_335|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p273/p273_403|It is a large number.
p273/p273_365|That is a crazy situation.
p273/p273_248|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p273/p273_119|My life has changed a lot.
p273/p273_413|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p273/p273_360|Is there a waiting list?
p273/p273_148|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p273/p273_291|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p273/p273_301|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p273/p273_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p273/p273_357|Do you think we are a top nation?
p273/p273_132|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p273/p273_114|We would make a start.
p273/p273_057|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p273/p273_262|I'd never run for them.
p273/p273_222|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p273/p273_123|It feels like a privilege.
p273/p273_031|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p273/p273_054|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p273/p273_419|That's been all around Europe with me.
p273/p273_161|I did not have a bet on myself.
p273/p273_410|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p273/p273_216|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p273/p273_339|It's wonderful to have won.
p273/p273_241|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p273/p273_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p273/p273_430|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p273/p273_175|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p273/p273_306|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p273/p273_172|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p273/p273_063|The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
p273/p273_417|There is a solution, she believes.
p273/p273_381|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
p273/p273_319|The letters are going out today.
p273/p273_396|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p273/p273_050|How are you, sir?
p273/p273_341|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p273/p273_247|Who was she?
p273/p273_313|The pound has also suffered.
p273/p273_026|It was as if I had been stabbed.
p273/p273_154|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p273/p273_109|He thought she was amazing.
p273/p273_235|He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
p273/p273_118|That is far too high.
p273/p273_286|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p273/p273_345|There was a definite prejudice.
p273/p273_120|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p273/p273_202|I'm just a regular person.
p273/p273_137|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p273/p273_199|His injury was completely random.
p273/p273_362|But BA said the prediction was premature.
p273/p273_201|From there, they can go anywhere.
p273/p273_145|And does it?
p273/p273_331|The airport was even different.
p273/p273_325|It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p273/p273_298|The rescue package is public money.
p273/p273_275|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p273/p273_355|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p273/p273_426|No date has been fixed for his return.
p273/p273_316|Scotland has shown the way.
p273/p273_326|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p273/p273_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p273/p273_107|There's still plenty of time left.
p273/p273_264|This will look at consumer attitudes.
p273/p273_158|One season, they might do well.
p273/p273_323|The woman is basically off her head.
p273/p273_369|The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed.
p273/p273_068|The creditors have lost a lot.
p273/p273_180|What happened in that game?
p273/p273_219|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p273/p273_274|It was an easy decision to come here.
p273/p273_352|My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
p273/p273_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p273/p273_368|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p273/p273_377|In due course the deal was done.
p273/p273_257|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p273/p273_088|It was clear on Thursday.
p273/p273_160|Phase one was a shambles.
p273/p273_035|Among them are many criminals.
p273/p273_116|This is a frightening development.
p273/p273_342|I'd like to take the plunge.
p273/p273_233|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p273/p273_284|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p273/p273_309|I was brought up in a mining background.
p273/p273_110|I came here this week to work.
p273/p273_391|Is it worth it?
p273/p273_253|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p273/p273_285|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p273/p273_079|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p273/p273_218|You could feel the heat.
p273/p273_252|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p273/p273_195|I won't make an official complaint.
p273/p273_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p273/p273_130|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p273/p273_034|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p273/p273_276|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p273/p273_349|He can handle it without any problem.
p273/p273_206|It will affect their work.
p273/p273_105|The pressure is on them.
p273/p273_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p273/p273_082|Potions said he would drive.
p273/p273_103|We deserve a significant rise.
p273/p273_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p273/p273_263|Her body has never been found.
p273/p273_351|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p273/p273_422|My aim is a top six finish.
p273/p273_056|We have to keep our clients.
p273/p273_027|Because we do not need it.
p273/p273_416|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p273/p273_384|It runs until the beginning of June.
p273/p273_125|I am totally devoted to this job.
p273/p273_421|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p273/p273_371|The major championships will always have a special place.
p273/p273_364|They have broken that promise.
p273/p273_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p273/p273_164|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p273/p273_424|Such an attack is bizarre.
p273/p273_308|The world record is suspicious.
p273/p273_162|It is also very valuable.
p273/p273_091|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p273/p273_337|Whether this return was too soon.
p273/p273_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p273/p273_176|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p273/p273_400|The results will take second place.
p273/p273_412|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p273/p273_062|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p273/p273_432|It is not a standing army.
p273/p273_409|Russell is delighted with them.
p273/p273_143|So, did she meet him?
p273/p273_058|We will pay their bills.
p273/p273_086|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p273/p273_237|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p273/p273_074|This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
p273/p273_376|It was like a weekly wage.
p273/p273_226|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p273/p273_269|Any error is severely punished.
p273/p273_307|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p273/p273_032|It carries a double message.
p273/p273_375|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p273/p273_390|Rugby is a hard game.
p273/p273_334|Nobody said it was required.
p273/p273_065|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p273/p273_278|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p273/p273_167|Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
p273/p273_140|Today is not a victory.
p273/p273_273|Truth is the child of time.
p273/p273_207|I am considered a teenager.
p273/p273_163|For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
p273/p273_152|It's never great to finish second.
p273/p273_387|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p273/p273_393|How do you take them away?
p273/p273_272|It was a horrible moment.
p273/p273_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p273/p273_405|I've had a wonderful career.
p273/p273_142|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p273/p273_052|Do I have a favourite?
p273/p273_101|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p273/p273_104|Got to win today, though.
p273/p273_436|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p273/p273_236|My future is in the marathon.
p273/p273_336|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p273/p273_044|My fitness was very poor.
p273/p273_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p273/p273_224|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p273/p273_184|What do we want to do that for?
p273/p273_028|It is about control of our economy.
p273/p273_283|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p273/p273_350|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p273/p273_225|He is obviously very dangerous.
p273/p273_310|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p273/p273_232|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p273/p273_045|We have to look beyond the very short term.
p273/p273_402|It's too close to call.
p273/p273_111|Then again, we could have.
p273/p273_170|It was a bit like having children.
p273/p273_182|Was it the wife?
p273/p273_297|Is it in the right place?
p273/p273_149|They should stop the bombing.
p273/p273_243|Does the name matter?
p273/p273_186|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p273/p273_338|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p273/p273_144|So what is the campaign about?
p273/p273_205|His third goal was superb.
p273/p273_072|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p273/p273_414|I would like to continue to develop.
p273/p273_066|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p273/p273_181|Are you going to win?
p273/p273_240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p273/p273_069|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p273/p273_212|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p273/p273_083|Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
p273/p273_085|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p273/p273_179|I came home by ambulance.
p273/p273_388|We operate as a Scottish company.
p273/p273_312|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p273/p273_333|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p273/p273_166|They bought the property four years ago.
p273/p273_354|He had no previous convictions.
p273/p273_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p273/p273_407|But the foundations have been laid.
p273/p273_392|Does it matter?
p273/p273_183|Why change it?
p273/p273_156|I always felt they played for me.
p273/p273_099|Before the game we went for a pint.
p273/p273_084|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p273/p273_328|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p273/p273_147|Had I heard?
p273/p273_327|It is a terrible state of affairs.
p273/p273_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p273/p273_048|I must take a seat.
p273/p273_042|I was inspired by two things.
p273/p273_061|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p273/p273_385|Theatre is not a museum.
p273/p273_053|What do we do?
p273/p273_208|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p273/p273_329|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p273/p273_121|That would open the gates of hell.
p273/p273_059|It was exactly four months away.
p273/p273_040|People want to see me on the screen.
p273/p273_356|I was delighted to accept.
p273/p273_374|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p273/p273_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p273/p273_395|After the match, do you?
p273/p273_141|Why do it otherwise?
p273/p273_200|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p273/p273_076|He has been a success this year.
p273/p273_353|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p273/p273_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p273/p273_431|They are not left wing.
p273/p273_408|There was an element of frustration.
p273/p273_255|It was the climax of the thing.
p273/p273_071|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p273/p273_037|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p273/p273_321|We will listen to any suggestion.
p273/p273_129|I'm so grateful for that.
p273/p273_189|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p273/p273_265|He could see no other bidder.
p273/p273_230|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p273/p273_373|There is no deal as yet.
p273/p273_190|The early physical reports were clear.
p273/p273_429|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p273/p273_217|William Hague delighted his party.
p273/p273_254|No production contract is yet in sight.
p273/p273_378|to have products for their needs.
p273/p273_112|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p273/p273_043|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p273/p273_292|Tony Blair said as little.
p273/p273_093|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p273/p273_094|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p273/p273_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p273/p273_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p273/p273_150|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p273/p273_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p273/p273_227|It had so much to do with the output.
p273/p273_358|How independent is that?
p273/p273_133|The weather forecast isn't good.
p273/p273_080|It's so hard to shift.
p273/p273_213|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p273/p273_188|They have the cash and the fire power.
p273/p273_173|This youngster is so exciting!
p273/p273_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p273/p273_304|The songs are just so good.
p273/p273_245|What are you not good at?
p273/p273_242|You can feel at home in China.
p273/p273_320|He will go a long way.
p273/p273_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p273/p273_108|I didn't think so either.
p273/p273_281|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p273/p273_033|That is the face of fear.
p273/p273_435|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p273/p273_087|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p273/p273_078|We have to offer value for money.
p273/p273_311|Job losses were also announced.
p273/p273_293|And they were being paid?
p273/p273_174|Two years later, she was dead.
p273/p273_196|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p273/p273_051|So is that it, then?
p273/p273_197|It was worth a photograph.
p273/p273_117|Which can happen any time.
p273/p273_271|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p273/p273_135|Behind him was his brother.
p273/p273_159|The jury is still out.
p273/p273_279|This is a great opportunity for us.
p273/p273_228|We have not been approached.
p273/p273_075|No progress has been made.
p273/p273_433|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p273/p273_178|Because he was born in England.
p273/p273_151|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p273/p273_404|She started to put on weight.
p273/p273_089|It was a family tragedy.
p273/p273_067|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p273/p273_363|They should take their mobile phones.
p273/p273_418|That might mean another delay.
p273/p273_155|They could not match it.
p273/p273_386|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p273/p273_289|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p273/p273_092|He was prepared for this.
p273/p273_029|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p273/p273_287|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p273/p273_379|The pair are very much in love.
p273/p273_347|We have very limited capacity.
p273/p273_367|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p273/p273_193|It gave no further details.
p273/p273_106|New Year will be very busy.
p273/p273_294|was everything done to save the people?
p273/p273_394|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p273/p273_169|You know the sort of thing.
p273/p273_153|The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
p273/p273_372|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p273/p273_210|The transaction is not feasible.
p273/p273_095|We intend to change the model.
p273/p273_399|Clark is back on top form.
p273/p273_332|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p273/p273_239|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p273/p273_380|We will win the argument.
p273/p273_138|It would seem a natural progression.
p273/p273_211|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p273/p273_260|He took over our lives.
p273/p273_361|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p273/p273_389|They have not done so this season so far.
p273/p273_187|It was a moment of madness.
p273/p273_249|We have no information on Iraq.
p273/p273_030|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p273/p273_185|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p273/p273_126|We'll have to think about it.
p273/p273_324|Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
p273/p273_096|We should recognise that others have done a good job.
p273/p273_220|I have spoken to the skipper.
p273/p273_115|His job was not advertised.
p273/p273_124|That is the ultimate revenge.
p273/p273_038|He looks like an Afghan.
p273/p273_295|What was the matter for concern?
p273/p273_346|The strong pound also took its toll.
p273/p273_300|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p273/p273_244|how do you get it back?
p273/p273_097|But the battle has only just begun.
p273/p273_256|We accept the new rules.
p273/p273_288|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p273/p273_267|The demand is created by the supply.
p273/p273_191|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p273/p273_073|It makes for an interesting conference.
p273/p273_041|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p273/p273_090|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p273/p273_060|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p273/p273_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p273/p273_427|It was a breathtaking moment.
p273/p273_322|But it is a slow process.
p273/p273_223|They would have to go to the Royal.
p273/p273_131|There's always the next century.
p273/p273_214|He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
p273/p273_343|I have a moral dilemma.
p273/p273_250|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p273/p273_165|Says the Duke of York.
p273/p273_359|Are they free?
p273/p273_261|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p273/p273_229|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p273/p273_318|Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
p273/p273_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p273/p273_282|You have to expect this type of thing.
p273/p273_299|The effect was almost magical.
p273/p273_238|We were well worth the win.
p273/p273_049|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p273/p273_234|The irony was not lost.
p273/p273_192|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p273/p273_425|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p273/p273_270|Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
p273/p273_348|Everything in golf is a balance.
p273/p273_246|I think, therefore I am?
p273/p273_127|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p273/p273_340|He was at school in Devon.
p273/p273_203|It had all been arranged.
p273/p273_382|It benefits the whole family.
p273/p273_277|It was never a free kick.
p273/p273_428|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p273/p273_102|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p273/p273_077|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p273/p273_305|I can hardly believe it.
p273/p273_303|His appeal is instantly understood.
p273/p273_370|The salary changes are long overdue.
p273/p273_290|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p273/p273_171|It shows the strength of the roots.
p273/p273_280|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p273/p273_231|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p273/p273_423|That means that nobody can do it.
p273/p273_070|Even the one she loved.
p273/p273_134|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p273/p273_136|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p273/p273_259|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p273/p273_047|I expect a rapid response.
p273/p273_157|His team management was protective.
p273/p273_420|She's had to suffer for the last six years.
p273/p273_317|You are talking about a matter of life and death.
p273/p273_411|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p273/p273_168|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p273/p273_039|Everything else is a bonus.
p273/p273_330|They will have to cut through the roof.
p273/p273_036|This will save interest charges.
p273/p273_302|Holland won by five wickets.
p273/p273_366|We are really good friends.
p273/p273_251|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p273/p273_081|They lived for their children.
p273/p273_139|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p273/p273_128|The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
p273/p273_100|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p273/p273_383|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p273/p273_046|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p273/p273_406|Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
p273/p273_258|It was a minor incident.
p273/p273_177|Everyone can have their opinion.
p273/p273_221|That was a problem for me.
p273/p273_146|Are you from the rugby?
p273/p273_209|There's a chance they might come down.
p273/p273_344|My view has now completely changed.
p273/p273_122|You are a gambling man.
p268/p268_090|I am glad I wasn't in it.
p268/p268_193|In addition, margins have been maintained.
p268/p268_121|Or so the story goes.
p268/p268_234|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p268/p268_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p268/p268_176|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p268/p268_350|I am considered a teenager.
p268/p268_074|I am relishing the challenge.
p268/p268_399|It seems to have worked.
p268/p268_114|Well, he is an artist.
p268/p268_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p268/p268_382|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p268/p268_359|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p268/p268_033|Further management changes are planned.
p268/p268_123|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p268/p268_358|We played them off the pitch.
p268/p268_348|Have I really come to this?
p268/p268_245|There was no basis for their arrest.
p268/p268_277|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p268/p268_316|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p268/p268_264|The planning appears to have paid off.
p268/p268_119|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p268/p268_170|I can see it now.
p268/p268_126|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p268/p268_379|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p268/p268_091|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p268/p268_269|They could not match it.
p268/p268_070|The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
p268/p268_411|The capital costs are modest.
p268/p268_192|This is a frightening development.
p268/p268_118|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p268/p268_106|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p268/p268_197|You've got to be vigilant.
p268/p268_213|I enjoy the creative process.
p268/p268_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p268/p268_055|I knew my contract was up this year.
p268/p268_235|They've got some extremely good players.
p268/p268_204|The refund is fully justified.
p268/p268_085|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p268/p268_357|William Hague delighted his party.
p268/p268_225|So I got a blood test.
p268/p268_249|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p268/p268_030|We must convince the citizens.
p268/p268_143|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p268/p268_044|However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
p268/p268_396|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p268/p268_315|Movie stars are public property.
p268/p268_209|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p268/p268_035|It's as we were yesterday.
p268/p268_228|There's always the next century.
p268/p268_042|What do we do?
p268/p268_258|Allen is strong in every shape and form.
p268/p268_183|The hearing was due to continue today.
p268/p268_337|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p268/p268_326|I won't make an official complaint.
p268/p268_076|But the organisers refused to worry.
p268/p268_001|Please call Stella.
p268/p268_172|Do I think about them often?
p268/p268_239|Did it work?
p268/p268_345|How do you take them away?
p268/p268_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p268/p268_312|Everyone can have their opinion.
p268/p268_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p268/p268_066|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p268/p268_303|I'm interested in interesting work.
p268/p268_124|We shall rely on human beings.
p268/p268_198|They have inherited the human rights abusers.
p268/p268_251|These days are long gone.
p268/p268_406|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p268/p268_072|We deserved the three points.
p268/p268_115|Everything else is a bonus.
p268/p268_361|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p268/p268_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p268/p268_329|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p268/p268_291|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p268/p268_063|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p268/p268_219|We had to add value.
p268/p268_057|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p268/p268_385|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p268/p268_160|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p268/p268_309|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p268/p268_141|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p268/p268_321|It gave me something to focus on.
p268/p268_363|The performance continues to improve.
p268/p268_373|I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
p268/p268_098|Are you from the rugby?
p268/p268_034|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p268/p268_177|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p268/p268_284|Injuries have taken their toll.
p268/p268_288|Are they free?
p268/p268_395|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p268/p268_253|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p268/p268_061|Everything is possible in football.
p268/p268_409|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p268/p268_289|What are they for?
p268/p268_214|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p268/p268_140|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p268/p268_261|The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
p268/p268_147|how do you get it back?
p268/p268_353|Instead, he missed the lot.
p268/p268_236|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p268/p268_208|It would make a lot of sense.
p268/p268_164|And so the cycle continues.
p268/p268_254|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p268/p268_203|There was a fine line to tread.
p268/p268_081|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p268/p268_088|It is time for new ways for the church.
p268/p268_232|Years ago it was really quite simple.
p268/p268_049|The latter option was chosen.
p268/p268_402|There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
p268/p268_256|It's never great to finish second.
p268/p268_310|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p268/p268_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p268/p268_130|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p268/p268_405|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p268/p268_153|It's very dangerous for markets.
p268/p268_327|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p268/p268_390|And it had two seats.
p268/p268_125|McPherson came from United Biscuits.
p268/p268_220|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p268/p268_287|What form did that take?
p268/p268_339|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p268/p268_266|We believe in the medium term.
p268/p268_242|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p268/p268_346|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p268/p268_393|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p268/p268_403|We're looking for unity in the council.
p268/p268_307|I saw them last week.
p268/p268_273|A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
p268/p268_354|Laura is an investment banker.
p268/p268_168|We have reacted well to each other.
p268/p268_062|He looks like an Afghan.
p268/p268_187|My father died in childbirth.
p268/p268_071|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p268/p268_294|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p268/p268_154|That's what happened against Ayr.
p268/p268_276|Clearly, they had other problems.
p268/p268_362|The statement contained no surprises.
p268/p268_330|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p268/p268_265|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p268/p268_391|This is a load of nonsense.
p268/p268_252|I've come here for the jersey.
p268/p268_206|We believe a third party was involved.
p268/p268_158|Before the game we went for a pint.
p268/p268_180|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p268/p268_058|It was just too much for us.
p268/p268_292|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p268/p268_026|He got very close tonight.
p268/p268_165|But the relief was short-lived.
p268/p268_073|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p268/p268_223|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p268/p268_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p268/p268_025|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p268/p268_257|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p268/p268_267|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p268/p268_341|We used to live with dignity in our country.
p268/p268_068|This was a far cry from his election pledges.
p268/p268_356|The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
p268/p268_201|You are a gambling man.
p268/p268_041|Do I have a favourite?
p268/p268_138|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p268/p268_096|So what is the campaign about?
p268/p268_394|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p268/p268_351|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p268/p268_116|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p268/p268_398|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p268/p268_102|You should try to have a laugh.
p268/p268_149|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p268/p268_392|Potions said he would drive.
p268/p268_082|But I had never been in a theatre.
p268/p268_195|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p268/p268_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p268/p268_364|This would include the GM food industry.
p268/p268_340|Twaddle is a case in point.
p268/p268_036|We are opening an inquiry.
p268/p268_221|My players have no idea about football.
p268/p268_298|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p268/p268_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p268/p268_215|The whole thing was just unreal.
p268/p268_237|And they removed a Borderer.
p268/p268_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p268/p268_328|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p268/p268_079|He also had a Scottish grandfather.
p268/p268_212|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p268/p268_218|That group reported just before Christmas.
p268/p268_031|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p268/p268_241|It would seem a natural progression.
p268/p268_325|You are a great player.
p268/p268_144|He was forced to quit.
p268/p268_404|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p268/p268_308|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p268/p268_297|We've had great things in the past.
p268/p268_222|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p268/p268_184|His job was not advertised.
p268/p268_283|But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
p268/p268_133|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p268/p268_302|This youngster is so exciting!
p268/p268_205|McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
p268/p268_410|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p268/p268_268|They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
p268/p268_039|How are you, sir?
p268/p268_238|Does that put pressure on us?
p268/p268_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p268/p268_178|We are happy with the referee.
p268/p268_243|We will turn the corner.
p268/p268_045|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p268/p268_086|He's not getting into any games.
p268/p268_231|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p268/p268_175|There's still plenty time left.
p268/p268_151|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p268/p268_349|Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
p268/p268_229|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p268/p268_355|They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
p268/p268_056|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p268/p268_210|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p268/p268_344|Does it matter?
p268/p268_199|This Patton will also return.
p268/p268_211|Bottling is now the core business.
p268/p268_100|What happened in that game?
p268/p268_274|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p268/p268_246|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p268/p268_132|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p268/p268_224|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p268/p268_380|Those overseas offices were great.
p268/p268_334|Walker plans to return indoors.
p268/p268_388|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p268/p268_247|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
p268/p268_378|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p268/p268_389|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p268/p268_146|Does the name matter?
p268/p268_155|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
p268/p268_322|The result is utterly compelling.
p268/p268_376|My wife and family are the support system.
p268/p268_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p268/p268_027|Smoking is also very important.
p268/p268_150|I was given no instructions by no-one.
p268/p268_120|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p268/p268_046|Something has to give sometime.
p268/p268_107|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p268/p268_152|We're not taking any risks.
p268/p268_101|Are you going to win?
p268/p268_278|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p268/p268_094|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p268/p268_262|You had to go and see him.
p268/p268_374|That remains the unanswered question.
p268/p268_366|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p268/p268_078|We should be able to cope.
p268/p268_401|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p268/p268_387|I have received no explanation.
p268/p268_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p268/p268_050|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p268/p268_037|He works at the airport.
p268/p268_285|Says the Duke of York.
p268/p268_317|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
p268/p268_129|It wasn't possible to relax.
p268/p268_272|I came up through the ranks.
p268/p268_139|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p268/p268_323|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p268/p268_093|Final proposals will be published in February.
p268/p268_227|He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
p268/p268_370|He ended up a headmaster.
p268/p268_300|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p268/p268_194|Lee Westwood has other ideas.
p268/p268_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p268/p268_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p268/p268_029|The first appeared to be successful.
p268/p268_162|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p268/p268_179|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p268/p268_306|It caused a lot of upset.
p268/p268_311|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p268/p268_064|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p268/p268_189|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p268/p268_381|Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
p268/p268_181|Pressure of work is no excuse.
p268/p268_028|Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
p268/p268_040|So is that it, then?
p268/p268_173|Is it in the right place?
p268/p268_190|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p268/p268_324|It was his own decision.
p268/p268_230|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p268/p268_336|The only problem was the greens.
p268/p268_060|They desperately want some stability.
p268/p268_259|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p268/p268_314|It was a lovely sunset.
p268/p268_052|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p268/p268_117|Those people must be accountable.
p268/p268_244|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p268/p268_157|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p268/p268_075|Let's hope that it does.
p268/p268_342|Plans were made to expand.
p268/p268_352|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p268/p268_127|The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
p268/p268_059|Perhaps we should do the same.
p268/p268_304|They will probably come back.
p268/p268_318|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p268/p268_099|Had I heard?
p268/p268_053|The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
p268/p268_400|We have no information on Iraq.
p268/p268_367|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p268/p268_113|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p268/p268_295|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p268/p268_145|What do we want to do that for?
p268/p268_105|Maybe this battle has been.
p268/p268_384|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p268/p268_216|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p268/p268_186|That was just one night.
p268/p268_233|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p268/p268_286|How independent is that?
p268/p268_188|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p268/p268_255|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p268/p268_299|It has been recorded twice.
p268/p268_069|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p268/p268_408|I should think so, too.
p268/p268_250|They should stop the bombing.
p268/p268_282|A winter of discontent awaits.
p268/p268_065|He will need that machine.
p268/p268_080|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p268/p268_137|All the employees are redundant.
p268/p268_174|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p268/p268_110|Instead, another depression came in.
p268/p268_377|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p268/p268_226|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p268/p268_167|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p268/p268_320|And we have the experience.
p268/p268_148|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p268/p268_191|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p268/p268_369|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p268/p268_279|Phase one was a shambles.
p268/p268_217|However, this concern appears to be misguided.
p268/p268_301|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p268/p268_161|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p268/p268_128|Their season has been consigned to history.
p268/p268_383|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p268/p268_338|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p268/p268_111|Even the one she loved.
p268/p268_290|Is there a waiting list?
p268/p268_331|We have an election in eight days.
p268/p268_343|My daughter is an adult.
p268/p268_051|The man became a reporter.
p268/p268_134|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p268/p268_335|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p268/p268_083|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p268/p268_135|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p268/p268_375|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p268/p268_109|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p268/p268_332|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p268/p268_095|So, did she meet him?
p268/p268_103|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p268/p268_142|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p268/p268_038|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p268/p268_032|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p268/p268_386|We were beaten by the better team.
p268/p268_407|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p268/p268_122|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p268/p268_131|But then they scored their fourth.

p268/p268_293|The Royal Highland was no exception.
p268/p268_319|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p268/p268_365|There was an element of frustration.
p268/p268_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p268/p268_200|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p268/p268_108|Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
p268/p268_163|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p268/p268_185|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p268/p268_260|We have a budget in March.
p268/p268_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p268/p268_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p268/p268_347|After the match, do you?
p268/p268_169|There were no plans for a rights issue.
p268/p268_166|They exist in name alone.
p268/p268_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p268/p268_248|This is absolutely not true.
p268/p268_368|Weather should not be a factor.
p268/p268_097|And does it?
p268/p268_089|It was exactly four months away.
p268/p268_171|What was the matter for concern?
p268/p268_270|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p268/p268_067|I would not say that.
p268/p268_397|You can feel at home in China.
p268/p268_333|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p268/p268_372|I have little time for analysts.
p268/p268_305|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p268/p268_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p268/p268_313|I was inspired by two things.
p268/p268_371|He looked at me before replying.
p268/p268_156|The following are the principal provisions.
p268/p268_271|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p268/p268_104|He will be kept informed.
p268/p268_196|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p268/p268_043|Why do it otherwise?
p268/p268_182|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p268/p268_296|They need to be involved.
p268/p268_275|They made such decisions in London.
p268/p268_092|In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
p268/p268_054|Among them are many criminals.
p268/p268_280|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p268/p268_077|We have to keep our clients.
p268/p268_084|Kenny Miller might come through.
p268/p268_087|We will pay their bills.
p268/p268_263|The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
p268/p268_202|It is all to do with the coaching.
p268/p268_048|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p268/p268_047|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p268/p268_207|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p268/p268_112|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p268/p268_240|Do you think we are a top nation?
p255/p255_198|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p255/p255_215|That is an important part of our role.
p255/p255_136|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p255/p255_241|It is mainstream.
p255/p255_085|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p255/p255_338|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p255/p255_123|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p255/p255_042|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.

p255/p255_102|Scotland were beaten again.
p255/p255_272|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p255/p255_025|He has not been named.
p255/p255_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p255/p255_196|They are now divorced.
p255/p255_284|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p255/p255_040|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p255/p255_182|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p255/p255_307|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p255/p255_117|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p255/p255_086|We do not get that impression now.
p255/p255_248|It has been declared.
p255/p255_092|We could not get any possession.
p255/p255_152|It is not just about pay.
p255/p255_222|It's not ideal.
p255/p255_299|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p255/p255_202|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p255/p255_261|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p255/p255_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p255/p255_113|I'm delighted about that.
p255/p255_351|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p255/p255_311|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p255/p255_224|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p255/p255_175|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p255/p255_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p255/p255_218|I had decided to quit the show.
p255/p255_314|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p255/p255_329|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p255/p255_032|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p255/p255_076|What has changed?
p255/p255_269|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p255/p255_034|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p255/p255_240|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p255/p255_276|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p255/p255_249|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p255/p255_089|They've got to account for it.
p255/p255_357|We will be homeless.
p255/p255_205|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p255/p255_046|Life is good.
p255/p255_217|I had relied on him.
p255/p255_372|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p255/p255_379|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p255/p255_239|It's the same as Glasgow.
p255/p255_214|He knows a lot.
p255/p255_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p255/p255_090|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p255/p255_376|Colour was at the core of his life.
p255/p255_360|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p255/p255_158|The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p255/p255_356|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p255/p255_199|However, this idea is never developed.
p255/p255_165|I will tell you.
p255/p255_073|He is now resident in England.
p255/p255_266|He can do everything.
p255/p255_100|That time is not now, however.
p255/p255_184|And I saw the light!
p255/p255_318|I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
p255/p255_172|He is keen to stay in public service.
p255/p255_118|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p255/p255_186|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p255/p255_170|I lost my head.
p255/p255_059|Equity declined to comment.
p255/p255_051|Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
p255/p255_098|I had a ball today.
p255/p255_283|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p255/p255_320|Referees are easy targets.
p255/p255_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p255/p255_319|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p255/p255_235|They are the innocent victims.
p255/p255_096|Get to know him.
p255/p255_271|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
p255/p255_044|I felt really good until Friday.
p255/p255_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p255/p255_328|We agreed to disagree.
p255/p255_053|Because we do not need it.
p255/p255_243|We were awful.
p255/p255_130|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p255/p255_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p255/p255_344|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p255/p255_268|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p255/p255_223|The FBI could become involved.
p255/p255_151|He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
p255/p255_116|Does this mean.
p255/p255_285|This is a national crisis.
p255/p255_155|The weaknesses are few.
p255/p255_101|Oil embargo endorsed.
p255/p255_163|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p255/p255_111|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p255/p255_027|They should be so lucky.
p255/p255_267|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p255/p255_192|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p255/p255_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p255/p255_274|It looks as though he will be right.
p255/p255_368|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p255/p255_332|I'd like to take the plunge.
p255/p255_211|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p255/p255_031|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p255/p255_132|It is also well received.
p255/p255_124|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p255/p255_058|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p255/p255_309|Is there on his hands?
p255/p255_352|He's very explosive.
p255/p255_316|Henman has been warned.
p255/p255_210|It was worth a photograph.
p255/p255_036|We do not expect any surplus.
p255/p255_303|Our task is to complete the picture.
p255/p255_094|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p255/p255_348|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p255/p255_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p255/p255_289|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p255/p255_377|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p255/p255_057|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p255/p255_290|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p255/p255_037|Dancing was her life.
p255/p255_050|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p255/p255_191|There is no point in looking any further.
p255/p255_252|It's only fair.
p255/p255_029|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p255/p255_063|We should have known.
p255/p255_246|It is not the message alone.
p255/p255_125|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p255/p255_038|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p255/p255_068|There could be a way back.
p255/p255_295|Who can predict?
p255/p255_060|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p255/p255_108|He was jailed for a year.
p255/p255_134|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p255/p255_358|It was fit for royalty.
p255/p255_171|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p255/p255_087|It is a lifeline.
p255/p255_110|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p255/p255_327|The police have to act to help them.
p255/p255_084|It's never too late.
p255/p255_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p255/p255_257|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p255/p255_226|His death was a tragic accident.
p255/p255_359|We are looking for perfection.
p255/p255_193|Four policemen were wounded.
p255/p255_122|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p255/p255_323|That's the law of the land.
p255/p255_077|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p255/p255_302|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p255/p255_131|Our intentions are real.
p255/p255_330|It could have gone either way.
p255/p255_148|The idea is simple.
p255/p255_190|The goals were good.
p255/p255_341|Nobody else was with me.
p255/p255_221|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p255/p255_365|Tell it like it was?
p255/p255_374|Not because they want to sing about something.
p255/p255_342|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p255/p255_140|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p255/p255_251|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p255/p255_256|There's the mix.
p255/p255_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p255/p255_343|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p255/p255_301|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p255/p255_220|It's been a good year.
p255/p255_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p255/p255_293|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p255/p255_253|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p255/p255_048|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p255/p255_159|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p255/p255_244|They had no children.
p255/p255_331|It is a time bomb.
p255/p255_065|The end result is precisely the same.
p255/p255_055|My mother is a widow.
p255/p255_145|She died at her home.
p255/p255_367|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p255/p255_146|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p255/p255_074|I've got the shirt.
p255/p255_119|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p255/p255_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p255/p255_173|You are not going in blind.
p255/p255_103|Before the game we went for a pint.
p255/p255_030|Life was like a timetable.
p255/p255_255|His body was never found.
p255/p255_052|It's very odd.
p255/p255_254|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p255/p255_247|It's quite a line-up!
p255/p255_230|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p255/p255_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p255/p255_188|It is the whole package.
p255/p255_306|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p255/p255_078|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p255/p255_035|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p255/p255_216|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p255/p255_133|The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
p255/p255_364|Not so, it seems.
p255/p255_375|He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
p255/p255_141|We have got to get it right.
p255/p255_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p255/p255_043|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p255/p255_185|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p255/p255_142|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p255/p255_335|They haven't got a hope.
p255/p255_278|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p255/p255_315|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p255/p255_033|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p255/p255_150|It would be a last resort.
p255/p255_181|The jury is still out.
p255/p255_312|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p255/p255_079|He is driven.
p255/p255_275|He was popular.
p255/p255_194|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p255/p255_345|This is a friendly match?
p255/p255_061|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p255/p255_227|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p255/p255_137|I saw some terrible things.
p255/p255_080|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p255/p255_355|It was one in the afternoon.
p255/p255_300|Graeme was prepared.
p255/p255_075|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p255/p255_161|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p255/p255_297|A new school will be built.
p255/p255_114|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p255/p255_208|It's just awful.
p255/p255_049|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p255/p255_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p255/p255_099|Two of the team became ill.
p255/p255_234|Our numbers are small.
p255/p255_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p255/p255_139|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p255/p255_326|My view has now completely changed.
p255/p255_277|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p255/p255_062|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p255/p255_144|Who would be right?
p255/p255_346|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p255/p255_362|I have got a wife to feed.
p255/p255_195|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p255/p255_072|It works for us.
p255/p255_197|I cannot say too much about them.
p255/p255_258|I can't get a job.
p255/p255_361|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p255/p255_237|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p255/p255_093|If you could find it.
p255/p255_107|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p255/p255_228|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p255/p255_340|Look at the witnesses.
p255/p255_349|That is a break with tradition.
p255/p255_149|It is like a football team.
p255/p255_273|This is a question of Islam.
p255/p255_147|I was awful.
p255/p255_236|It's like a basketball.
p255/p255_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p255/p255_370|They received a reply from their own managers.
p255/p255_317|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p255/p255_279|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p255/p255_333|It can be halted.
p255/p255_047|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p255/p255_219|His third goal was superb.
p255/p255_001|Please call Stella.
p255/p255_250|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p255/p255_162|And sooner than we may think.
p255/p255_305|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p255/p255_104|Further protests are likely.
p255/p255_207|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p255/p255_138|It's a question of fashion.
p255/p255_045|She looked so young.
p255/p255_091|Until you hit the big games.
p255/p255_231|Mental health is a massive issue.
p255/p255_153|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p255/p255_366|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p255/p255_325|It is a strong case.
p255/p255_097|May not have been at fault?
p255/p255_176|You had to go and see him.
p255/p255_242|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p255/p255_270|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p255/p255_178|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p255/p255_310|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p255/p255_126|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p255/p255_187|Tony had arrived.
p255/p255_083|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p255/p255_213|We'll have to work hard today.
p255/p255_166|Eight months later, he was dead.
p255/p255_071|Ferguson should take note.
p255/p255_287|My body is clearly capable.
p255/p255_378|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p255/p255_339|Today, we begin to answer that question.
p255/p255_281|He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
p255/p255_206|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p255/p255_337|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p255/p255_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p255/p255_201|I am totally surprised.
p255/p255_167|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p255/p255_286|The death toll included five children.
p255/p255_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p255/p255_336|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p255/p255_225|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p255/p255_070|Then followed a bout of flu.
p255/p255_081|We have other options.
p255/p255_209|It's all about money, money, money.
p255/p255_232|We played them off the pitch.
p255/p255_174|They will do their own thing.
p255/p255_054|That's the truth.
p255/p255_169|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p255/p255_157|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p255/p255_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p255/p255_066|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p255/p255_354|It benefits the whole family.
p255/p255_288|So I did.
p255/p255_154|We shall not be moved.
p255/p255_298|I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
p255/p255_105|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p255/p255_280|One knows the feeling.
p255/p255_164|It is so unfair.
p255/p255_363|I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
p255/p255_294|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p255/p255_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p255/p255_282|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p255/p255_321|There was some merit in that.
p255/p255_109|I came to complete.
p255/p255_350|I kept going for her.
p255/p255_324|They will be destroyed.
p255/p255_353|I was in the train station overnight.
p255/p255_177|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p255/p255_189|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p255/p255_313|I never thought it would take this long.
p255/p255_233|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p255/p255_179|His team management was protective.
p255/p255_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p255/p255_041|But it might have done.
p255/p255_200|It is a farce.
p255/p255_115|I joined a group.
p255/p255_259|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p255/p255_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p255/p255_373|It's a long process.
p255/p255_308|It's certainly different.
p255/p255_229|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p255/p255_180|Is Saddam a threat?
p255/p255_304|they fail to engage.
p255/p255_203|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p255/p255_129|If not, a deal could take many months.
p255/p255_292|These figures are truly awful.
p255/p255_128|The role was perfect for Russell.
p255/p255_127|It will be too hot.
p255/p255_106|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p255/p255_260|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p255/p255_143|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p255/p255_168|We have to move forward.
p255/p255_095|It is a delight on every level.
p255/p255_371|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p255/p255_082|We want to know about the policy.
p255/p255_160|Work has started.
p255/p255_121|I can't even get into the A team.
p255/p255_263|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p255/p255_334|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p255/p255_120|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p255/p255_369|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p255/p255_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p255/p255_069|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p255/p255_028|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p255/p255_135|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p255/p255_380|The casualties were not named.
p255/p255_183|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p255/p255_238|At the time, he was a living legend.
p255/p255_322|I came into this world with nothing.
p255/p255_204|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p255/p255_262|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p255/p255_264|I am very angry.
p255/p255_212|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p255/p255_112|Maybe this battle has been.
p255/p255_039|It is a memorial.
p255/p255_088|However, it did not end that way.
p255/p255_156|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p255/p255_347|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p255/p255_265|They must play for each other.
p255/p255_381|I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
p255/p255_245|It is set in Paris.
p302/p302_188|I'm really proud of my young players.
p302/p302_065|It is just part of modern day life.
p302/p302_117|I want to play at the highest level.
p302/p302_290|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p302/p302_124|There is only one caveat.
p302/p302_230|Survival is our aim.
p302/p302_104|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p302/p302_258|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p302/p302_161|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p302/p302_031|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p302/p302_171|There is no date on this document.
p302/p302_158|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p302/p302_111|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p302/p302_308|The list is too long for this piece.
p302/p302_255|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p302/p302_172|And now he tells us.
p302/p302_294|Is something which we just don't do.
p302/p302_120|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p302/p302_196|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p302/p302_222|It was a total surprise.
p302/p302_086|She could easily have been killed.
p302/p302_304|The snipers are also out.
p302/p302_039|All of us do.
p302/p302_059|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p302/p302_029|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p302/p302_183|Smith has not let him down.
p302/p302_134|It has been in place since last July.
p302/p302_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p302/p302_220|Appointed general secretary last September.
p302/p302_154|I know you went back this morning.
p302/p302_248|He should be a great asset.
p302/p302_175|It is time to come into the limelight.
p302/p302_068|YOU thought it was a headache.
p302/p302_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
p302/p302_204|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p302/p302_269|Three years probation is just a joke.
p302/p302_237|I had a sense of deja vu.
p302/p302_041|It could have been just a quick fix.
p302/p302_315|It's like the Russians.
p302/p302_231|There is no reason at all.
p302/p302_129|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p302/p302_240|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p302/p302_234|I'm pleased with the horse.
p302/p302_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p302/p302_182|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p302/p302_265|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p302/p302_187|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p302/p302_146|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p302/p302_150|Debbie Harry was cool.
p302/p302_001|Please call Stella.
p302/p302_159|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p302/p302_186|They have two children.
p302/p302_291|He is a success story by any standard.
p302/p302_257|It didn't take long.
p302/p302_051|There was nobody on the roof.
p302/p302_030|It is a very special city.
p302/p302_089|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p302/p302_106|But the attachment took a lot of growing.
p302/p302_090|The same goes for personnel.
p302/p302_164|But they will not be compelled to join.
p302/p302_036|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p302/p302_054|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p302/p302_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p302/p302_071|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p302/p302_118|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p302/p302_128|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p302/p302_193|Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
p302/p302_262|It's not one for the purists.
p302/p302_162|The red card was okay.
p302/p302_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
p302/p302_292|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p302/p302_044|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p302/p302_076|You do have a way out.
p302/p302_286|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p302/p302_311|It plans to return to this field.
p302/p302_189|People buy everything with cash.
p302/p302_180|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p302/p302_136|Do you think they would be any better?
p302/p302_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p302/p302_077|It is simple, really.
p302/p302_145|It is a very interesting subject.
p302/p302_091|He was a crazy man.
p302/p302_110|I hope they understand that.
p302/p302_107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p302/p302_316|Is that Titanic?
p302/p302_296|I've got a young family.
p302/p302_097|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p302/p302_225|No meaningful response was issued.
p302/p302_140|How much of a cop out is that?
p302/p302_276|We have turned the corner.
p302/p302_190|There was great support all round the route.
p302/p302_191|It's amazing it happened in daytime.
p302/p302_229|It is something that we will put right.
p302/p302_228|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p302/p302_210|I was surprised by his response.
p302/p302_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p302/p302_249|It means they actually control the programme.
p302/p302_163|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p302/p302_034|My game is in pretty good shape.
p302/p302_115|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p302/p302_275|That got me out of jail.
p302/p302_139|The singer's condition was not specified.
p302/p302_040|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p302/p302_101|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p302/p302_121|The trial is set for February.
p302/p302_215|Is this accurate?
p302/p302_084|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p302/p302_143|Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
p302/p302_200|They had not been handcuffed.
p302/p302_005|She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p302/p302_157|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p302/p302_078|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p302/p302_239|They follow him everywhere.
p302/p302_217|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p302/p302_168|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p302/p302_226|It is a form of physical exercise.
p302/p302_033|I've taken to the hills.
p302/p302_206|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p302/p302_169|We must put a marker down.
p302/p302_271|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p302/p302_235|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p302/p302_244|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p302/p302_049|Happily we found it in the library.
p302/p302_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p302/p302_211|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p302/p302_194|Or so we have long assumed.
p302/p302_203|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p302/p302_259|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p302/p302_313|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p302/p302_088|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p302/p302_299|I really don't understand what is happening.
p302/p302_155|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p302/p302_082|PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
p302/p302_131|I heard some of his remarks.
p302/p302_307|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p302/p302_027|Each one has its own system.
p302/p302_037|We used to keep our business rates.
p302/p302_135|The European Court is our only option.
p302/p302_050|I know a lot of people who don't.
p302/p302_252|We could have got three medals.
p302/p302_253|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p302/p302_094|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p302/p302_245|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p302/p302_144|You were the kidnappers.
p302/p302_167|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p302/p302_073|That alibi is now gone.
p302/p302_112|She will also get a pay rise.
p302/p302_173|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p302/p302_232|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p302/p302_046|He could face a jail sentence.
p302/p302_074|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p302/p302_103|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p302/p302_087|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p302/p302_284|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p302/p302_272|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p302/p302_267|It's a matter of huge concern.
p302/p302_062|He said it was the worst possible result.
p302/p302_147|I could feel the blood on my face.
p302/p302_254|We are at a crossroads.
p302/p302_305|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p302/p302_177|His name is Michael Owen.
p302/p302_293|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p302/p302_312|However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p302/p302_241|There was no safety net.
p302/p302_026|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p302/p302_083|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p302/p302_297|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p302/p302_080|You, the British people, are the boss.
p302/p302_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p302/p302_075|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p302/p302_243|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p302/p302_283|Do yourselves a favour.
p302/p302_179|I will have to order its destruction.
p302/p302_070|But it was to no avail.
p302/p302_142|It will be the final push.
p302/p302_181|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p302/p302_045|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p302/p302_238|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p302/p302_227|plays in dark blue.
p302/p302_205|We have chosen for the patients.
p302/p302_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
p302/p302_287|I'd love to be like Peter.
p302/p302_079|I was in jail for five years.
p302/p302_185|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p302/p302_281|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p302/p302_278|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p302/p302_151|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p302/p302_282|I see no need for change.
p302/p302_047|They don't take you to mass graves.
p302/p302_224|And we're not there yet.
p302/p302_035|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p302/p302_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p302/p302_208|Which means it matters.
p302/p302_057|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p302/p302_053|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p302/p302_274|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p302/p302_268|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p302/p302_223|I had enough on.
p302/p302_250|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p302/p302_028|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p302/p302_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p302/p302_098|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p302/p302_105|It separates the men from the boys.
p302/p302_288|They came into collision with Sergio.
p302/p302_093|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p302/p302_042|We are looking for volunteers.
p302/p302_221|They make it look very easy.
p302/p302_270|The outstanding issues are still there.
p302/p302_064|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p302/p302_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p302/p302_263|She said he showed no remorse.
p302/p302_153|I'm afraid to say anything.
p302/p302_247|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p302/p302_137|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p302/p302_114|It is time for a more honest approach.
p302/p302_166|I was doing well at the hustings.
p302/p302_295|We work on the same level.
p302/p302_133|I was just overwhelmed.
p302/p302_096|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p302/p302_108|Two and a half million people have died.
p302/p302_067|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p302/p302_081|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p302/p302_266|It is a time bomb.
p302/p302_279|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p302/p302_138|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p302/p302_280|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p302/p302_201|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p302/p302_123|Do not go into government buildings.
p302/p302_306|We are determined to establish the facts.
p302/p302_216|A judicial review is also being considered.
p302/p302_214|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p302/p302_127|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p302/p302_285|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p302/p302_095|There was an element of jealousy.
p302/p302_102|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p302/p302_058|We must improve our relations with the government.
p302/p302_148|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p302/p302_132|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p302/p302_048|What's it got to do with art?
p302/p302_277|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p302/p302_236|This is a club on the rise.
p302/p302_052|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p302/p302_122|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p302/p302_165|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p302/p302_251|We are not out of touch with politics.
p302/p302_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p302/p302_061|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p302/p302_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p302/p302_116|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p302/p302_174|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p302/p302_126|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p302/p302_184|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p302/p302_289|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p302/p302_119|It ignores the future.
p302/p302_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p302/p302_218|They could go no further forward.
p302/p302_099|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p302/p302_303|My friends were very envious.
p302/p302_212|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p302/p302_199|All the names are familiar to me.
p302/p302_233|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p302/p302_246|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p302/p302_063|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p302/p302_207|Why should we even be asked to share?
p302/p302_209|There is a great potential on this river.
p302/p302_109|Or so it would appear.
p302/p302_100|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p302/p302_301|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p302/p302_213|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p302/p302_038|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p302/p302_149|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p302/p302_261|He also received a medal of honour.
p302/p302_066|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p302/p302_302|I am a wealthy person.
p302/p302_197|It's not just for classical music.
p302/p302_125|We are still getting signals.
p302/p302_192|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p302/p302_056|Henry was strong and talented.
p302/p302_055|The days of empty promises are over.
p302/p302_195|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p302/p302_085|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p302/p302_152|That sort of thing is long gone.
p302/p302_198|This must be kept in total perspective.
p302/p302_170|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p302/p302_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p302/p302_202|I've never been limited on drugs.
p302/p302_092|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p302/p302_160|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p302/p302_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p302/p302_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p302/p302_130|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p302/p302_219|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p302/p302_260|I started on a fire a couple of times.
p302/p302_141|The whole region is in shock.
p302/p302_310|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p302/p302_043|Theatre is not a museum.
p302/p302_069|I hope we can put it behind us.
p302/p302_298|It all seemed so easy.
p302/p302_242|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p302/p302_264|I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p302/p302_314|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p302/p302_156|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p302/p302_025|It does make a big difference.
p302/p302_300|The frustration was showing.
p302/p302_176|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p302/p302_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p302/p302_032|He's not very big, either.
p302/p302_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p302/p302_309|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p302/p302_072|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p302/p302_060|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p351/p351_187|It was better than a soap opera.
p351/p351_202|Ownership was the game.
p351/p351_190|This is a special place for me.
p351/p351_399|Where does it come from?
p351/p351_157|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p351/p351_234|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p351/p351_080|I don't understand it.
p351/p351_083|I just wanted to get off the course.
p351/p351_296|Were they under-age?
p351/p351_156|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
p351/p351_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p351/p351_104|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
p351/p351_107|- Really you will !
p351/p351_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p351/p351_101|In part that reflected the times.
p351/p351_144|But it will be sorted out this week.
p351/p351_170|They will be seen for years to come.
p351/p351_210|If only the problems concerned the players.
p351/p351_033|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p351/p351_135|My whole family is.
p351/p351_250|They seem to turn up for them.
p351/p351_218|The problem is worse in Scotland.
p351/p351_045|You had to go and see him.
p351/p351_125|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p351/p351_394|I am so, so, so lucky.
p351/p351_307|It was all very proper and civilised.
p351/p351_060|They have been very lucky with the ice.
p351/p351_128|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p351/p351_365|I believe she was elected unopposed.
p351/p351_211|But it was money well spent.
p351/p351_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p351/p351_383|He was the architect.
p351/p351_360|It may be his last for a while, too.
p351/p351_374|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p351/p351_047|We know we can defend it.
p351/p351_371|Frustration is not the word.
p351/p351_382|They were just too good for us.
p351/p351_309|Then you see it.
p351/p351_212|That's the most important thing for me.
p351/p351_118|There's nothing new in that argument.
p351/p351_332|He also called in at another farm.
p351/p351_099|They were unable to revive him.
p351/p351_069|The working families tax credit is far better.
p351/p351_306|Who can predict?
p351/p351_133|That was my mistake.
p351/p351_076|His track record is impressive.
p351/p351_174|But is that possible?
p351/p351_419|What's it for, after all?
p351/p351_338|That's just the kind of thing we have.
p351/p351_317|He will be really pleased about this.
p351/p351_376|But what lies ahead?
p351/p351_331|That has not been the case, as we now know.
p351/p351_152|There is nothing they can't do.
p351/p351_305|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p351/p351_273|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
p351/p351_087|Things are meant to be.
p351/p351_334|He will go a long way.
p351/p351_373|The cause is just.
p351/p351_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p351/p351_356|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p351/p351_214|No decision has yet been made.
p351/p351_052|I won't go back.
p351/p351_269|There were moments of humour too.
p351/p351_379|My heart is not so sure.
p351/p351_257|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p351/p351_041|Will we ever play together again?
p351/p351_392|This is the last straw.
p351/p351_116|It's the way we go about it.
p351/p351_322|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p351/p351_079|This youngster is so exciting!
p351/p351_364|Off with their heads.
p351/p351_043|He is keen to stay in public service.
p351/p351_119|This time it was out of the blue.
p351/p351_177|It was really frustrating.
p351/p351_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p351/p351_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p351/p351_344|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p351/p351_035|We have to win every game.
p351/p351_345|It will carry on.
p351/p351_209|It's a very important and beautiful day.
p351/p351_042|What are the barriers?
p351/p351_354|The Government has listened.
p351/p351_159|The whole thing in general is moving on.
p351/p351_094|The matter is under discussion.
p351/p351_405|But is he?
p351/p351_318|He had no access to the database.
p351/p351_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p351/p351_414|This is a successful outcome.
p351/p351_420|We will be pleased to talk to them.
p351/p351_146|Mr Smith was dismissive.
p351/p351_067|We can't go home.
p351/p351_291|He's had a lot of injury problems.
p351/p351_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p351/p351_207|Six years is too long.
p351/p351_357|It's too horrible to think.
p351/p351_089|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p351/p351_398|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p351/p351_062|My players are special.
p351/p351_171|I'm really happy with how things went there.
p351/p351_124|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
p351/p351_389|It's easy to see why.
p351/p351_406|So it's a daily struggle.
p351/p351_051|This isn't a gimmick.
p351/p351_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p351/p351_050|Instead we were shot in the back.
p351/p351_001|Please call Stella.
p351/p351_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p351/p351_308|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p351/p351_230|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p351/p351_093|Only he's not as young as he looks.
p351/p351_095|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p351/p351_415|His first album was a hit.
p351/p351_103|Yes, it was too short a night.
p351/p351_261|That is very important to people.
p351/p351_031|He added, We have the same desire.
p351/p351_411|You need a licence to run a pub.
p351/p351_408|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p351/p351_183|We were extremely poor.
p351/p351_302|I would love to see it back there.
p351/p351_417|The plane was shaking.
p351/p351_198|He invented the language.
p351/p351_253|Now the show is for public consumption.
p351/p351_158|It is the voice of the survivors.
p351/p351_167|He is very confident at the moment.
p351/p351_127|The truth, of course, is very different.
p351/p351_350|It will make a big difference.
p351/p351_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p351/p351_186|We are still paying the price for that.
p351/p351_251|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
p351/p351_049|He met his wife and married in England.
p351/p351_290|We were used to being in control.
p351/p351_233|We've never seen so many.
p351/p351_289|I feel it is very irrational.
p351/p351_065|His handling raises a wider issue.
p351/p351_304|He should have won.
p351/p351_300|My mind was made up.
p351/p351_243|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p351/p351_161|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p351/p351_206|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p351/p351_346|Our season is not over.
p351/p351_413|I am not sure.
p351/p351_117|I will be ridiculed.
p351/p351_068|That just wasn't good enough.
p351/p351_342|I am proud of my team.
p351/p351_303|He then did just that.
p351/p351_097|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p351/p351_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p351/p351_228|I grew up with them.
p351/p351_267|I feel pretty good.
p351/p351_217|He took over our lives.
p351/p351_348|Money is not everything in life.
p351/p351_066|We have got the school holidays on.
p351/p351_204|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p351/p351_149|They will be ready.
p351/p351_132|But, still, it wasn't working.
p351/p351_201|I went away to recover fully.
p351/p351_168|Well, what can you do?
p351/p351_173|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
p351/p351_030|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
p351/p351_312|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p351/p351_353|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p351/p351_329|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p351/p351_153|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
p351/p351_416|The salary changes are long overdue.
p351/p351_072|I feel alive and good today.
p351/p351_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p351/p351_315|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p351/p351_036|They also have good neighbours.
p351/p351_287|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p351/p351_208|They are not a set of options.
p351/p351_213|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p351/p351_395|What is it about this series?
p351/p351_154|If you can work, you should work.
p351/p351_335|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p351/p351_229|It was the train coming.
p351/p351_027|I have not seen the term immediate.
p351/p351_297|You are going to go to jail.
p351/p351_368|The pain is still acute.
p351/p351_075|It was a pretty terrible day.
p351/p351_237|That is important for the club.
p351/p351_194|It is crucial to understand this in context.
p351/p351_200|We need to know more about her.
p351/p351_064|The devil is in the detail.
p351/p351_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p351/p351_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p351/p351_096|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p351/p351_293|It happened again, and again, and again.
p351/p351_136|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
p351/p351_260|I think it was his parents.
p351/p351_221|We just want them home.
p351/p351_284|The rest, of course, is history.
p351/p351_264|No other country has ever won this tournament.
p351/p351_286|That was not the norm.
p351/p351_263|This is a dream come true for me.
p351/p351_109|Who will pay for this?
p351/p351_281|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p351/p351_082|He was rejected because he had retired.
p351/p351_409|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
p351/p351_203|It makes a huge difference.
p351/p351_343|I am a doctor.
p351/p351_108|The driver was unhurt.
p351/p351_100|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p351/p351_326|I played well but missed a few chances.
p351/p351_139|There has been no delay on government orders.
p351/p351_147|It was a discussion paper.
p351/p351_084|She was also very brave.
p351/p351_256|The old manager, he didn't like me.
p351/p351_330|They're just a nonsense.
p351/p351_276|We have been very patient.
p351/p351_372|The police have to act to help them.
p351/p351_070|those who are preparing to give up.
p351/p351_370|It is a very big problem.
p351/p351_311|We don't believe anything anymore.
p351/p351_175|In many ways, that is as important.
p351/p351_320|He also seems to have been around forever.
p351/p351_182|That's the way things are heading.
p351/p351_252|Now we are back on top of Europe.
p351/p351_349|She kept him on a string.
p351/p351_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p351/p351_122|We were not going to take that risk.
p351/p351_150|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p351/p351_162|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p351/p351_259|It was like being in prison.
p351/p351_337|It's so much more fun.
p351/p351_196|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
p351/p351_412|Everything else is second.
p351/p351_063|We are the gateway to justice.
p351/p351_351|There was no basis for their arrest.
p351/p351_328|It's my initial background.
p351/p351_275|This is not a message from ministers.
p351/p351_239|Blood samples were taken.
p351/p351_298|It is a very worrying report.
p351/p351_403|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p351/p351_131|He said it was the worst possible result.
p351/p351_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p351/p351_424|I kept going for her.
p351/p351_180|It would have very little impact on them.
p351/p351_053|There is no signature on this document.
p351/p351_310|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p351/p351_363|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p351/p351_054|We could not compete with Rangers.
p351/p351_145|It's just a fact.
p351/p351_232|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p351/p351_341|But he has strong links to Labour.
p351/p351_164|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p351/p351_166|It feels that the game is off.
p351/p351_179|Many other areas are coming up.
p351/p351_172|He will be greatly missed.
p351/p351_046|What did you learn in school today?
p351/p351_111|You have caught a serial killer.
p351/p351_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p351/p351_092|Four had been brought down.
p351/p351_185|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p351/p351_266|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p351/p351_418|It was visibly on fire.
p351/p351_375|Our message is getting through.
p351/p351_270|He has a wealth of experience.
p351/p351_254|I want to create events.
p351/p351_314|There is good quality.
p351/p351_410|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p351/p351_138|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p351/p351_226|Perhaps it was just as well.
p351/p351_248|Some were close to tears.
p351/p351_165|It is not an escape.
p351/p351_249|It has become a way of life.
p351/p351_090|This is already happening.
p351/p351_400|You find it bizarre?
p351/p351_113|What's the problem?
p351/p351_402|It has proved a double whammy.
p351/p351_352|This latter suggestion is very important.
p351/p351_192|Our policy is clear.
p351/p351_110|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
p351/p351_423|I'm going to take it further.
p351/p351_325|Seven people were already in custody in France.
p351/p351_091|We have a rehearsal.
p351/p351_098|They have played their part.
p351/p351_366|We are not asking for the moon.
p351/p351_048|That is not the case.
p351/p351_140|I think we can overcome it.
p351/p351_294|Does it matter?
p351/p351_151|He is walking free.
p351/p351_039|I have got a wife to feed.
p351/p351_085|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p351/p351_040|We are getting people into work.
p351/p351_115|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
p351/p351_163|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
p351/p351_071|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p351/p351_141|We will be victorious.
p351/p351_235|I am very, very happy.
p351/p351_205|It's not a new device.
p351/p351_245|Haven't been so lucky since.
p351/p351_240|Now he is in charge of this.
p351/p351_339|It's getting to me.
p351/p351_282|We just wish they had done so before.
p351/p351_265|There he goes again.
p351/p351_199|We want to play at the worlds.
p351/p351_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p351/p351_126|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
p351/p351_074|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
p351/p351_044|Who are the democrats?
p351/p351_388|He, too, was not satisfied.
p351/p351_336|I lost a part of me.
p351/p351_032|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
p351/p351_377|She makes me so happy.
p351/p351_316|But these things are happening now.
p351/p351_129|These will take a little time to develop.
p351/p351_123|Last night he became one of the hunted.
p351/p351_285|They chose the latter.
p351/p351_277|I don't take that view.
p351/p351_058|The jury is still out.
p351/p351_026|I don't think they can complain about that.
p351/p351_216|Which is fair enough.
p351/p351_358|It can be frightening.
p351/p351_038|They are not advertised.
p351/p351_037|Both sides will be aware of this.
p351/p351_236|The case was continued.
p351/p351_313|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p351/p351_258|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p351/p351_292|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
p351/p351_155|This was a very tragic accident.
p351/p351_134|We can play better than that.
p351/p351_227|That, though, was then.
p351/p351_102|That is not true.
p351/p351_120|We need to get the right people in.
p351/p351_188|There will be no change in government.
p351/p351_422|They have got off with murder.
p351/p351_299|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p351/p351_224|It may not even be possible.
p351/p351_057|Now it has become a big picture.
p351/p351_086|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p351/p351_384|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p351/p351_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p351/p351_059|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p351/p351_244|The home team also had their moments.
p351/p351_369|This was not the show for me.
p351/p351_219|This is a historic agreement.
p351/p351_255|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p351/p351_137|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p351/p351_160|They might also be parlous.
p351/p351_396|You read it right.
p351/p351_268|It's got to come from me.
p351/p351_390|But it didn't happen.
p351/p351_295|She thought she was going to die.
p351/p351_028|My Dad is a hero.
p351/p351_176|I think we're going to make it.
p351/p351_391|All were believed to be adults.
p351/p351_262|I certainly hope not.
p351/p351_274|They were too hard.
p351/p351_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p351/p351_223|I was happily surprised.
p351/p351_143|It was the crowning point of my career.
p351/p351_056|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p351/p351_387|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
p351/p351_359|He was, but only just.
p351/p351_073|She was married with one son.
p351/p351_148|My neighbours are horrified.
p351/p351_025|It was by the numbers.
p351/p351_272|It happens from time to time.
p351/p351_283|It was a virus.
p351/p351_385|It's a fantastic achievement.
p351/p351_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p351/p351_238|He is doing the right things.
p351/p351_142|The other question is why the scaling down?
p351/p351_333|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
p351/p351_061|We are not the first to be affected.
p351/p351_184|The parties have no contact.
p351/p351_407|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p351/p351_321|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p351/p351_178|Clubs can only do so much.
p351/p351_246|He is under no illusions.
p351/p351_362|What's wrong with that?
p351/p351_034|Teachers have been given the offer.
p351/p351_355|It's only tackling congestion.
p351/p351_121|It is a great shame.
p351/p351_386|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p351/p351_401|I am very excited about this season.
p351/p351_279|My only concern is for my children.
p351/p351_397|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
p351/p351_278|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p351/p351_130|I might come back.
p351/p351_323|Others are expected to do so soon.
p351/p351_169|It is not the message alone.
p351/p351_055|There was mystery back then.
p351/p351_222|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
p351/p351_319|They were not up to the required standard.
p351/p351_404|It should be a great game, though.
p351/p351_271|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p351/p351_106|We have no excuses.
p351/p351_247|It got no better.
p351/p351_378|They promised to fight the plans.
p351/p351_114|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p351/p351_301|It was an ongoing exercise.
p351/p351_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p351/p351_241|They want to play in the World Cup.
p351/p351_242|He was embarrassed about what he did.
p351/p351_220|He had worked there for only two days.
p351/p351_421|A number of people could not speak English.
p351/p351_231|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p351/p351_197|We expect a full house on the night.
p351/p351_081|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p351/p351_381|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p351/p351_029|It is my fault.
p351/p351_380|I am happy for her.
p351/p351_327|Our approach will be different.
p351/p351_347|I am not retiring.
p351/p351_288|It is giving out the wrong message.
p351/p351_215|I have had a lovely summer.
p351/p351_393|The research was my life.
p351/p351_340|So we talked about that for a bit.
p351/p351_324|They were impressive against France.
p351/p351_078|It is tough, but possible.
p351/p351_088|One year later, he finally decided to act.
p351/p351_189|I am just grateful he is alive.
p351/p351_193|This was an hour before the show.
p351/p351_112|It's all about money, money, money.
p351/p351_280|This is welcome news.
p351/p351_367|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p351/p351_195|I now know that from memory.
p351/p351_181|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p351/p351_077|Clearly it is very disturbing.
p351/p351_225|I think it is a scandal.
p351/p351_191|This was a great result for us, a big result.
p300/p300_300|We agreed to disagree.
p300/p300_219|I might get an injury very easily.
p300/p300_391|Form and structure are his music.
p300/p300_377|Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
p300/p300_382|There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
p300/p300_208|We were on top and could've won.
p300/p300_303|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p300/p300_075|She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
p300/p300_114|I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
p300/p300_076|Henman is taking nothing for granted.
p300/p300_372|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p300/p300_289|The fund has three elements.
p300/p300_215|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p300/p300_189|It was located on the remote control.
p300/p300_357|I've only met him three times.
p300/p300_379|They should have some measure of protection.
p300/p300_270|The main thing is that they enjoy it.
p300/p300_168|Four policemen were wounded.
p300/p300_176|It is very difficult to find a buyer.
p300/p300_351|This time, however, there is a new venue.
p300/p300_186|A bit of match fitness is required.
p300/p300_185|I am writing a novel.
p300/p300_058|Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
p300/p300_226|I found a fault and it worked at it.
p300/p300_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p300/p300_202|Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
p300/p300_174|It was a bit like having children.
p300/p300_026|This is not a floating Las Vegas.
p300/p300_326|She is now on the back benches.
p300/p300_175|You cannot eat in the dining room.
p300/p300_110|I am prepared to step down.
p300/p300_244|At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
p300/p300_187|All were paid by the taxpayer.
p300/p300_388|A century on, little has changed.
p300/p300_286|The law will take its course.
p300/p300_397|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p300/p300_164|I do my job.
p300/p300_214|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p300/p300_339|But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
p300/p300_231|We have tried to keep his head up.
p300/p300_293|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p300/p300_279|But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
p300/p300_001|Please call Stella.
p300/p300_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p300/p300_118|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p300/p300_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p300/p300_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p300/p300_072|In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
p300/p300_147|We need a new kind of theatre.
p300/p300_069|Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
p300/p300_104|After all, he is the King of Scotland.
p300/p300_221|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p300/p300_322|Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
p300/p300_392|I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
p300/p300_094|You had better believe it.
p300/p300_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p300/p300_349|She has seen, or heard, it all.
p300/p300_396|For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
p300/p300_170|What has caused the demise of singing?
p300/p300_312|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p300/p300_163|I took a minibus into town.
p300/p300_105|People just came on their own.
p300/p300_284|We said, What do you mean?
p300/p300_180|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p300/p300_299|They finished second and third.
p300/p300_066|He also does not get along with Christina.
p300/p300_178|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p300/p300_298|My view has now completely changed.
p300/p300_239|It's just gotten too big.
p300/p300_149|I feel my life to be at risk.
p300/p300_399|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p300/p300_090|What happens when the funding is exhausted.
p300/p300_344|He was visited by UK consular officials.
p300/p300_179|I came home by ambulance.
p300/p300_389|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p300/p300_378|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p300/p300_220|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p300/p300_320|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p300/p300_236|The success story shows no signs of stopping.
p300/p300_287|They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
p300/p300_162|Laura is an investment banker.
p300/p300_290|This is still a young team, you know.
p300/p300_183|This one was my best chance.
p300/p300_098|There are a huge number of arts.
p300/p300_048|But all forms of the illness are treatable.
p300/p300_034|Blood samples have been taken.
p300/p300_304|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p300/p300_363|This is not great, but it goes well.
p300/p300_237|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p300/p300_386|Construction would then begin.
p300/p300_125|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p300/p300_088|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p300/p300_099|They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
p300/p300_233|He will become the sovereign.
p300/p300_318|Too often it is not.
p300/p300_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p300/p300_068|How things have changed since then.
p300/p300_338|That decision was applauded by Williamson.
p300/p300_364|It's an hour of the same response.
p300/p300_235|Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
p300/p300_033|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p300/p300_393|Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
p300/p300_194|I am considered a teenager.
p300/p300_119|Completion is expected by October the following year.
p300/p300_272|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p300/p300_288|It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
p300/p300_305|People can get them if they want.
p300/p300_081|His options are severely limited.
p300/p300_387|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p300/p300_295|People will make up their own minds.
p300/p300_120|However, it very nearly all went wrong.
p300/p300_292|Everyone knew where they were.
p300/p300_258|Today's meeting was open and friendly.
p300/p300_375|We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
p300/p300_334|We will be homeless.
p300/p300_277|Tourism continues to struggle.
p300/p300_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p300/p300_171|We want to help them through it.
p300/p300_365|Both are national treasures.
p300/p300_335|I believe he can do a better job.
p300/p300_273|The board has rejected her proposals.
p300/p300_370|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p300/p300_199|I like footballers who play well.
p300/p300_227|It was a poor performance.
p300/p300_390|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p300/p300_161|You should be there with six different characters.
p300/p300_275|She is a very lucky young lady.
p300/p300_107|The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
p300/p300_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p300/p300_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p300/p300_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p300/p300_253|A management agreement, however, was conceded.
p300/p300_086|I have made good progress.
p300/p300_128|She says the royal family get on well.
p300/p300_201|The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
p300/p300_374|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p300/p300_281|This is a great shame.
p300/p300_172|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p300/p300_350|Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
p300/p300_274|It does not move, which is amazing.
p300/p300_313|Part of Johnny was found some days after.
p300/p300_092|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p300/p300_133|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p300/p300_376|The mix with Tiger is perfect.
p300/p300_121|It is not a definite proposal as yet.
p300/p300_062|This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
p300/p300_395|Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
p300/p300_029|Of course, this is nice to hear.
p300/p300_053|Retirement, who knows?
p300/p300_159|They thought they had found a home.
p300/p300_059|He was taken ill in December last year.
p300/p300_096|He told us about it the next day.
p300/p300_282|That was merely their initial problem.
p300/p300_143|He's been the key to everything.
p300/p300_398|We expect to come through on Thursday.
p300/p300_152|We came across the first set of bodies.
p300/p300_153|We need some confidence to get a win.
p300/p300_160|She collapsed and died a day later.
p300/p300_367|They are also exploited by the markets.
p300/p300_368|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p300/p300_218|Roy Keane is certainly the best.
p300/p300_031|I don't believe you own anything.
p300/p300_134|There is still much work to be done.
p300/p300_223|She didn't tell us anything new.
p300/p300_302|It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
p300/p300_145|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p300/p300_083|They are not an item.
p300/p300_047|But the law is very clear on this.
p300/p300_264|History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
p300/p300_055|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p300/p300_316|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p300/p300_136|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p300/p300_246|Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
p300/p300_080|The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
p300/p300_056|It comes on like a tidal wave.
p300/p300_373|I will never get over his death.
p300/p300_135|However, details have yet to be worked out.
p300/p300_297|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p300/p300_112|There is great relief at this point.
p300/p300_130|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p300/p300_248|However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
p300/p300_095|The mood is upbeat.
p300/p300_361|Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
p300/p300_358|You see, my back has gone.
p300/p300_151|That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
p300/p300_347|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p300/p300_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p300/p300_035|Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
p300/p300_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p300/p300_106|We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
p300/p300_167|Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
p300/p300_041|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p300/p300_254|People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
p300/p300_307|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p300/p300_082|This is truly field of miracles.
p300/p300_238|It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
p300/p300_184|We believe a third party was involved.
p300/p300_188|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p300/p300_211|He ended up a headmaster.
p300/p300_204|Donald was a man with many friends.
p300/p300_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p300/p300_065|His rival's are spoken with elan.
p300/p300_039|A further police inquiry is currently being held.
p300/p300_332|He made no big mistakes.
p300/p300_356|No person was charged.
p300/p300_097|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p300/p300_038|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p300/p300_084|Why did they let him go?
p300/p300_181|This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
p300/p300_309|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p300/p300_079|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p300/p300_182|She is living proof of their expertise.
p300/p300_327|It may also be her last.
p300/p300_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
p300/p300_325|It's good to start with Judith.
p300/p300_234|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p300/p300_206|It is turning that way all across Europe.
p300/p300_228|They may yet have the last laugh.
p300/p300_129|Does a firefighter have to be killed?
p300/p300_198|Both of them have looked good.
p300/p300_037|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
p300/p300_285|I need them to set my career.
p300/p300_093|But the relief was short-lived.
p300/p300_078|We must move on.
p300/p300_301|He was then replaced by Ross.
p300/p300_209|That night was a terrible muddle.
p300/p300_102|Where is the anthrax?
p300/p300_283|I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
p300/p300_061|It's all too short term.
p300/p300_027|It is not an amnesty.
p300/p300_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p300/p300_269|THE best marriages are made in heaven.
p300/p300_366|And here is the rub.
p300/p300_225|And that gives a kind of freedom.
p300/p300_140|All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
p300/p300_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p300/p300_054|He was shocked by what he saw.
p300/p300_280|THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
p300/p300_052|It's a grey area.
p300/p300_063|Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
p300/p300_067|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p300/p300_242|They were two different types.
p300/p300_250|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p300/p300_044|We like being the underdogs.
p300/p300_359|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p300/p300_144|Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
p300/p300_291|It's not even finished.
p300/p300_355|I didn't even have the first idea.
p300/p300_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p300/p300_046|We will continue to operate within the sport.
p300/p300_091|He then had a swipe at Hearts.
p300/p300_345|So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
p300/p300_296|After that he became more romantic.
p300/p300_385|That's the kind of thing that counts.
p300/p300_262|They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
p300/p300_336|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p300/p300_173|It has been recorded twice.
p300/p300_348|It is a simple equation.
p300/p300_371|This takes the pressure off.
p300/p300_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p300/p300_362|Butcher has only one idea in mind.
p300/p300_073|The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
p300/p300_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p300/p300_247|The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
p300/p300_384|But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
p300/p300_166|Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
p300/p300_138|We were with him the whole time.
p300/p300_232|For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
p300/p300_071|For me, the tour is wide open this year.
p300/p300_156|This is a foolish idea.
p300/p300_070|This is the way things should be handled.
p300/p300_137|One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
p300/p300_148|I was in the train station overnight.
p300/p300_317|I enjoy playing with both of them.
p300/p300_074|What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
p300/p300_051|On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
p300/p300_255|The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
p300/p300_276|The threat to rural areas is real.
p300/p300_265|Holland won by five wickets.
p300/p300_321|I got a yellow card.
p300/p300_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p300/p300_032|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p300/p300_259|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p300/p300_346|English is the language of pop music.
p300/p300_241|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p300/p300_243|It need not be like that.
p300/p300_294|In the old days, it was easy.
p300/p300_177|It shows that we are civilised society.
p300/p300_196|The FBI could become involved.
p300/p300_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p300/p300_261|If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
p300/p300_150|Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
p300/p300_057|England and Wales are likely to pull out.
p300/p300_310|There are no easy solutions to this problem.
p300/p300_271|It is worse because she suffers from angina.
p300/p300_089|We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
p300/p300_252|I just saw them for a few minutes.
p300/p300_256|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p300/p300_101|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p300/p300_216|Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
p300/p300_343|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p300/p300_169|Who do these people think they are?
p300/p300_394|The award was a lifeline for me.
p300/p300_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p300/p300_205|We played them off the pitch.
p300/p300_154|Does that put pressure on us?
p300/p300_306|Their message was simple.
p300/p300_111|I'm not a diva.
p300/p300_263|That means no more taxation by stealth.
p300/p300_380|They did not threaten anyone.
p300/p300_266|His expulsion would not solve the problem.
p300/p300_157|You might even have seen him.
p300/p300_249|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p300/p300_127|I went straight to the toilet.
p300/p300_087|We do need a new one.
p300/p300_124|I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
p300/p300_360|She looked very, very poor.
p300/p300_025|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p300/p300_229|You can feel at home in China.
p300/p300_113|Look at them after three days of rain.
p300/p300_190|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p300/p300_224|There is nothing like this back home.
p300/p300_323|I don't know what he was capable of.
p300/p300_043|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p300/p300_400|Six other people were injured.
p300/p300_045|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
p300/p300_028|The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
p300/p300_197|We have only nine months to go.
p300/p300_331|However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
p300/p300_341|We won't let you down.
p300/p300_342|What kind of person is he?
p300/p300_158|Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
p300/p300_354|You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
p300/p300_328|Maybe it helps us.
p300/p300_192|These elements are not in the book.
p300/p300_064|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p300/p300_311|An aide was constructed to get a copy.
p300/p300_195|I would like Glasgow.
p300/p300_060|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p300/p300_165|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p300/p300_109|There are some new buildings in there.
p300/p300_200|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p300/p300_210|The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
p300/p300_146|They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
p300/p300_251|I am totally horrified by the sentence.
p300/p300_203|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p300/p300_132|I've always been desperate to play this part.
p300/p300_191|Twaddle is a case in point.
p300/p300_329|Three bystanders were killed.
p300/p300_207|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p300/p300_315|A great deal has been achieved.
p300/p300_267|After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
p300/p300_369|I am really looking forward to it.
p300/p300_319|I tend not to look back.
p300/p300_333|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p300/p300_049|It is also central to the unfolding drama.
p300/p300_245|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p300/p300_340|Well, was it?
p300/p300_217|I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
p300/p300_240|Was all this really just five months ago?
p300/p300_337|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p300/p300_122|I will speak to Michael about this.
p300/p300_260|He must have something up his sleeve.
p300/p300_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p300/p300_381|Who is going to pay their wages?
p300/p300_085|Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
p300/p300_036|He said he now intends to fly today.
p300/p300_126|There is a lack of chemistry.
p300/p300_230|This is all part of opening the door.
p300/p300_108|You either have him or you don't.
p300/p300_141|That's because we work hard at it.
p300/p300_383|Even then he was in the media spotlight.
p300/p300_314|It is just completely erased.
p300/p300_330|She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p300/p300_212|He was too good for me - too consistent.
p300/p300_040|Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
p300/p300_042|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p300/p300_324|Our place as artists is to ask questions.
p300/p300_050|Except for this, it was offside.
p300/p300_117|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p300/p300_077|You'd think there was a match on today.
p300/p300_222|That was a stunning drive from Jon.
p300/p300_123|This is not understood by people outside.
p300/p300_278|That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
p300/p300_213|It is like being a qualifier again.
p300/p300_193|You look at them and you understand.
p300/p300_115|There is no point in pushing it.
p300/p300_352|Who has the second highest?
p300/p300_268|Once they go away they won't come back.
p300/p300_139|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p300/p300_142|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p300/p300_116|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p300/p300_103|Housing is in very short supply.
p300/p300_100|My office is bare.
p300/p300_308|He is a law unto himself.
p300/p300_131|That group reported just before Christmas.
p300/p300_030|It was between myself, the management, and the team.
p300/p300_257|Two things will count for us in Brussels.
p234/p234_290|The party has never fully recovered.
p234/p234_049|Part of the complex is historic.
p234/p234_068|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p234/p234_353|They have to be addressed.
p234/p234_293|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p234/p234_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p234/p234_197|He has defended the system.
p234/p234_239|However, it is not as simple as this.
p234/p234_001|Please call Stella.
p234/p234_311|It has to be enforced.
p234/p234_166|At the moment we do not understand it.
p234/p234_263|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p234/p234_233|But it may not be all bad news.
p234/p234_212|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p234/p234_131|However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
p234/p234_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p234/p234_221|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p234/p234_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p234/p234_360|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p234/p234_234|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p234/p234_222|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p234/p234_142|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p234/p234_118|When we looked at the company.
p234/p234_164|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p234/p234_026|But we will have to wait.
p234/p234_154|There is a spring in the step.
p234/p234_272|We want this place to work.
p234/p234_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p234/p234_117|And we had a good response.
p234/p234_122|That admission is not surprising.
p234/p234_313|Every one is a winner.
p234/p234_301|But that's another story for another day.
p234/p234_112|That would be a serious problem.
p234/p234_261|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p234/p234_211|The trading conditions are not good.
p234/p234_133|He had no money left to run the club.
p234/p234_132|The problem was a social problem.
p234/p234_264|Scotland played a major part in the project.
p234/p234_195|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p234/p234_137|So what is the campaign about?
p234/p234_182|There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
p234/p234_113|Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
p234/p234_099|That is the fact of the matter.
p234/p234_309|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p234/p234_055|I've never been one for complaining about the press.
p234/p234_050|The strategy is not without risk.
p234/p234_187|As, indeed, they would be.
p234/p234_025|We are a service industry.
p234/p234_111|That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
p234/p234_040|We are the party of the future.
p234/p234_120|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p234/p234_047|It depends on the decisions of the member states.
p234/p234_094|The Festival is prepared to help.
p234/p234_230|He intends to restart in the spring.
p234/p234_262|His second was a beauty.
p234/p234_297|The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
p234/p234_345|However, the devil is in the detail.
p234/p234_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p234/p234_135|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p234/p234_338|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p234/p234_062|That is all in the past.
p234/p234_139|Are you from the rugby?
p234/p234_208|Does the name matter?
p234/p234_031|It is on the internet.
p234/p234_046|The man became a reporter.
p234/p234_320|He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
p234/p234_329|The family is not interested in the value of the house.
p234/p234_043|That means an extra two years.
p234/p234_093|He is in the US.
p234/p234_201|They have to get that sorted.
p234/p234_110|We are currently working on the details.
p234/p234_102|It is much as it has been described.
p234/p234_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p234/p234_073|It starts with the script.
p234/p234_343|The market is the market.
p234/p234_223|He must have a crack at it.
p234/p234_250|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p234/p234_156|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p234/p234_259|It was a great experience.
p234/p234_312|And we can do it.
p234/p234_257|The matter is under appeal.
p234/p234_203|We can take the city.
p234/p234_057|Still, he did not let himself down this week.
p234/p234_059|There was no safety net.
p234/p234_095|By then, he was walking on water.
p234/p234_348|The answer was in space.
p234/p234_273|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p234/p234_103|Police said the family was helping with the search.
p234/p234_180|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p234/p234_204|Are you going to win?
p234/p234_096|I had a bit in hand.
p234/p234_347|The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
p234/p234_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p234/p234_219|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p234/p234_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p234/p234_315|They have set the standard.
p234/p234_067|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p234/p234_056|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p234/p234_101|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p234/p234_042|He was in his element.
p234/p234_177|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p234/p234_190|In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
p234/p234_266|Not in this production he doesn't.
p234/p234_226|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p234/p234_330|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p234/p234_193|The performance is not there.
p234/p234_321|You have to count on other people.
p234/p234_337|Hopefully, this week will be good.
p234/p234_209|I will be in Scotland.
p234/p234_158|The players were under pressure.
p234/p234_304|We're looking for unity in the council.
p234/p234_167|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p234/p234_286|Is our children learning?
p234/p234_174|That was the difference between the sides.
p234/p234_063|That could be a mistake.
p234/p234_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p234/p234_327|But it is important for a number of reasons.
p234/p234_157|I have a lot of confidence in this team.
p234/p234_255|The world is a good place.
p234/p234_232|It is the strength of the school.
p234/p234_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p234/p234_136|So, did she meet him?
p234/p234_314|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p234/p234_184|They were not seeking the right to strike.
p234/p234_148|It is expected to last a week.
p234/p234_199|I could not sit in the stands.
p234/p234_104|She was there for the start of the campaign.
p234/p234_196|Clearly, they had other problems.
p234/p234_069|The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
p234/p234_236|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p234/p234_274|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p234/p234_125|There was a lot of resentment.
p234/p234_342|We did something about it.
p234/p234_349|We are not interested in dividends.
p234/p234_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p234/p234_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p234/p234_356|That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
p234/p234_285|Do you think we're a top nation?
p234/p234_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p234/p234_081|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p234/p234_027|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p234/p234_241|A deadline is still essential.
p234/p234_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p234/p234_079|However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
p234/p234_088|Do I have a favourite?
p234/p234_186|Tony Blair has had a good conference.
p234/p234_039|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p234/p234_034|It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
p234/p234_105|He has become a monster.
p234/p234_246|Is it in the right place?
p234/p234_354|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p234/p234_178|I was always in control.
p234/p234_258|I am delighted for them.
p234/p234_152|But it is different in different regions.
p234/p234_172|I have had a good life.
p234/p234_194|It would make a lot of sense.
p234/p234_267|We can certainly build on this.
p234/p234_260|They are difficult awards to decide.
p234/p234_237|But we are not immune to the problem.
p234/p234_044|At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
p234/p234_351|His concern is only for the future.
p234/p234_134|It is not so simple.
p234/p234_140|Actors like to be in the centre.
p234/p234_070|This time, it might be for real.
p234/p234_279|However, no further action was taken by police.
p234/p234_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p234/p234_284|It is set in Paris.
p234/p234_100|It should be a condition of employment.
p234/p234_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p234/p234_205|Was it the wife?
p234/p234_130|We are committed to the ban.
p234/p234_231|He is a good friend.
p234/p234_316|This is a major property in Edinburgh.
p234/p234_189|It is simply not true.
p234/p234_292|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p234/p234_251|We have an election in eight days.
p234/p234_170|Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
p234/p234_074|We were under a bit of pressure.
p234/p234_295|He was good, but not that good.
p234/p234_240|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p234/p234_198|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p234/p234_244|What was the matter for concern?
p234/p234_126|He wanted to record the group.
p234/p234_305|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p234/p234_077|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p234/p234_268|Then was the summer of their discontent.
p234/p234_331|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p234/p234_319|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p234/p234_325|Is there a waiting list?
p234/p234_235|The conference is the first test.
p234/p234_143|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p234/p234_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p234/p234_080|On the night, it was not enough.
p234/p234_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p234/p234_252|It was far from business as usual.
p234/p234_087|So is that it, then?
p234/p234_256|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p234/p234_181|He was asked to quit.
p234/p234_083|They were badly prepared for it.
p234/p234_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p234/p234_336|This could be a mistake.
p234/p234_265|Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
p234/p234_091|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p234/p234_052|I was released after six days.
p234/p234_061|You have to be patient.
p234/p234_225|Her experience is certainly limited.
p234/p234_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p234/p234_076|We can all make a mistake.
p234/p234_188|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p234/p234_053|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p234/p234_271|Well, it was certainly different.
p234/p234_357|The City welcomed the numbers.
p234/p234_191|It is not in the public interest.
p234/p234_092|They have a further report to make in March.
p234/p234_054|We are working on it.
p234/p234_149|Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
p234/p234_334|We have to be very, very careful.
p234/p234_144|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p234/p234_115|She is not a victim.
p234/p234_146|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p234/p234_269|There is a world of difference.
p234/p234_277|That would be a danger.
p234/p234_326|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p234/p234_202|Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
p234/p234_127|However, it was a different story in the final.
p234/p234_281|I had to be into it.
p234/p234_138|And does it?
p234/p234_318|The existing structure is in trouble.
p234/p234_216|It was a management problem in the hospital.
p234/p234_296|The results are expected within days.
p234/p234_107|Everyone had to play the game.
p234/p234_323|And he's the real thing.
p234/p234_035|History is in the making.
p234/p234_270|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p234/p234_361|We never played at all.
p234/p234_030|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p234/p234_124|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p234/p234_276|The performance continues to improve.
p234/p234_278|Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
p234/p234_213|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p234/p234_350|Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
p234/p234_165|Anyone can do the sums.
p234/p234_089|What do we do?
p234/p234_317|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p234/p234_179|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p234/p234_038|Victory was never in doubt.
p234/p234_248|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p234/p234_359|There's still a bit to go.
p234/p234_086|How are you, sir?
p234/p234_333|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p234/p234_173|Three hours later, the man was free.
p234/p234_352|And it's a goodbye from him.
p234/p234_289|Are they free?
p234/p234_176|I was in a hole.
p234/p234_229|We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
p234/p234_121|The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
p234/p234_192|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p234/p234_322|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p234/p234_242|And they were being paid?
p234/p234_243|Was everything done to save people?
p234/p234_288|What form did that take?
p234/p234_175|They have not been named.
p234/p234_332|But it can be done.
p234/p234_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p234/p234_108|In London today, it was business as usual.
p234/p234_114|People have been placed in a state of alarm.
p234/p234_097|We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
p234/p234_306|They are not going the length of the pitch.
p234/p234_162|In that case, the children were not missing.
p234/p234_128|The end result is the same.
p234/p234_153|That is the nature of the game.
p234/p234_065|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p234/p234_085|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p234/p234_310|Scotland won by six wickets.
p234/p234_123|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p234/p234_161|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p234/p234_218|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p234/p234_155|We want to get there.
p234/p234_300|And it was this one.
p234/p234_200|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p234/p234_169|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p234/p234_291|In many ways, that is as important.
p234/p234_171|Much of the equipment was new.
p234/p234_339|I think the overall picture is still strong.
p234/p234_355|However, a bid was never made.
p234/p234_048|It is all starting to come together.
p234/p234_344|We do not have the papers.
p234/p234_064|It was an amazing result.
p234/p234_160|There is no common ground.
p234/p234_245|Do I think about them often?
p234/p234_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p234/p234_036|It was sold at a loss.
p234/p234_308|The concerns are the same.
p234/p234_210|It was the story of the second half.
p234/p234_224|The force is with them.
p234/p234_129|Three days later, he was killed.
p234/p234_075|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p234/p234_346|For the moment, however, the position is clear.
p234/p234_207|What do we want to do that for?
p234/p234_298|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p234/p234_254|From there, they can go anywhere.
p234/p234_247|Did he trip?
p234/p234_106|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p234/p234_145|I can't even get into the A team.
p234/p234_151|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p234/p234_185|He called for a public inquiry.
p234/p234_141|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p234/p234_358|Something is going to have to give.
p234/p234_249|You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
p234/p234_287|How independent is that?
p234/p234_168|It is not about the money, it is about everything.
p234/p234_303|If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
p234/p234_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p234/p234_340|That is always a problem.
p234/p234_060|He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
p234/p234_066|He has not been dropped.
p234/p234_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p234/p234_072|Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
p234/p234_032|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p234/p234_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p234/p234_041|I have never been a member of the council.
p234/p234_238|I was not overly concerned about this.
p234/p234_090|Why do it otherwise?
p234/p234_299|We were well worth the win.
p234/p234_328|All of the management has invested in the firm.
p234/p234_119|No, the equipment is extra.
p234/p234_163|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p234/p234_183|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p234/p234_051|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p234/p234_275|The statement contained no surprises.
p234/p234_045|All businesses continue to trade.
p234/p234_283|In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
p234/p234_033|This is a central issue.
p234/p234_294|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p234/p234_082|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p234/p234_159|Not that the occasion was without restraint.
p234/p234_147|She does not want to speak.
p234/p234_217|Being investor ready is a good start.
p234/p234_116|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p234/p234_335|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p234/p234_214|This is an interesting link.
p234/p234_228|Mr Blair was ready for him.
p234/p234_071|She did that for the rest of her life.
p234/p234_150|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p234/p234_282|My view has always been the same.
p234/p234_220|This conference was never confirmed.
p234/p234_253|It was just another play.
p234/p234_307|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p234/p234_109|It is not affected by the sale.
p234/p234_324|What are they for?
p234/p234_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p234/p234_098|I cannot wait to get started on it.
p234/p234_227|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p234/p234_302|But it was also hard.
p234/p234_084|It is not a story.
p234/p234_341|We will deliver at director level.
p234/p234_280|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p265/p265_319|Two people were interviewed.
p265/p265_338|That would help.
p265/p265_344|He could face a jail sentence.
p265/p265_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p265/p265_091|It is a love affair.
p265/p265_334|As, indeed, they would be.
p265/p265_095|We have an election in eight days.
p265/p265_165|It is not either national standards or local control.
p265/p265_288|I can live with it.
p265/p265_068|The results are tragic.
p265/p265_120|We work well together.
p265/p265_277|Dialogue is the key.
p265/p265_283|So I did.
p265/p265_308|Either team will be hard.
p265/p265_316|Who will do it?
p265/p265_041|A neighbour said.
p265/p265_154|It is not like us.
p265/p265_026|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p265/p265_306|I came into this world with nothing.
p265/p265_270|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p265/p265_139|I was stunned.
p265/p265_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p265/p265_332|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p265/p265_115|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p265/p265_346|It's been hard.
p265/p265_340|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p265/p265_294|You are the glory.
p265/p265_110|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p265/p265_050|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p265/p265_247|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p265/p265_104|It's a shame.
p265/p265_315|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p265/p265_103|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p265/p265_036|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p265/p265_181|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p265/p265_097|He takes the job.
p265/p265_246|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p265/p265_352|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p265/p265_255|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p265/p265_136|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p265/p265_170|I've been there.
p265/p265_216|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p265/p265_027|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p265/p265_278|It was a virus.
p265/p265_329|But we finished the show.
p265/p265_133|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p265/p265_163|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p265/p265_268|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p265/p265_238|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p265/p265_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p265/p265_312|Is that an issue?
p265/p265_200|I had decided to quit the show.
p265/p265_318|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p265/p265_235|Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
p265/p265_208|That has been the easy part.
p265/p265_059|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p265/p265_241|It was a hit.
p265/p265_157|They will do their own thing.
p265/p265_337|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p265/p265_040|This represents a tough game for us.
p265/p265_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p265/p265_030|It's a fact.
p265/p265_066|Is there a new way forward?
p265/p265_090|Journalists should make him.
p265/p265_245|That could be in place by next year.
p265/p265_185|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p265/p265_158|You had to go and see him.
p265/p265_304|They had a confession.
p265/p265_253|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p265/p265_111|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p265/p265_297|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
p265/p265_341|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p265/p265_314|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p265/p265_221|We are so proud.
p265/p265_053|They are real.
p265/p265_174|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p265/p265_311|The party is up for it.
p265/p265_082|It is a lifeline.
p265/p265_184|Peace was won.
p265/p265_320|I'm very lucky.
p265/p265_183|It is a farce.
p265/p265_156|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p265/p265_054|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p265/p265_129|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p265/p265_189|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p265/p265_227|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p265/p265_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p265/p265_052|It's that kind of place.
p265/p265_206|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p265/p265_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p265/p265_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p265/p265_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p265/p265_112|That's all right then.
p265/p265_146|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p265/p265_228|You should be.
p265/p265_132|He realises his mistake.
p265/p265_092|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p265/p265_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p265/p265_324|They should take their mobile phones.
p265/p265_250|We have to expand.
p265/p265_323|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p265/p265_195|It was worth a photograph.
p265/p265_274|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p265/p265_137|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p265/p265_047|It is unique.
p265/p265_143|We are now up against it.
p265/p265_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p265/p265_162|Blair's response was weak.
p265/p265_069|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p265/p265_078|They lived for their children.
p265/p265_085|This one did.
p265/p265_192|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p265/p265_292|Last night was a key episode.
p265/p265_303|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p265/p265_299|We are a peaceful people.
p265/p265_087|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p265/p265_199|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p265/p265_328|She said they would appeal.
p265/p265_207|Because they didn't want to know.
p265/p265_098|She reflects a bit.
p265/p265_259|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p265/p265_046|There was no safety net.
p265/p265_116|Twaddle is a case in point.
p265/p265_182|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p265/p265_193|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p265/p265_086|They are now divorced.
p265/p265_298|Is there on his hands?
p265/p265_113|I'm so angry.
p265/p265_119|They took a risk.
p265/p265_037|Dancing was her life.
p265/p265_106|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p265/p265_279|Yet, it worked.
p265/p265_281|This is a national crisis.
p265/p265_290|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p265/p265_243|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p265/p265_164|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p265/p265_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p265/p265_310|My view has now completely changed.
p265/p265_108|It is rubbish.
p265/p265_125|Is that it?
p265/p265_051|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p265/p265_222|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p265/p265_202|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p265/p265_186|It was very frightened and dirty.
p265/p265_048|I expect a rapid response.
p265/p265_273|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p265/p265_149|I've put my own money into this project.
p265/p265_267|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p265/p265_160|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p265/p265_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p265/p265_322|This is a friendly match?
p265/p265_236|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p265/p265_065|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p265/p265_071|What has changed?
p265/p265_188|The service from the other players was super.
p265/p265_155|Seven people were later detained by police.
p265/p265_256|Souter will be back.
p265/p265_201|People must remain vigilant.
p265/p265_096|Oil embargo endorsed.
p265/p265_242|There's the mix.
p265/p265_176|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p265/p265_262|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p265/p265_032|It has failed.
p265/p265_131|She died at her home.
p265/p265_276|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p265/p265_073|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p265/p265_326|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p265/p265_178|One was a lawyer.
p265/p265_099|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p265/p265_159|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p265/p265_205|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p265/p265_172|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p265/p265_134|The idea is simple.
p265/p265_148|I will tell you.
p265/p265_258|Blood samples were taken.
p265/p265_239|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p265/p265_080|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p265/p265_333|The pair are very much in love.
p265/p265_224|Until they came to do it.
p265/p265_223|I can leave at the end of the day.
p265/p265_042|Among them are many criminals.
p265/p265_321|It's very good.
p265/p265_226|Wealth is relative.
p265/p265_190|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p265/p265_171|It's an idea.
p265/p265_081|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p265/p265_218|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p265/p265_336|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p265/p265_327|Tell us about it.
p265/p265_191|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p265/p265_272|He looked very sharp.
p265/p265_213|It's not before time.
p265/p265_280|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p265/p265_045|I guess I was lucky, though.
p265/p265_331|There is no excuse.
p265/p265_033|It was clear.
p265/p265_219|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p265/p265_285|What has altered?
p265/p265_128|I don't know the full story.
p265/p265_260|This is a question of Islam.
p265/p265_335|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p265/p265_177|Does this matter?
p265/p265_212|I'd never seen a play about me.
p265/p265_287|There is no openness.
p265/p265_038|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p265/p265_088|I saw the whole thing.
p265/p265_067|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p265/p265_145|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p265/p265_229|It's quite nice.
p265/p265_140|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p265/p265_269|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p265/p265_058|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p265/p265_204|I might come back.
p265/p265_302|My body is clearly capable.
p265/p265_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p265/p265_293|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p265/p265_049|TODAY it begins.
p265/p265_151|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p265/p265_264|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p265/p265_197|I don't want to use it.
p265/p265_144|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p265/p265_084|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p265/p265_029|We speak about the performance.
p265/p265_300|Kids are terrible.
p265/p265_271|We have to break that cycle.
p265/p265_083|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p265/p265_254|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p265/p265_101|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p265/p265_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p265/p265_070|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p265/p265_350|So there, we won.
p265/p265_118|It plans to return to this field.
p265/p265_284|We are not going to forget.
p265/p265_124|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p265/p265_077|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p265/p265_064|Neither it is.
p265/p265_044|This is a club on the rise.
p265/p265_100|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p265/p265_152|It has to be now.
p265/p265_035|Indeed, he does.
p265/p265_296|The letters are going out today.
p265/p265_187|Is that success?
p265/p265_307|It's too horrible to think.
p265/p265_056|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p265/p265_244|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p265/p265_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p265/p265_265|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p265/p265_345|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p265/p265_166|He deserved the win.
p265/p265_130|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p265/p265_203|He seemed to lose his focus.
p265/p265_161|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p265/p265_232|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p265/p265_210|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p265/p265_214|The report is due out next month.
p265/p265_237|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p265/p265_039|It's the only thing.
p265/p265_209|But she was.
p265/p265_351|He was the architect.
p265/p265_266|They seem to get away with it.
p265/p265_282|Who did the recruiting?
p265/p265_343|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p265/p265_330|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p265/p265_248|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p265/p265_251|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p265/p265_169|They know no other way.
p265/p265_141|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p265/p265_263|It's a way of life.
p265/p265_061|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p265/p265_122|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p265/p265_138|You know the type.
p265/p265_127|I was dead.
p265/p265_220|We were awful.
p265/p265_215|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p265/p265_349|Safety was also an issue.
p265/p265_240|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p265/p265_025|Is this accurate?
p265/p265_034|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p265/p265_060|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p265/p265_291|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p265/p265_252|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p265/p265_225|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p265/p265_135|That group reported just before Christmas.
p265/p265_289|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p265/p265_153|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p265/p265_173|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p265/p265_079|It will be tight.
p265/p265_325|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p265/p265_043|She looked so young.
p265/p265_123|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p265/p265_233|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p265/p265_295|The minister is the engineer.
p265/p265_147|Well, he should know.
p265/p265_117|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p265/p265_072|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p265/p265_075|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p265/p265_317|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p265/p265_180|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p265/p265_063|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p265/p265_126|It is a time bomb.
p265/p265_211|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p265/p265_102|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p265/p265_194|It's all about money, money, money.
p265/p265_230|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p265/p265_089|It was mayhem.
p265/p265_031|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p265/p265_347|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p265/p265_076|By then, he was walking on water.
p265/p265_305|It will work.
p265/p265_198|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p265/p265_257|I am just trying to do my job.
p265/p265_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p265/p265_167|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p265/p265_142|They have not been named.
p265/p265_313|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p265/p265_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p265/p265_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p265/p265_339|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p265/p265_309|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p265/p265_057|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p265/p265_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p265/p265_179|I put the drawing down.
p265/p265_121|What will happen then?
p265/p265_105|It was the eighties.
p265/p265_275|You've got to have both sides.
p265/p265_342|There was a substantial explosion.
p265/p265_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p265/p265_301|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p265/p265_217|At the time, he was a living legend.
p265/p265_074|A play is a set of actions.
p265/p265_231|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p265/p265_175|They need to look after themselves.
p265/p265_234|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p265/p265_107|You had better believe it.
p265/p265_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p265/p265_168|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p265/p265_196|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p265/p265_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p265/p265_094|They tried to deny it.
p265/p265_150|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p265/p265_055|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p265/p265_109|Who would be a referee?
p265/p265_028|This is the window.
p265/p265_286|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p265/p265_114|Holland won by five wickets.
p265/p265_093|May not have been at fault?
p265/p265_348|A review is under way.
p265/p265_249|Chelsea was a great club.
p292/p292_066|We would certainly consider the proposals.
p292/p292_093|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
p292/p292_349|It was all too little, too late.
p292/p292_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p292/p292_409|It is good for Europe.
p292/p292_027|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p292/p292_097|That, though, is an old story.
p292/p292_269|It is a very beautiful city.
p292/p292_043|Mr Blair should be warned.
p292/p292_382|You have to rely on each other.
p292/p292_025|I was not involved in these discussions.
p292/p292_355|That didn't happen for two reasons.
p292/p292_192|Next time round, it will be different.
p292/p292_247|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p292/p292_295|They are in good spirits.
p292/p292_212|I am appalled by this news.
p292/p292_206|The next one comes up.
p292/p292_085|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p292/p292_257|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p292/p292_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p292/p292_356|It is time for a new approach.
p292/p292_334|This country has many challenges.
p292/p292_150|They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
p292/p292_174|This is a very high price.
p292/p292_217|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p292/p292_175|He is the example for all of us.
p292/p292_341|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p292/p292_094|He insisted that his staff were too.
p292/p292_137|I still think he will win.
p292/p292_207|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p292/p292_100|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p292/p292_256|This is too much like Scotland.
p292/p292_053|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p292/p292_345|Donald was his friend.
p292/p292_384|This season has been a nightmare.
p292/p292_179|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p292/p292_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p292/p292_386|He is just a wonderful actor.
p292/p292_132|What's happening to her?
p292/p292_185|He had come of age.
p292/p292_287|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p292/p292_082|I was in prison for a year.
p292/p292_329|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p292/p292_138|Elections would follow in about two years.
p292/p292_238|This is my home town.
p292/p292_136|We cannot lose it.
p292/p292_031|Three days later, he was killed.
p292/p292_351|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p292/p292_265|As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
p292/p292_318|Is he going to look after them?
p292/p292_258|That goes back a long way.
p292/p292_199|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p292/p292_229|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p292/p292_364|Everything was an effort.
p292/p292_230|If only he knew himself.
p292/p292_385|Everyone could see the joke.
p292/p292_352|There are moments of silence.
p292/p292_128|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p292/p292_371|It's their duty to protect them.
p292/p292_180|O Neill has delivered.
p292/p292_029|IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
p292/p292_088|Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
p292/p292_218|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p292/p292_226|I don't think that's very fair.
p292/p292_314|They said that they stood by their statement.
p292/p292_184|We didn't think anything would happen.
p292/p292_322|Your father was a good man.
p292/p292_423|But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
p292/p292_160|They have known the hard times.
p292/p292_037|Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
p292/p292_309|It's only tackling congestion.
p292/p292_333|It is out there.
p292/p292_342|I had to win this race.
p292/p292_090|We should be capable of managing it, though.
p292/p292_274|It won't be their last.
p292/p292_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p292/p292_127|But the killer remains at large.
p292/p292_196|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p292/p292_315|It should be equal.
p292/p292_272|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p292/p292_253|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p292/p292_255|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p292/p292_142|Now we look forward to it.
p292/p292_292|Spent three months alone at sea.
p292/p292_321|Special measures were needed.
p292/p292_285|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p292/p292_280|That never happens in real life.
p292/p292_208|We've got better players here.
p292/p292_392|It's a true story.
p292/p292_168|It's been a good year.
p292/p292_155|That takes time and games and practice.
p292/p292_047|Structural changes were also required.
p292/p292_045|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p292/p292_299|I'm going to miss it.
p292/p292_378|That would have killed the match.
p292/p292_068|His record with England was not good.
p292/p292_101|I've learned from my mistakes.
p292/p292_209|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p292/p292_167|It was the first time they met.
p292/p292_383|Politics is a tough game.
p292/p292_083|Among them is his beloved teacher.
p292/p292_058|We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
p292/p292_389|Such cases are on the increase.
p292/p292_070|Three penalties were given.
p292/p292_330|It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
p292/p292_057|One woman refused to sit down.
p292/p292_219|We're looking for unity in the council.
p292/p292_241|It is up to us to approve it.
p292/p292_316|We are on a four-year mission.
p292/p292_224|No means testing will be required.
p292/p292_081|I can't believe she is dead.
p292/p292_147|IT takes the biscuit.
p292/p292_078|THERE's only one word for it.
p292/p292_359|There's no choice is there?
p292/p292_233|Anyone else can apply.
p292/p292_169|I was never alone with her, right?
p292/p292_225|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p292/p292_419|But a surprise is in store.
p292/p292_126|We are under no illusions about this.
p292/p292_312|Friends of the family have given their support.
p292/p292_067|We tend to come good at the end.
p292/p292_166|We want to replicate that success.
p292/p292_417|I will always remember the horrible images.
p292/p292_195|We had to work hard for it.
p292/p292_348|It gives us something to work on.
p292/p292_338|They are with their father.
p292/p292_213|We were extremely arrogant.
p292/p292_252|This could prove a problem.
p292/p292_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p292/p292_095|They should come clean.
p292/p292_149|You're not going to forget something like that.
p292/p292_104|It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
p292/p292_099|Life becomes a song.
p292/p292_307|By now he was very ill with cancer.
p292/p292_204|She made no further comment.
p292/p292_368|That's why he is a national treasure.
p292/p292_325|This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
p292/p292_170|That will be vital.
p292/p292_344|The boat was fantastic.
p292/p292_291|For that much we must be grateful.
p292/p292_410|I am looking forward to this film.
p292/p292_377|It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
p292/p292_051|Five officers were injured.
p292/p292_107|That, however, is the end of the good news.
p292/p292_059|I was completely knackered.
p292/p292_267|Just what we didn't need.
p292/p292_214|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p292/p292_087|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p292/p292_268|Inquiries are still in an early stage.
p292/p292_157|It is a new company for Scotland.
p292/p292_109|It's nice to be involved.
p292/p292_328|He wanted someone young and ambitious.
p292/p292_039|And the newspapers were full of it.
p292/p292_331|The company's in good shape.
p292/p292_281|I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
p292/p292_259|I wouldn't have had the abandon.
p292/p292_164|These are serious matters.
p292/p292_075|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p292/p292_407|It will probably be my last, too.
p292/p292_148|But we are not immune to the problem.
p292/p292_243|They might well be right.
p292/p292_236|The first time you read a play.
p292/p292_201|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p292/p292_357|Now they have decided to have a rethink.
p292/p292_163|The president will not be removed from office.
p292/p292_372|The Cup has come home.
p292/p292_108|Seven people were later detained by police.
p292/p292_120|Is my wife a racist?
p292/p292_190|A crucial moment has arrived.
p292/p292_061|A killer is also on the loose.
p292/p292_165|Are you all right at the front?
p292/p292_422|We didn't get any from his face.
p292/p292_363|Glasgow is far from overload.
p292/p292_347|The girls are ready to compete.
p292/p292_221|You cannot allow it to go on.
p292/p292_049|The racist abuse was terrible.
p292/p292_408|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p292/p292_071|I didn't think they would be that stupid.
p292/p292_228|Human beings are always the same.
p292/p292_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p292/p292_038|It is just like the stock market.
p292/p292_227|He was on a horse.
p292/p292_044|The idea has potential for the future.
p292/p292_080|That was him under pressure.
p292/p292_154|He also has property interests in the country.
p292/p292_102|So far this season this approach is working.
p292/p292_350|What's the problem with change?
p292/p292_277|Dialogue is the key.
p292/p292_121|This would not be my first choice.
p292/p292_145|I have a great respect for her.
p292/p292_232|I watched a game.
p292/p292_111|What are they like?
p292/p292_308|But let's not get carried away.
p292/p292_319|He had no answer.
p292/p292_191|I have nothing to hide.
p292/p292_064|You can see how he made his money.
p292/p292_399|It is surprising to come back this way.
p292/p292_069|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p292/p292_297|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p292/p292_414|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p292/p292_065|It's really good, as long as we play well.
p292/p292_332|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p292/p292_054|I'm trying not to think about that.
p292/p292_375|That's an equally important factor.
p292/p292_290|He already had had complaints.
p292/p292_143|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p292/p292_186|We were a shambles at the back.
p292/p292_381|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p292/p292_092|His presence was very important.
p292/p292_353|Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
p292/p292_324|The whole family was in shock.
p292/p292_152|This is the root of their problems.
p292/p292_300|The atmosphere was excellent.
p292/p292_091|It was that kind of afternoon.
p292/p292_244|There is great demand for human cloning.
p292/p292_323|You do that because you want to win.
p292/p292_156|If only the acting profession was that simple.
p292/p292_114|Together they will attempt to express the whole.
p292/p292_084|He had a really frustrating time last year.
p292/p292_211|People have no chance of getting out.
p292/p292_361|Do not forget about Monaco.
p292/p292_387|Billy knew he was attracted to women.
p292/p292_286|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p292/p292_242|His musicals were very much of their time.
p292/p292_182|We will reform the welfare state.
p292/p292_240|Nothing can bring back their son.
p292/p292_052|It was all for good reason as well.
p292/p292_367|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p292/p292_250|I have played well the past two days.
p292/p292_406|A suspicion was not enough.
p292/p292_411|Colour was at the core of his life.
p292/p292_098|The real issue is personal.
p292/p292_222|It's up to the defence team.
p292/p292_074|We could easily have lost that game.
p292/p292_178|Only one person can claim the credit.
p292/p292_036|PR will be just one of them.
p292/p292_125|Britain has never had it so good.
p292/p292_337|To begin with it looks good.
p292/p292_261|We will not tolerate it.
p292/p292_304|Our task is to complete the picture.
p292/p292_124|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p292/p292_400|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p292/p292_198|You saw the pain he was in.
p292/p292_231|This action could have been avoided.
p292/p292_202|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p292/p292_393|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p292/p292_131|It is a terrible loss.
p292/p292_360|Does it, Noel?
p292/p292_113|The squad is too small.
p292/p292_296|Three hours later, the man was free.
p292/p292_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p292/p292_161|It is about the script for me.
p292/p292_335|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p292/p292_129|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p292/p292_173|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p292/p292_416|A venue was found.
p292/p292_140|I've got to get on with my career.
p292/p292_326|My whole life has changed.
p292/p292_177|Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
p292/p292_034|It was a deceit.
p292/p292_398|Several others were absent.
p292/p292_379|That's not like us at all.
p292/p292_262|It should not make the same mistake again.
p292/p292_151|The result is utterly compelling.
p292/p292_303|One was a lawyer.
p292/p292_194|Only local people are helping.
p292/p292_210|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p292/p292_001|Please call Stella.
p292/p292_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p292/p292_086|I am constantly changing my mind.
p292/p292_245|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p292/p292_153|Other forces were, however, at work.
p292/p292_395|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p292/p292_396|I'd rather have been playing.
p292/p292_144|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p292/p292_263|They loved it and it showed.
p292/p292_320|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p292/p292_317|He was always nice to me.
p292/p292_293|They are the heroes.
p292/p292_055|Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
p292/p292_412|They would not tell us.
p292/p292_112|They were back in favour with the SAC.
p292/p292_365|And does it even matter?
p292/p292_032|I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
p292/p292_397|I am immensely sad.
p292/p292_310|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p292/p292_424|It's time for a change.
p292/p292_336|I've never had problems with any football managers.
p292/p292_135|The plane was in flames
p292/p292_369|I'm delighted for Andy.
p292/p292_172|It's just a normal life.
p292/p292_282|That was the gimmick.
p292/p292_119|I was influenced by all of these things.
p292/p292_388|The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
p292/p292_117|They offered to make an investment into it.
p292/p292_391|The police are not the target.
p292/p292_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p292/p292_288|However, we had no failures in our side.
p292/p292_234|It was like the old days.
p292/p292_376|We were given a break.
p292/p292_366|My parents are exhausted.
p292/p292_260|They were not at the property yesterday.
p292/p292_294|That will be the key to success.
p292/p292_390|This was not helpful.
p292/p292_418|It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
p292/p292_405|Clark is back on top form.
p292/p292_146|I suggest a new plan.
p292/p292_264|However, by then the damage had been done.
p292/p292_183|Progress is being made but it is slow.
p292/p292_089|But he just carried on anyway.
p292/p292_134|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p292/p292_354|The board of governors must act.
p292/p292_188|One of these problems is the railways.
p292/p292_133|It was even worse than at home.
p292/p292_394|But that title is a mistake.
p292/p292_050|What is the new religion?
p292/p292_103|I have got a knife.
p292/p292_040|I wish the solutions were as easy.
p292/p292_033|Or it's not really for us, if you like.
p292/p292_246|It starts to get you down.
p292/p292_415|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p292/p292_239|That was six years ago.
p292/p292_298|I wonder if Rangers do that?
p292/p292_115|I'm just going to do my best.
p292/p292_077|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p292/p292_343|And right now, it isn't there.
p292/p292_273|The issues are very intense.
p292/p292_279|He should be worried about me.
p292/p292_362|You can't give in to the vandals.
p292/p292_374|As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
p292/p292_248|My life has been turned upside down.
p292/p292_122|It certainly should not be used too often.
p292/p292_313|This means a great deal to the families.
p292/p292_181|But there was no going back.
p292/p292_028|They are being deported from their homes.
p292/p292_373|This is a big, big win.
p292/p292_048|We suffered a lot for seven years.
p292/p292_223|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p292/p292_403|I knew she was going to win.
p292/p292_063|Our approach will be different.
p292/p292_106|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p292/p292_046|That was not due to me.
p292/p292_370|And how he kept his word.
p292/p292_284|He has changed my life forever.
p292/p292_130|I had a train to catch.
p292/p292_220|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p292/p292_251|I said, What was that about?
p292/p292_159|We don't even know his name.
p292/p292_197|This is my homeland.
p292/p292_076|There were no proposals on the table.
p292/p292_276|I'll tell you honestly.
p292/p292_141|It is a road of death.
p292/p292_035|You are in power.
p292/p292_139|However, this idea is never developed.
p292/p292_404|What is the Barnett formula?
p292/p292_302|As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
p292/p292_162|You cannot enter the clubhouse.
p292/p292_096|Let's see that increase over the years.
p292/p292_305|It may have been a cry for help.
p292/p292_271|The company reacted very, very well.
p292/p292_278|It has been only average.
p292/p292_402|We all thought we were going to die.
p292/p292_380|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p292/p292_339|This was a unique election.
p292/p292_200|Drugs are always an issue.
p292/p292_289|This is his first movie.
p292/p292_105|What did we learn?
p292/p292_270|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p292/p292_187|It's not before time.
p292/p292_301|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p292/p292_072|He was between people and God.
p292/p292_176|There is no way to do this.
p292/p292_275|You've got to have both sides.
p292/p292_249|The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
p292/p292_205|I have no conflict with them.
p292/p292_030|I thought the game was very poor.
p292/p292_306|His descent was pathetic.
p292/p292_311|We've seen that time and time again.
p292/p292_413|The balance is all wrong in this country.
p292/p292_026|O, Is he conscious?
p292/p292_266|Have we not been here before?
p292/p292_041|She does not see anything ever changing.
p292/p292_237|I was a little surprised.
p292/p292_062|Last night, the row continued.
p292/p292_042|It doesn't come any better than this.
p292/p292_401|Could they perhaps be related?
p292/p292_193|How can they get one?
p292/p292_254|His game was complete.
p292/p292_158|We should have gone solo.
p292/p292_420|You can cope with it.
p292/p292_116|At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
p292/p292_123|They will run a mile.
p292/p292_118|We have no knowledge of this.
p292/p292_215|I was just getting over the time difference.
p292/p292_079|It was very full anyway.
p292/p292_110|There could still be some to come forward.
p292/p292_203|It has affected me.
p292/p292_060|There are two interests in this woodland.
p292/p292_189|It is a very sad day.
p292/p292_283|This is a national crisis.
p292/p292_073|We are just being flooded.
p292/p292_358|Tiger is the exception.
p292/p292_171|It's a technical demand.
p292/p292_346|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p292/p292_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p292/p292_216|I am proud of moments like that.
p292/p292_340|The review has been conducted fairly.
p292/p292_421|He was back to square one.
p292/p292_327|They always seem to produce.
p292/p292_235|This was never a support group.
p292/p292_056|I find the whole affair disturbing.
p343/p343_266|As, indeed, they would be.
p343/p343_085|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p343/p343_207|He is helping police with their inquiries.
p343/p343_234|He is the saviour of South Africa.
p343/p343_196|These days are over.
p343/p343_102|I am not a doctor.
p343/p343_296|It makes no influence on the public.
p343/p343_278|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p343/p343_392|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
p343/p343_170|Do they have to create seven majors?
p343/p343_331|He was a one off.
p343/p343_162|Dancing was her life.
p343/p343_044|I had troubles with the producers.
p343/p343_297|It's ahead of Labour.
p343/p343_240|Is a drug dealer?
p343/p343_314|You know the sort of thing.
p343/p343_299|I was totally wrong.
p343/p343_323|It is so out of character.
p343/p343_180|The talking cannot go on too long.
p343/p343_120|I cannot believe this decision.
p343/p343_374|He is lying to save his skin.
p343/p343_179|This has been very frustrating for him.
p343/p343_260|And they are different.
p343/p343_071|We played too deeply.
p343/p343_173|Is something which we just don't do.
p343/p343_290|The princess has had other health problems.
p343/p343_399|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p343/p343_381|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
p343/p343_198|Well, you can have a tree.
p343/p343_175|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
p343/p343_282|Everything is so new.
p343/p343_025|I've got a long way to go.
p343/p343_284|Would they work together again?
p343/p343_077|I am about protecting the state pension.
p343/p343_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p343/p343_172|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p343/p343_332|That should give me a chance.
p343/p343_348|No one can say that about me.
p343/p343_079|I am looking forward to getting home.
p343/p343_369|The warning was lifted late last night.
p343/p343_118|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
p343/p343_311|They need to be involved.
p343/p343_368|He is a visionary.
p343/p343_302|There is no point of looking any further.
p343/p343_268|We are all suffering.
p343/p343_202|This is an internal matter.
p343/p343_281|The error appeared in a warrant.
p343/p343_244|The weather forecast isn't good.
p343/p343_119|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
p343/p343_357|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p343/p343_257|Horses are not affected.
p343/p343_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p343/p343_034|What can you do?
p343/p343_091|It's terrible that this is happening.
p343/p343_372|And if he hasn't become a musician?
p343/p343_089|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p343/p343_291|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
p343/p343_222|That was never their agenda.
p343/p343_270|That is a question for the next manager.
p343/p343_197|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p343/p343_190|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p343/p343_301|It was a matter of chance.
p343/p343_134|I haven't been able to do it since.
p343/p343_312|It was not a cover-up.
p343/p343_029|It is a crucial award.
p343/p343_106|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p343/p343_076|We are at the crossroads.
p343/p343_028|I was very, very pleased with our display.
p343/p343_035|I read it every year.
p343/p343_146|I told that to the police.
p343/p343_042|That was the theory, anyway.
p343/p343_213|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p343/p343_341|I started on fire a couple of times.
p343/p343_072|We could have got three medals.
p343/p343_112|I would love to play in Europe again.
p343/p343_354|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p343/p343_105|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p343/p343_261|It would have been very easily done.
p343/p343_107|I am not a paedophile.
p343/p343_188|It was good today.
p343/p343_293|I could not sit in the stands.
p343/p343_141|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
p343/p343_273|Again, we were lucky.
p343/p343_232|She has not returned to work.
p343/p343_321|What on earth is happening to rugby?
p343/p343_228|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p343/p343_189|She really suffered for her art.
p343/p343_178|I am looking forward to this film.
p343/p343_333|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p343/p343_049|I have no doubt about that.
p343/p343_259|I'm not going to change from it.
p343/p343_093|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p343/p343_235|The players are obviously keen to do well.
p343/p343_318|We told them in August.
p343/p343_315|I cannot say too much about them.
p343/p343_210|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
p343/p343_121|This decision is destroying my family.
p343/p343_045|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p343/p343_113|The odds are that it will.
p343/p343_147|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
p343/p343_137|All the pressure will be on him.
p343/p343_325|Our thoughts are with her.
p343/p343_001|Please call Stella.
p343/p343_322|It is now being examined.
p343/p343_263|That idea is rubbish.
p343/p343_334|It is my last chance.
p343/p343_150|I'm going to win the gold.
p343/p343_385|It almost certainly is.
p343/p343_398|There is no formula.
p343/p343_157|I can't believe the buzz.
p343/p343_219|He saw it all as a big game.
p343/p343_096|The winner will be announced next month.
p343/p343_168|He can do no wrong.
p343/p343_108|I've got to get noticed!
p343/p343_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p343/p343_256|It was totally out of the blue.
p343/p343_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p343/p343_203|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
p343/p343_047|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p343/p343_087|No one was listening.
p343/p343_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p343/p343_224|She is currently in foster care.
p343/p343_064|He has really done well.
p343/p343_277|I just need a bit of luck.
p343/p343_255|However, my position remains the same.
p343/p343_154|It's like a garage.
p343/p343_060|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
p343/p343_110|It's up to them to decide.
p343/p343_176|He will want to utilise the midfield.
p343/p343_286|The answer is yes.
p343/p343_116|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
p343/p343_039|It is up to Ann.
p343/p343_254|He says it often enough.
p343/p343_132|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p343/p343_187|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p343/p343_055|My mother is a widow.
p343/p343_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p343/p343_304|Is it the flight?
p343/p343_069|It was just awful.
p343/p343_295|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p343/p343_199|Or so it is hoped.
p343/p343_094|It is par for the course, of course.
p343/p343_377|He took away my childhood.
p343/p343_031|Survival is our aim.
p343/p343_160|It had been played at festivals.
p343/p343_127|We are not with you.
p343/p343_229|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p343/p343_280|He is not a pathetic figure.
p343/p343_352|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
p343/p343_177|Two others were also seriously injured.
p343/p343_167|Are his works inside out?
p343/p343_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p343/p343_097|What was this?
p343/p343_367|In the end, however, it all came together.
p343/p343_143|He had finally had enough.
p343/p343_225|That's the only thing that matters.
p343/p343_211|We want to get there.
p343/p343_289|That is a personal matter.
p343/p343_057|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p343/p343_033|Nor is it likely to do so.
p343/p343_133|The referee had a shocking game.
p343/p343_145|We are not going to get carried away.
p343/p343_104|And we have beaten them before.
p343/p343_262|He knows the course.
p343/p343_164|Staff have been informed.
p343/p343_230|You have a very persuasive president.
p343/p343_310|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
p343/p343_371|I have to take some of the blame.
p343/p343_326|It is time, he said.
p343/p343_313|The children continue to talk to us.
p343/p343_279|We are talking about one family.
p343/p343_387|Because it's a secret.
p343/p343_067|Funding needs to be long term.
p343/p343_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p343/p343_298|It's the whole package.
p343/p343_324|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
p343/p343_139|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p343/p343_264|There is no room for error.
p343/p343_201|He said to give a local injection.
p343/p343_274|There was no argument.
p343/p343_349|That had not happened on this occasion.
p343/p343_327|Everyone believes in it.
p343/p343_336|The service from the other players was super.
p343/p343_054|I must take a seat.
p343/p343_065|I'm just delighted to take it.
p343/p343_051|I expect a rapid response.
p343/p343_151|He pleaded for caution.
p343/p343_040|And you know something?
p343/p343_383|And there is another problem.
p343/p343_335|We played them off the pitch.
p343/p343_238|Our positions remains unchanged.
p343/p343_053|This was never a support group.
p343/p343_350|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p343/p343_026|I'll go to the races.
p343/p343_027|We will be back next year.
p343/p343_136|For a few years we had good fun.
p343/p343_365|We had to take action to protect them.
p343/p343_269|People should make their own decisions.
p343/p343_339|You have been warned.
p343/p343_181|I've got a young family.
p343/p343_218|If he leaves, the band is finished.
p343/p343_358|It is a gamble.
p343/p343_215|The hearing was fair.
p343/p343_092|He's got the same story.
p343/p343_205|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
p343/p343_095|And so it goes on.
p343/p343_347|That will just be the beginning.
p343/p343_195|The hotel was huge.
p343/p343_378|I have spoken to the skipper.
p343/p343_032|But it might have done.
p343/p343_020|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p343/p343_155|They've been wonderful to me.
p343/p343_247|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p343/p343_223|But he kept on repeating it.
p343/p343_364|There's a hint of classical.
p343/p343_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p343/p343_391|They are there to help us.
p343/p343_078|They were at school together.
p343/p343_217|This was not a summit about the euro.
p343/p343_109|Not that it was needed.
p343/p343_370|There is always the smell.
p343/p343_265|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p343/p343_111|But we can't have a casino.
p343/p343_276|She is a valuable member of Government.
p343/p343_221|Here we have not had one hour.
p343/p343_206|I was influenced by all of these things.
p343/p343_353|It is safe in our hands.
p343/p343_075|The script was funny.
p343/p343_382|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
p343/p343_340|We're not comparing like with like.
p343/p343_184|Footage has been passed on to the police.
p343/p343_186|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
p343/p343_319|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p343/p343_316|She went home from school and never returned.
p343/p343_209|Children also died in Britain.
p343/p343_086|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p343/p343_389|The body follows the mind.
p343/p343_386|They will have five minutes to decide.
p343/p343_123|Well, the big day has arrived.
p343/p343_084|I didn't understand it.
p343/p343_083|That was the easy election.
p343/p343_182|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
p343/p343_292|The clarity is vital.
p343/p343_122|Why is that?
p343/p343_061|He should be a great asset.
p343/p343_338|He didn't let me down.
p343/p343_056|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p343/p343_393|You take a risk.
p343/p343_192|It has been a magical moment.
p343/p343_397|I have hardly any commitments.
p343/p343_328|We must learn to finish.
p343/p343_307|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
p343/p343_237|It's really good fun.
p343/p343_124|We reckon we can do very well.
p343/p343_159|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p343/p343_068|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p343/p343_342|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
p343/p343_300|This has got to stop.
p343/p343_396|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p343/p343_080|Painful, but only because it's true.
p343/p343_308|They really shouldn't have put it out.
p343/p343_163|The latter way is my way.
p343/p343_193|Is that not uncanny?
p343/p343_251|We will turn the corner.
p343/p343_153|Only one got through.
p343/p343_267|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
p343/p343_100|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
p343/p343_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p343/p343_073|I am ready to go.
p343/p343_356|It comes down to the police in England.
p343/p343_117|He also has property interests in the country.
p343/p343_059|I don't believe in gesture politics.
p343/p343_088|I will report in the spring.
p343/p343_098|I am not a fan of books.
p343/p343_130|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p343/p343_242|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
p343/p343_144|But not all were so defiant.
p343/p343_058|The matter will come up again.
p343/p343_250|Actually, nothing much will change.
p343/p343_165|It is one of those things.
p343/p343_390|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
p343/p343_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p343/p343_226|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p343/p343_169|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p343/p343_174|That began as an accident.
p343/p343_320|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
p343/p343_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p343/p343_395|Each one is as good as the other.
p343/p343_337|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
p343/p343_252|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p343/p343_345|So you let me know.
p343/p343_038|We are a team of hard workers.
p343/p343_135|It's about doing things.
p343/p343_046|He died the following year.
p343/p343_236|Men should avoid it like the plague.
p343/p343_303|It is a real concern.
p343/p343_231|It's always the same, isn't it?
p343/p343_036|I go in for the parts.
p343/p343_171|It has been handled entirely properly.
p343/p343_306|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
p343/p343_208|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p343/p343_131|The answer is maybe.
p343/p343_152|It always had to be about the gym.
p343/p343_128|Then came the crunch.
p343/p343_283|It may take time to get it back.
p343/p343_363|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
p343/p343_241|We did not complete the process.
p343/p343_309|A compromise is essential.
p343/p343_249|It's still got that at its heart.
p343/p343_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p343/p343_166|His is a success story by any standard.
p343/p343_285|I can feel the sound inside.
p343/p343_379|The call was ignored.
p343/p343_366|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
p343/p343_041|We were with him the whole time.
p343/p343_245|They have not been named.
p343/p343_355|We will need to look at that.
p343/p343_227|The service will only survive with change.
p343/p343_090|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p343/p343_126|It has been a great day.
p343/p343_344|They will be up for it for sure.
p343/p343_400|I love the feel of the place.
p343/p343_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p343/p343_063|One thing is sure.
p343/p343_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p343/p343_233|We could learn a lot from them.
p343/p343_253|There were too many mistakes.
p343/p343_271|I knew people on that committee.
p343/p343_194|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p343/p343_149|But when we do it it is great.
p343/p343_062|But that's another story for another day.
p343/p343_129|If so, they were wrong.
p343/p343_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p343/p343_317|I will work on her.
p343/p343_362|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p343/p343_074|We are still suffering from that.
p343/p343_361|These things have not happened by accident.
p343/p343_191|That tells you something.
p343/p343_148|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
p343/p343_066|This happened on three days inside a week.
p343/p343_161|That never came to court as a charge.
p343/p343_243|Where are you taking her?
p343/p343_246|He died later in hospital.
p343/p343_394|Which he is, too.
p343/p343_125|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p343/p343_183|But experience is a wonderful thing.
p343/p343_082|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p343/p343_384|That is the theory.
p343/p343_220|I didn't actually work up a speech.
p343/p343_052|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p343/p343_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p343/p343_275|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
p343/p343_050|It is a beautiful country.
p343/p343_103|It is all in the mind.
p343/p343_346|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p343/p343_114|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p343/p343_216|He has the edge.
p343/p343_351|As a nation, we must become more active.
p343/p343_101|We can only go up.
p343/p343_158|It is a traffic warden.
p343/p343_081|Once they go away they won't come back.
p343/p343_043|We've all been here before.
p343/p343_239|We are expecting a big crowd.
p343/p343_185|Of course, there was still much to be done.
p343/p343_294|He had a decision to make.
p343/p343_343|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
p343/p343_037|It should be the reverse.
p343/p343_287|I believe in debate and dialogue.
p343/p343_019|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p343/p343_248|He had a great game.
p343/p343_030|People don't feel safe, including me.
p343/p343_375|You have to do your research.
p343/p343_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p343/p343_204|They made such decisions in London.
p343/p343_388|My wife and family are the support system.
p343/p343_115|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
p343/p343_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p343/p343_214|He said he would appeal the sentences.
p343/p343_359|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p343/p343_288|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p343/p343_099|It may well have been.
p343/p343_140|That was a good effort.
p343/p343_070|That is really all.
p343/p343_360|The tribunal continues today.
p343/p343_376|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
p343/p343_258|It went on forever.
p343/p343_142|He must not be removed from office.
p343/p343_048|He is trying really hard.
p241/p241_062|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p241/p241_175|And I saw the light!
p241/p241_193|Off I went.
p241/p241_130|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p241/p241_096|The peace process will be buried!
p241/p241_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p241/p241_206|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p241/p241_052|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p241/p241_173|One season, they might do well.
p241/p241_343|Tiger is the exception.
p241/p241_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p241/p241_244|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p241/p241_132|What will happen then?
p241/p241_027|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p241/p241_103|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p241/p241_274|It was a privilege to work for him.
p241/p241_026|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p241/p241_082|I first met him last summer.
p241/p241_347|I got a yellow card.
p241/p241_160|We do not get that impression now.
p241/p241_041|It was ugly.
p241/p241_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p241/p241_042|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p241/p241_110|We want to help them through it.
p241/p241_301|This is a war over our home.
p241/p241_220|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p241/p241_036|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p241/p241_224|But it will be sorted out this week.
p241/p241_073|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p241/p241_320|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p241/p241_215|We want to keep the pound.
p241/p241_271|But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p241/p241_120|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p241/p241_182|They will run a mile.
p241/p241_162|We have to move forward.
p241/p241_373|Talks are progressing.
p241/p241_116|I'm delighted about that.
p241/p241_117|I joined a group.
p241/p241_095|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p241/p241_254|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p241/p241_137|It was typical.
p241/p241_083|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p241/p241_163|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p241/p241_030|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p241/p241_211|It had all been arranged.
p241/p241_046|That time has passed.
p241/p241_195|It's the same old story.
p241/p241_200|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p241/p241_365|The play is based on a real-life event.
p241/p241_115|He will emerge as a world leader.
p241/p241_304|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p241/p241_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p241/p241_192|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p241/p241_067|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p241/p241_374|There is no signature.
p241/p241_058|I was an athlete.
p241/p241_292|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p241/p241_363|Equity declined to comment.
p241/p241_142|He is severe.
p241/p241_362|This is a club on the rise.
p241/p241_143|Is that Titanic?
p241/p241_045|We need to chat.
p241/p241_289|It changed my life.
p241/p241_199|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p241/p241_071|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p241/p241_001|Please call Stella.
p241/p241_300|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p241/p241_225|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p241/p241_253|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p241/p241_327|I'd like to take the plunge.
p241/p241_149|We want to see the maximum of change.
p241/p241_079|This is the way things should be handled.
p241/p241_285|The death toll included five children.
p241/p241_068|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p241/p241_257|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p241/p241_155|Was this element always there?
p241/p241_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p241/p241_087|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p241/p241_345|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p241/p241_134|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p241/p241_038|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p241/p241_261|It looks as though he will be right.
p241/p241_302|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p241/p241_109|You had better believe it.
p241/p241_152|They were later discharged from hospital.
p241/p241_080|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p241/p241_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p241/p241_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p241/p241_108|Is that right?
p241/p241_264|Immediate action must be taken.
p241/p241_050|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p241/p241_344|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p241/p241_146|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p241/p241_140|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p241/p241_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p241/p241_353|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p241/p241_123|I'm so angry.
p241/p241_309|Is there on his hands?
p241/p241_094|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p241/p241_251|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p241/p241_184|We did everything by the book.
p241/p241_295|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p241/p241_121|You can spend money on housing.
p241/p241_179|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p241/p241_260|It was good fun.
p241/p241_281|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p241/p241_310|It was a question of patience.
p241/p241_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p241/p241_336|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p241/p241_303|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p241/p241_216|I was so nervous.
p241/p241_070|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p241/p241_294|What has altered?
p241/p241_158|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p241/p241_138|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p241/p241_272|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p241/p241_051|He looks like an Afghan.
p241/p241_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p241/p241_262|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p241/p241_180|They know no other way.
p241/p241_360|We are looking for perfection.
p241/p241_214|It's been a good year.
p241/p241_342|I would miss him.
p241/p241_255|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p241/p241_139|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p241/p241_091|Now the system is right behind us.
p241/p241_077|Even the one she loved.
p241/p241_275|It's so awful.
p241/p241_239|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p241/p241_258|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p241/p241_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p241/p241_177|The clarity is vital.
p241/p241_297|Our task is to complete the picture.
p241/p241_279|I saw it at a ruck.
p241/p241_144|That group reported just before Christmas.
p241/p241_250|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p241/p241_325|I think I was recorded with a video camera.
p241/p241_358|That would help.
p241/p241_350|There is a cup final at stake.
p241/p241_176|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p241/p241_349|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p241/p241_101|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p241/p241_330|Who was the mystery MP?
p241/p241_035|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p241/p241_064|The script was funny.
p241/p241_105|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p241/p241_119|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p241/p241_217|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p241/p241_204|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p241/p241_078|I've got the shirt.
p241/p241_333|Who will do it?
p241/p241_223|We played them off the pitch.
p241/p241_189|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p241/p241_296|It just came into my head that day.
p241/p241_338|The train was on time.
p241/p241_237|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p241/p241_207|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p241/p241_065|He could make it.
p241/p241_232|Hospitals are for the ill.
p241/p241_209|But I am a worried man.
p241/p241_066|Try to save us.
p241/p241_168|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p241/p241_171|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p241/p241_370|Safety was also an issue.
p241/p241_135|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p241/p241_098|I love the Dome.
p241/p241_059|There was a battle there.
p241/p241_354|As, indeed, they would be.
p241/p241_039|It is not for any other purpose.
p241/p241_322|It is a strong case.
p241/p241_259|That's the only thing I will say.
p241/p241_284|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p241/p241_151|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p241/p241_150|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p241/p241_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p241/p241_099|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p241/p241_277|We are a grandmother.
p241/p241_056|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p241/p241_075|It is a job creation scheme.
p241/p241_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p241/p241_210|He knows a lot.
p241/p241_187|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p241/p241_129|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p241/p241_203|He's not perfect.
p241/p241_197|Is that success?
p241/p241_269|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p241/p241_183|Four policemen were wounded.
p241/p241_088|And rugby fans can help.
p241/p241_291|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p241/p241_249|This is the culture change in medicine.
p241/p241_093|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p241/p241_074|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p241/p241_268|And Michael was just great.
p241/p241_124|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p241/p241_048|He is too weak to move.
p241/p241_157|It was so new, so exciting.
p241/p241_241|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p241/p241_228|Who would be right?
p241/p241_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p241/p241_148|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p241/p241_288|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p241/p241_231|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p241/p241_243|The scene is about this?
p241/p241_170|He was a crazy man.
p241/p241_106|I'm not depressed.
p241/p241_252|Special measures were needed.
p241/p241_188|I wish I could say something.
p241/p241_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p241/p241_235|We were extremely poor.
p241/p241_126|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p241/p241_190|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p241/p241_315|The home team had an amazing start.
p241/p241_037|It's nice to hear.
p241/p241_240|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p241/p241_167|The post will be unpaid.
p241/p241_321|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p241/p241_371|Well, the big day has arrived.
p241/p241_055|Next league matches Celtic.
p241/p241_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p241/p241_266|It left me with a sadness.
p241/p241_331|It's been hard.
p241/p241_306|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p241/p241_212|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p241/p241_122|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p241/p241_337|I must make that clear.
p241/p241_196|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p241/p241_174|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p241/p241_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p241/p241_305|And he goes with it.
p241/p241_072|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p241/p241_165|There was no respite.
p241/p241_049|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p241/p241_164|We have a budget in March.
p241/p241_166|They will do their own thing.
p241/p241_043|That period was a struggle.
p241/p241_063|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p241/p241_326|We agreed to disagree.
p241/p241_307|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p241/p241_366|He could face a jail sentence.
p241/p241_312|Kids are terrible.
p241/p241_047|As she explains.
p241/p241_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p241/p241_208|I don't want to use it.
p241/p241_329|I've not thought about it.
p241/p241_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p241/p241_114|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p241/p241_169|It is too much for me.
p241/p241_191|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p241/p241_127|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p241/p241_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p241/p241_136|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p241/p241_245|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p241/p241_278|We have to break that cycle.
p241/p241_357|Our numbers are small.
p241/p241_324|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p241/p241_283|I should think so, too.
p241/p241_111|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p241/p241_100|It was mayhem.
p241/p241_031|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p241/p241_084|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p241/p241_364|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p241/p241_290|A new school will be built.
p241/p241_069|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p241/p241_234|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p241/p241_293|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p241/p241_104|They will want to perform well.
p241/p241_147|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p241/p241_128|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p241/p241_172|It became a book by itself.
p241/p241_314|Craig is a major concern for us.
p241/p241_270|Access has been a nightmare.
p241/p241_227|The track is currently covered in snow.
p241/p241_233|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p241/p241_032|This is the window.
p241/p241_219|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p241/p241_286|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p241/p241_040|President Bush is at war.
p241/p241_222|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p241/p241_102|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p241/p241_247|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p241/p241_218|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p241/p241_181|It is minute.
p241/p241_299|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p241/p241_213|His third goal was superb.
p241/p241_369|There was no hint of scandal.
p241/p241_057|What was the main difference?
p241/p241_356|It benefits the whole family.
p241/p241_033|People love to see this stuff.
p241/p241_246|They are different types.
p241/p241_154|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p241/p241_282|Yet, it worked.
p241/p241_311|I was rubbish.
p241/p241_334|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p241/p241_061|It was all in a short period of time.
p241/p241_256|They are real.
p241/p241_340|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p241/p241_113|It's not fair.
p241/p241_153|Neither side can win this war.
p241/p241_198|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p241/p241_081|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p241/p241_125|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p241/p241_332|They should stop the bombing.
p241/p241_346|His contract was then not renewed.
p241/p241_352|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p241/p241_328|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p241/p241_159|I've put my own money into this project.
p241/p241_229|It is set in Paris.
p241/p241_092|Today I couldn't run on it.
p241/p241_118|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p241/p241_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p241/p241_317|It is out there.
p241/p241_185|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p241/p241_265|It's very nice.
p241/p241_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p241/p241_276|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p241/p241_308|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p241/p241_107|It was his job to check.
p241/p241_313|It should be equal.
p241/p241_248|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p241/p241_230|It is not the message alone.
p241/p241_053|However the drama was still not at an end.
p241/p241_273|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p241/p241_089|They have not done so this season so far.
p241/p241_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p241/p241_226|My neighbours are horrified.
p241/p241_267|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p241/p241_242|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p241/p241_372|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p241/p241_085|Someone who cares
p241/p241_133|It's not true.
p241/p241_221|You have to do your research.
p241/p241_044|This represents a tough game for us.
p241/p241_112|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p241/p241_076|He is now resident in England.
p241/p241_298|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p241/p241_186|What has caused the demise of singing?
p241/p241_323|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p241/p241_368|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p241/p241_319|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p241/p241_359|So I left.
p241/p241_145|I am just trying to do my job.
p241/p241_202|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p241/p241_236|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p241/p241_090|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p241/p241_178|I drove the ball well.
p241/p241_034|And we have a singer.
p241/p241_238|It is hard won.
p241/p241_141|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p241/p241_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p241/p241_280|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p241/p241_287|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p241/p241_161|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p241/p241_351|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p276/p276_147|We just have to adapt.
p276/p276_347|You just have to give yourself a chance.
p276/p276_191|That will be the sweetness.
p276/p276_155|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p276/p276_345|This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
p276/p276_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p276/p276_299|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p276/p276_291|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p276/p276_051|Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
p276/p276_030|They might have asked, for goodness sake.
p276/p276_141|Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
p276/p276_236|Bottling is now the core business.
p276/p276_309|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p276/p276_144|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p276/p276_132|The Queen Mother is dead.
p276/p276_382|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p276/p276_396|He is obviously very dangerous.
p276/p276_208|My father died in childbirth.
p276/p276_076|He confirmed that the document was valid.
p276/p276_127|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p276/p276_151|Was it the wife?
p276/p276_402|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p276/p276_231|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p276/p276_257|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p276/p276_409|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p276/p276_401|It had so much to do with output.
p276/p276_233|It would make a lot of sense.
p276/p276_265|I would have been shot dead in bed.
p276/p276_432|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p276/p276_465|We are having a look.
p276/p276_029|What do we do?
p276/p276_177|They exist in name alone.
p276/p276_044|This is slightly negative for inflation.
p276/p276_315|It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
p276/p276_225|You are a gambling man.
p276/p276_460|We will pay their bills.
p276/p276_214|We did what we had to do.
p276/p276_353|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p276/p276_047|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p276/p276_227|My daughter is an adult.
p276/p276_083|So what is the campaign about?
p276/p276_383|We played them off the pitch.
p276/p276_210|This should begin in October.
p276/p276_041|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p276/p276_407|Its failure is no surprise.
p276/p276_275|Is it in the right place?
p276/p276_418|A, The media has been great.
p276/p276_224|Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
p276/p276_126|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p276/p276_136|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p276/p276_102|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p276/p276_287|It's never great to finish second.
p276/p276_108|People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
p276/p276_205|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p276/p276_117|Those people must be accountable.
p276/p276_292|However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
p276/p276_358|Is there a waiting list?
p276/p276_237|She died at her home.
p276/p276_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p276/p276_063|We like being the underdogs.
p276/p276_215|The squad is too small.
p276/p276_349|You have caught a serial killer.
p276/p276_405|Have I really come to this?
p276/p276_043|I might well have done so already.
p276/p276_439|Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
p276/p276_118|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p276/p276_350|I won't make an official complaint.
p276/p276_226|Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
p276/p276_456|Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
p276/p276_059|He is too weak to move.
p276/p276_380|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p276/p276_201|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p276/p276_182|There's still plenty time left.
p276/p276_374|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p276/p276_328|What form did that take?
p276/p276_406|David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
p276/p276_170|Nato has left them with no other option.
p276/p276_330|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p276/p276_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p276/p276_189|The changes took effect from June.
p276/p276_098|It was exactly four months away.
p276/p276_216|What do we want to do that for?
p276/p276_296|A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
p276/p276_124|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p276/p276_253|For business, the benefits will be enormous.
p276/p276_335|The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
p276/p276_085|Carlton also declined to comment last night.
p276/p276_378|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p276/p276_446|He was due to retire in December.
p276/p276_427|Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
p276/p276_071|Let's not be too despondent.
p276/p276_089|Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
p276/p276_360|So what happens next?
p276/p276_095|He's not getting into any games.
p276/p276_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p276/p276_271|And they were being paid?
p276/p276_277|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p276/p276_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p276/p276_220|I think, therefore I am?
p276/p276_128|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p276/p276_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p276/p276_120|Choice is a good thing.
p276/p276_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p276/p276_334|I was inspired by two things.
p276/p276_197|The feedback from them has been fantastic.
p276/p276_464|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p276/p276_413|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p276/p276_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p276/p276_221|You've got to be vigilant.
p276/p276_088|Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
p276/p276_463|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p276/p276_160|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p276/p276_171|Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
p276/p276_414|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p276/p276_037|We speak about the performance.
p276/p276_119|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p276/p276_268|We will turn the corner.
p276/p276_091|He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
p276/p276_123|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p276/p276_393|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p276/p276_082|So, did she meet him?
p276/p276_057|Among them are many criminals.
p276/p276_104|Context is also very important.
p276/p276_293|That would open the gates of hell.
p276/p276_301|This championship is different from the other majors.
p276/p276_319|I'm interested in interesting work.
p276/p276_046|We believe a third party was involved.
p276/p276_186|The festivals will be about having fun.
p276/p276_173|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p276/p276_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p276/p276_202|That was just one night.
p276/p276_194|There was a fossil on screen.
p276/p276_331|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p276/p276_417|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p276/p276_111|He's been active in Arabia.
p276/p276_361|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p276/p276_116|I've had it for the exams.
p276/p276_356|There is no quick fix.
p276/p276_140|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p276/p276_455|We are aiming for early March.
p276/p276_437|I always savour the company of The Voice.
p276/p276_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p276/p276_052|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p276/p276_387|The statement contained no surprises.
p276/p276_106|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p276/p276_247|That group reported just before Christmas.
p276/p276_209|It is quite a thing to watch.
p276/p276_093|Funding needs to be long term.
p276/p276_158|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p276/p276_376|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p276/p276_373|Brown has always protested his innocence.
p276/p276_394|He ended up a headmaster.
p276/p276_172|He was just like a godfather to it.
p276/p276_072|There was no safety net.
p276/p276_196|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p276/p276_078|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p276/p276_115|He was unprepared for this fight.
p276/p276_192|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p276/p276_065|This trend is likely to strengthen.
p276/p276_322|I saw them last week.
p276/p276_259|Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
p276/p276_370|The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
p276/p276_174|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p276/p276_359|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p276/p276_145|The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
p276/p276_232|I never wanted a legal battle.
p276/p276_139|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p276/p276_260|They've got some extremely good players.
p276/p276_159|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p276/p276_131|Diversions were put in place.
p276/p276_372|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p276/p276_342|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p276/p276_324|Did it work?
p276/p276_075|A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
p276/p276_412|Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
p276/p276_286|Their extinction is not inevitable.
p276/p276_288|And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
p276/p276_064|He looks like an Afghan.
p276/p276_169|His job was not advertised.
p276/p276_181|I can see it now.
p276/p276_327|How independent is that?
p276/p276_212|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p276/p276_165|He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
p276/p276_183|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p276/p276_148|Are you from the rugby?
p276/p276_375|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p276/p276_152|Why change it?
p276/p276_320|We represent a wide range of society.
p276/p276_270|My Dad is a hero.
p276/p276_027|So is that it, then?
p276/p276_190|As if that is an achievement.
p276/p276_457|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p276/p276_415|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p276/p276_461|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p276/p276_304|Each case is treated on merit.
p276/p276_048|It carried a double message.
p276/p276_329|Are they free?
p276/p276_426|They made such decisions in London.
p276/p276_252|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p276/p276_045|And they had a case.
p276/p276_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p276/p276_366|The business has expanded rapidly, however.
p276/p276_314|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p276/p276_440|I got a yellow card.
p276/p276_134|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p276/p276_080|Why do it otherwise?
p276/p276_339|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p276/p276_142|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p276/p276_403|After the match, do you?
p276/p276_447|We go there with confidence.
p276/p276_068|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p276/p276_121|I am not very pleased.
p276/p276_395|North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
p276/p276_420|I have received no explanation.
p276/p276_323|Does that put pressure on us?
p276/p276_242|How do you take them away?
p276/p276_310|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p276/p276_149|What happened in that game?
p276/p276_211|Twaddle is a case in point.
p276/p276_445|We accept the new rules.
p276/p276_352|I grew up with that in the amateur game.
p276/p276_175|These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
p276/p276_219|What are you not good at?
p276/p276_239|What do they want us to do?
p276/p276_060|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p276/p276_039|Further management changes are planned.
p276/p276_388|Six other people were injured.
p276/p276_070|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p276/p276_031|Smoking is also very important.
p276/p276_428|It seems a waste of talents.
p276/p276_297|We have to keep our clients.
p276/p276_258|I felt we deserved the three points.
p276/p276_198|That admission is not surprising.
p276/p276_061|They desperately want some stability.
p276/p276_423|You didn't need to pay.
p276/p276_243|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p276/p276_311|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p276/p276_367|From there, they can go anywhere.
p276/p276_256|Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
p276/p276_441|It's an option, but I can't really comment.
p276/p276_425|But nothing could be done.
p276/p276_307|I am astonished at attack.
p276/p276_337|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p276/p276_234|It was started almost by accident.
p276/p276_222|I learned that only yesterday.
p276/p276_157|We made a world record together.
p276/p276_318|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p276/p276_436|They make the right decisions.
p276/p276_137|He had missed a penalty against the English.
p276/p276_421|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p276/p276_348|They would be supported by visiting specialists.
p276/p276_280|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p276/p276_369|Truth is the child of time.
p276/p276_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p276/p276_168|City sentiment is in his favour.
p276/p276_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p276/p276_306|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p276/p276_240|Is it worth it?
p276/p276_266|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p276/p276_184|I've no idea how it works.
p276/p276_452|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p276/p276_450|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p276/p276_438|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p276/p276_103|It wasn't possible to relax.
p276/p276_122|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p276/p276_404|Has the conflict started?
p276/p276_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p276/p276_235|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p276/p276_105|There could be a way back.
p276/p276_341|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p276/p276_326|Is our children learning?
p276/p276_294|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p276/p276_321|It caused a lot of upset.
p276/p276_238|Had this been common practice?
p276/p276_074|He phoned the number in the brochure.
p276/p276_200|However, the problem is the timing.
p276/p276_206|Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
p276/p276_135|Margins are also in retreat.
p276/p276_313|We've had great things in the past.
p276/p276_193|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p276/p276_442|Not many people like to do that.
p276/p276_086|But the organisers refused to worry.
p276/p276_390|We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
p276/p276_187|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p276/p276_167|Before the game we went for a pint.
p276/p276_267|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p276/p276_217|Does the name matter?
p276/p276_161|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p276/p276_443|He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
p276/p276_053|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p276/p276_179|You had better believe it.
p276/p276_381|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p276/p276_038|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p276/p276_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p276/p276_273|What was the matter for concern?
p276/p276_263|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p276/p276_129|They lived for their children.
p276/p276_254|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p276/p276_073|The Government does not go far enough.
p276/p276_357|What are they for?
p276/p276_355|Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
p276/p276_028|Do I have a favourite?
p276/p276_400|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p276/p276_249|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p276/p276_153|And they all have a vote.
p276/p276_251|That view has not altered.
p276/p276_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p276/p276_185|The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
p276/p276_448|They are interior designers and architects.
p276/p276_298|Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
p276/p276_180|It was a sobering experience.
p276/p276_154|But they must believe in themselves.
p276/p276_379|Laura is an investment banker.
p276/p276_325|Do you think we are a top nation?
p276/p276_458|It will take place in July.
p276/p276_424|The might be rolled out.
p276/p276_368|I had relied on him.
p276/p276_264|The family kept away from me.
p276/p276_230|The refund is fully justified.
p276/p276_429|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p276/p276_056|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p276/p276_066|He will need that machine.
p276/p276_156|Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
p276/p276_164|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p276/p276_036|A fiver and I'll tell.
p276/p276_332|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p276/p276_203|This is a frightening development.
p276/p276_454|They must play for each other.
p276/p276_363|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p276/p276_229|There was a fine line to tread.
p276/p276_365|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p276/p276_295|We've made a couple of albums.
p276/p276_300|Everything else is a bonus.
p276/p276_410|Those overseas offices were great.
p276/p276_245|We were right to be afraid.
p276/p276_176|It took five months to repair the damage.
p276/p276_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p276/p276_079|I have made that offer.
p276/p276_228|I would not say that.
p276/p276_462|It was very positive and very helpful.
p276/p276_283|I've come here for the jersey.
p276/p276_308|Says the Duke of York.
p276/p276_025|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p276/p276_130|Potions said he would drive.
p276/p276_386|It must be tough to live with.
p276/p276_338|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p276/p276_199|But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
p276/p276_032|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p276/p276_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p276/p276_133|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p276/p276_084|The new deal will now be put to the officers.
p276/p276_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p276/p276_058|And they removed a Borderer.
p276/p276_050|But not a penny has been paid.
p276/p276_344|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p276/p276_282|Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
p276/p276_026|How are you, sir?
p276/p276_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p276/p276_213|Some promoters made insulting offers.
p276/p276_284|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p276/p276_422|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p276/p276_302|At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
p276/p276_110|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p276/p276_094|We should all be grateful.
p276/p276_312|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p276/p276_384|But the rally was short-lived.
p276/p276_096|The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
p276/p276_290|We have a budget in March.
p276/p276_040|I can feel the sound inside.
p276/p276_449|He was released after treatment.
p276/p276_351|It was worth a photograph.
p276/p276_389|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p276/p276_241|Does it matter?
p276/p276_346|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p276/p276_143|Absences should be carefully monitored.
p276/p276_285|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p276/p276_316|It has been recorded twice.
p276/p276_278|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p276/p276_042|He is married with three children.
p276/p276_100|THE Farmer wants a new campaign.
p276/p276_092|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p276/p276_317|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p276/p276_272|was everything done to save people?
p276/p276_411|You will have seen the adverts.
p276/p276_223|It's been a humbling year.
p276/p276_364|He worked there for six months.
p276/p276_049|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p276/p276_333|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p276/p276_433|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p276/p276_416|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p276/p276_062|Everything is possible in football.
p276/p276_034|He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
p276/p276_255|Five years later, the deception continued.
p276/p276_162|A good actor doesn't think.
p276/p276_261|Mr Blair had done well.
p276/p276_112|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p276/p276_408|It has to be enforced.
p276/p276_303|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p276/p276_451|When I was four years old I used to do like this.
p276/p276_114|It is sometimes like that.
p276/p276_343|And we have the experience.
p276/p276_419|Everything has its place and purpose.
p276/p276_218|how do you get it back?
p276/p276_336|MOVIE stars are public property.
p276/p276_107|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p276/p276_385|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p276/p276_362|Walker plans to return indoors.
p276/p276_269|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p276/p276_459|There's not much money in cycling.
p276/p276_097|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p276/p276_244|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p276/p276_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p276/p276_398|That remains the unanswered question.
p276/p276_067|Then they scored two goals to win.
p276/p276_305|A winter of discontent awaits.
p276/p276_113|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p276/p276_248|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p276/p276_138|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p276/p276_391|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p276/p276_207|That is an entirely unacceptable position.
p276/p276_090|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p276/p276_276|Did he trip?
p276/p276_392|They would have to go to the Royal.
p276/p276_178|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p276/p276_434|The company declined to comment.
p276/p276_431|We have no information on Iraq.
p276/p276_069|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p276/p276_340|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p276/p276_377|Instead, he missed the lot.
p276/p276_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p276/p276_188|She is in good spirits.
p276/p276_397|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p276/p276_435|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p276/p276_087|Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
p276/p276_081|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p276/p276_125|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p276/p276_035|There was a rush of water.
p276/p276_250|I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
p276/p276_279|This is absolutely not true.
p276/p276_204|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p276/p276_054|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p276/p276_274|Do I think about them often?
p276/p276_195|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p276/p276_077|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p276/p276_109|Even the one she loved.
p276/p276_399|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p276/p276_430|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p276/p276_262|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p276/p276_150|Are you going to win?
p276/p276_146|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p276/p276_033|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p276/p276_101|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p276/p276_453|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p276/p276_099|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p276/p276_354|They make a selective perception process.
p276/p276_281|They should stop the bombing.
p276/p276_163|That's what happened against Ayr.
p276/p276_055|This represents a tough game for us.
p276/p276_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p276/p276_289|It's as eventful as it is momentous.
p276/p276_166|It is a good lifestyle.
p276/p276_444|I might also completely change the routine.
p334/p334_203|The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
p334/p334_232|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p334/p334_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p334/p334_419|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p334/p334_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p334/p334_368|As a nation, we must become more active.
p334/p334_362|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p334/p334_242|A venue was found.
p334/p334_326|The law should be changed.
p334/p334_126|It is a time bomb.
p334/p334_414|We are here for the long term.
p334/p334_209|It is the stop-gap before extinction.
p334/p334_117|He told the conference.
p334/p334_413|The hangover was Olympian.
p334/p334_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p334/p334_164|That's as it should be.
p334/p334_155|And therein lies the whole problem.
p334/p334_401|And they all had these other commitments.
p334/p334_291|We haven't actually considered it down here.
p334/p334_072|We are looking for volunteers.
p334/p334_400|The track is currently covered in snow.
p334/p334_288|It's the taking part that counts.
p334/p334_421|I think it is totally wrong.
p334/p334_216|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p334/p334_320|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p334/p334_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p334/p334_297|We have been extremely lucky this time.
p334/p334_177|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p334/p334_407|My wife and family are the support system.
p334/p334_222|The list is too long for this piece.
p334/p334_371|January is a bad time of year.
p334/p334_211|My friends were very envious.
p334/p334_343|He's a key player in Scotland.
p334/p334_122|It may now be too expensive for anyone.
p334/p334_110|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p334/p334_077|They follow him everywhere.
p334/p334_100|Justice was not seen today.
p334/p334_244|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p334/p334_252|The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
p334/p334_387|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p334/p334_278|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p334/p334_080|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p334/p334_143|Our offer will remain on the table.
p334/p334_135|I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
p334/p334_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p334/p334_255|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p334/p334_378|Here we have not had one hour.
p334/p334_033|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p334/p334_136|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p334/p334_060|Or so everyone believed.
p334/p334_404|We are going to change our party.
p334/p334_174|Do yourselves a favour.
p334/p334_202|We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
p334/p334_193|It is in our own hands.
p334/p334_087|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p334/p334_329|I will be standing.
p334/p334_277|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p334/p334_342|I knew he was dying.
p334/p334_409|The Master was by then just too old.
p334/p334_167|He looked very sharp.
p334/p334_349|People acted too quickly.
p334/p334_351|We took the chances when they came.
p334/p334_358|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p334/p334_076|I was inspired by two things.
p334/p334_354|Ferguson should take note.
p334/p334_318|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p334/p334_118|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p334/p334_043|The offer of help is there for anyone.
p334/p334_181|I disagree entirely with the decision.
p334/p334_106|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p334/p334_336|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p334/p334_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p334/p334_035|Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
p334/p334_131|It was just an accident of birth.
p334/p334_120|He also received a medal of honour.
p334/p334_112|It didn't take long.
p334/p334_422|It's not realistic because it's early days.
p334/p334_240|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p334/p334_272|She'd gone to the Catholic school.
p334/p334_370|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p334/p334_323|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p334/p334_231|He is adamant that he is innocent.
p334/p334_314|No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
p334/p334_204|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p334/p334_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p334/p334_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p334/p334_305|He is a Satan.
p334/p334_325|It was a UK-wide report.
p334/p334_089|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p334/p334_390|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p334/p334_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p334/p334_386|This fight is not going to go away.
p334/p334_353|What would you do if you didn't work?
p334/p334_397|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p334/p334_234|He took my breath away.
p334/p334_214|The approval system will be changed.
p334/p334_144|The world is split into two.
p334/p334_279|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p334/p334_109|We have it on video.
p334/p334_099|They chose to side with terror.
p334/p334_168|The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
p334/p334_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p334/p334_299|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p334/p334_359|It gave no further details.
p334/p334_092|We already have them, all over Europe.
p334/p334_103|We should just say no.
p334/p334_070|He will need that machine.
p334/p334_317|It seems a little short to me.
p334/p334_360|This man is serious about his work.
p334/p334_311|The whole nation will be delighted.
p334/p334_212|But who cares?
p334/p334_219|You just have to accept.
p334/p334_188|No finals are to be contested today.
p334/p334_241|It had won an investors in people award.
p334/p334_133|It was a simple question.
p334/p334_160|That is not just my personal view.
p334/p334_249|That's why they go to the opera.
p334/p334_081|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p334/p334_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p334/p334_259|I am getting long in the tooth.
p334/p334_094|Libya is an easy target.
p334/p334_253|I'm getting back up there now.
p334/p334_114|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p334/p334_063|Tomorrow night is the important game.
p334/p334_295|We were given a warm and friendly reception.
p334/p334_230|So far they have refused.
p334/p334_338|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p334/p334_281|They'll have to pay more.
p334/p334_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p334/p334_331|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p334/p334_097|It means they actually control the programme.
p334/p334_262|That, he claimed, was essential.
p334/p334_037|Darrell was, however, adamant.
p334/p334_247|So, the question is, is it any good?
p334/p334_420|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p334/p334_001|Please call Stella.
p334/p334_399|I'd never seen a play about me.
p334/p334_363|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p334/p334_025|A judicial review is also being considered.
p334/p334_032|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p334/p334_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p334/p334_083|This must be really short of ideas.
p334/p334_313|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p334/p334_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p334/p334_190|That night was a terrible muddle.
p334/p334_034|Appointed general secretary last September.
p334/p334_027|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p334/p334_079|Maybe that was the whole point.
p334/p334_148|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p334/p334_186|Thirteen people will be made redundant.
p334/p334_345|She wondered why we were interested.
p334/p334_257|They are there to get people into work.
p334/p334_254|Check that he is dead.
p334/p334_406|This seems like a very good idea.
p334/p334_175|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p334/p334_050|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p334/p334_235|It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
p334/p334_161|The investment will be in the food.
p334/p334_073|I had a sense of deja vu.
p334/p334_389|Would you take them?
p334/p334_260|They would be wise to do just that.
p334/p334_327|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p334/p334_095|I thought they played very well.
p334/p334_217|That period was a struggle.
p334/p334_284|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p334/p334_391|Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
p334/p334_334|The plot is simple.
p334/p334_238|I never wanted a legal battle.
p334/p334_237|After that it is up to the boss.
p334/p334_138|Could you put it in writing?
p334/p334_372|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p334/p334_064|He's very good at relating to adults.
p334/p334_300|It's a sign of the times.
p334/p334_335|They've not let anyone into the loop.
p334/p334_218|We are determined to establish the facts.
p334/p334_041|It was an accounting error.
p334/p334_286|The Open champion is back.
p334/p334_289|They married in August last year.
p334/p334_129|We are taking advice on this.
p334/p334_088|They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
p334/p334_104|We are not out of touch with politics.
p334/p334_346|The story was being repeated across Scotland.
p334/p334_274|You can't go back and change things.
p334/p334_285|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p334/p334_142|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p334/p334_341|Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
p334/p334_141|And that's good news for the magpies.
p334/p334_192|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p334/p334_276|This is a lie.
p334/p334_402|The report is due out next month.
p334/p334_265|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p334/p334_166|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p334/p334_170|We have taken steps to rectify it.
p334/p334_139|This is the New Edinburgh.
p334/p334_061|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p334/p334_078|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p334/p334_384|His death was a tragic accident.
p334/p334_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p334/p334_236|I will have to order its destruction.
p334/p334_115|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p334/p334_388|I just don't know where he is.
p334/p334_375|This is a huge boost for my confidence.
p334/p334_256|My players have no idea about football.
p334/p334_405|It's the same as Glasgow.
p334/p334_107|I didn't make those adjustments.
p334/p334_316|There are two games to go after that.
p334/p334_196|He will address the nation this evening.
p334/p334_028|I'd just like to play.
p334/p334_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p334/p334_226|Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
p334/p334_086|We have the easy part.
p334/p334_328|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p334/p334_036|We could feel the heat.
p334/p334_205|They serve a multitude of purposes.
p334/p334_113|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p334/p334_124|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p334/p334_398|I'm sure they love it.
p334/p334_191|His English counterpart agreed.
p334/p334_194|This is a step backwards.
p334/p334_269|I would recommend it.
p334/p334_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p334/p334_159|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p334/p334_296|He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
p334/p334_042|I had enough on.
p334/p334_333|The attack was totally unprovoked.
p334/p334_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p334/p334_224|I can't blame the fans.
p334/p334_096|It was a foolhardy decision.
p334/p334_395|His condition was stable last night.
p334/p334_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p334/p334_045|And we're not there yet.
p334/p334_198|I'm not changing my mind.
p334/p334_154|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p334/p334_298|People are fed up.
p334/p334_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p334/p334_156|He was not deterred.
p334/p334_250|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p334/p334_197|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p334/p334_030|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p334/p334_208|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p334/p334_105|That was a gold medal for certain.
p334/p334_302|I just need a bit of luck.
p334/p334_319|It's ahead of Labour.
p334/p334_183|That is his attitude to things.
p334/p334_292|You've been a great audience.
p334/p334_377|His third goal was superb.
p334/p334_379|He said to me, Which one, son?
p334/p334_339|Last night was a key episode.
p334/p334_082|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p334/p334_275|We are on a four-year mission.
p334/p334_046|No meaningful response was issued.
p334/p334_303|Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
p334/p334_091|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p334/p334_357|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p334/p334_207|The frustration was showing.
p334/p334_185|And what was that like, as an experience?
p334/p334_054|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p334/p334_246|He was to get his chance.
p334/p334_424|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p334/p334_245|Is that Titanic?
p334/p334_382|I was so nervous.
p334/p334_210|You have obviously got an answer to it.
p334/p334_418|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p334/p334_128|This could be a recipe for conflict.
p334/p334_189|This is not a struggle against Islam.
p334/p334_307|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p334/p334_147|It was so physical.
p334/p334_199|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p334/p334_283|Does it, Noel?
p334/p334_044|There were no passengers on board.
p334/p334_381|His son is a local legend.
p334/p334_165|It does seem a mystery.
p334/p334_215|So the European elections are extremely important.
p334/p334_306|I always felt they played for me.
p334/p334_151|It is extremely sad.
p334/p334_266|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p334/p334_282|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p334/p334_273|Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
p334/p334_412|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p334/p334_322|Then it developed into civil and criminal.
p334/p334_410|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p334/p334_263|I would like Glasgow.
p334/p334_411|He added, We are not prepared for war.
p334/p334_264|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p334/p334_157|This commitment should be built upon.
p334/p334_179|He was just like a godfather to it.
p334/p334_040|I wanted to win so badly.
p334/p334_396|The sun is worth a million dollars.
p334/p334_310|However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
p334/p334_132|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p334/p334_031|It was no surprise.
p334/p334_365|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p334/p334_178|What do they do, anyway?
p334/p334_315|The hotel was now for sale.
p334/p334_301|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p334/p334_162|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p334/p334_376|I'm delighted for Simon.
p334/p334_392|He would take up the bike.
p334/p334_051|Later we discovered it was a hoax.
p334/p334_180|I'd love to be like Peter.
p334/p334_111|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p334/p334_220|We must improve our relations with government.
p334/p334_233|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p334/p334_172|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p334/p334_026|I want to win this thing.
p334/p334_374|They are a very powerful and tasty side.
p334/p334_184|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p334/p334_069|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p334/p334_417|Some things in life you have to accept.
p334/p334_385|It's to do with context.
p334/p334_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p334/p334_304|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p334/p334_200|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p334/p334_146|I would ask the fans to be patient.
p334/p334_373|Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
p334/p334_280|They should stop the bombing.
p334/p334_287|It's going to be a new challenge.
p334/p334_268|I may think about performing it.
p334/p334_119|We tend to come good at the end.
p334/p334_169|Two of the team became ill.
p334/p334_121|It's not one for the purist.
p334/p334_048|Times have changed, but have they improved?
p334/p334_369|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p334/p334_059|It was totally my fault.
p334/p334_195|We may make a short-term appointment.
p334/p334_029|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p334/p334_367|This was a chilling echo.
p334/p334_137|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p334/p334_332|Are you from the rugby?
p334/p334_098|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p334/p334_225|That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
p334/p334_084|It was extremely cold.
p334/p334_227|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p334/p334_243|They are not an item.
p334/p334_344|He loved his children.
p334/p334_108|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p334/p334_350|This, too, could provoke a risky business.
p334/p334_423|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p334/p334_340|What did we learn?
p334/p334_056|Why do it?
p334/p334_393|A world away from Rangers, you might say.
p334/p334_261|He was sentenced to seven years.
p334/p334_364|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p334/p334_068|It was a move which appealed to him.
p334/p334_213|The house was full of smoke.
p334/p334_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p334/p334_123|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p334/p334_071|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p334/p334_066|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p334/p334_352|You have to audition for jobs.
p334/p334_150|Why is that?
p334/p334_038|He was a member of the Tartan Army.
p334/p334_074|It was very personal and very intimate.
p334/p334_228|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p334/p334_085|They use them for everything.
p334/p334_101|I would never even consider it.
p334/p334_163|The problem is the pitch.
p334/p334_356|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p334/p334_158|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p334/p334_052|It is a form of physical exercise.
p334/p334_201|Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
p334/p334_039|I think it can count against you now.
p334/p334_380|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p334/p334_206|We'll have to work hard today.
p334/p334_408|It remains in public ownership.
p334/p334_355|We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
p334/p334_062|Perhaps we should do the same.
p334/p334_347|An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
p334/p334_065|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p334/p334_383|The attacker has been put in foster care.
p334/p334_267|The weaknesses are few.
p334/p334_187|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p334/p334_348|I am content with the silver.
p334/p334_049|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p334/p334_153|Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
p334/p334_258|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p334/p334_171|I see no need for change.
p334/p334_053|plays in dark blue.
p334/p334_366|We will miss him very much.
p334/p334_415|More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
p334/p334_290|I want to keep him.
p334/p334_116|If you're going to do it, do it right.
p334/p334_361|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p334/p334_176|But we have come under attack.
p334/p334_271|Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p334/p334_330|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p334/p334_173|But the Premiership is everything to us.
p334/p334_294|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p334/p334_145|They deserve a lot of credit.
p334/p334_149|He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
p334/p334_403|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p334/p334_058|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p334/p334_337|With actors it is slightly different.
p334/p334_067|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p334/p334_321|I welcome this new service.
p334/p334_047|And the funny thing is, they usually do.
p334/p334_134|Some of his family still live there.
p334/p334_324|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p334/p334_090|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p334/p334_308|They must be kept on the ground.
p334/p334_075|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p334/p334_182|Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
p334/p334_312|The public have been very supportive.
p334/p334_223|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p334/p334_055|It is something that we will put right.
p334/p334_394|He sat down at the piano.
p334/p334_140|We all thought we were going to die.
p334/p334_251|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p334/p334_416|A great deal has been achieved.
p334/p334_248|I'll always remember the horrible images.
p334/p334_293|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p334/p334_309|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p334/p334_093|There are a lot of unanswered questions.
p334/p334_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p334/p334_130|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p334/p334_221|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p334/p334_127|It's a matter of huge concern.
p334/p334_229|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p334/p334_102|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p334/p334_057|It could take three days.
p334/p334_270|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p334/p334_239|This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
p334/p334_125|There is bound to be a formal complaint.
p271/p271_033|This is the window.
p271/p271_279|They seem to get away with it.
p271/p271_250|It is hard won.
p271/p271_284|He looked very sharp.
p271/p271_170|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
p271/p271_434|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p271/p271_176|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p271/p271_423|Paris is not only young.
p271/p271_096|This one did.
p271/p271_202|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p271/p271_265|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p271/p271_248|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p271/p271_115|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p271/p271_427|I'm very grateful.
p271/p271_211|I don't want to use it.
p271/p271_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p271/p271_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p271/p271_326|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p271/p271_339|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p271/p271_444|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p271/p271_311|There is no excuse.
p271/p271_323|We are in the end game.
p271/p271_298|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p271/p271_233|At the time, he was a living legend.
p271/p271_038|Indeed, he does.
p271/p271_190|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p271/p271_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p271/p271_426|It was like someone had died.
p271/p271_083|He is driven.
p271/p271_219|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p271/p271_046|Is a drug dealer?
p271/p271_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p271/p271_283|We are a grandmother.
p271/p271_183|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p271/p271_139|I was dead.
p271/p271_419|It is legally binding.
p271/p271_379|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p271/p271_413|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p271/p271_409|The weekly average was three hours.
p271/p271_108|We have an election in eight days.
p271/p271_090|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p271/p271_412|He got his degree.
p271/p271_037|It was clear.
p271/p271_443|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p271/p271_383|Yet the data is compelling.
p271/p271_068|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p271/p271_401|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p271/p271_356|We will be homeless.
p271/p271_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p271/p271_271|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p271/p271_200|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p271/p271_318|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p271/p271_349|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p271/p271_362|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p271/p271_228|I will win.
p271/p271_133|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p271/p271_343|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p271/p271_303|They are wrong.
p271/p271_086|Someone who cares
p271/p271_342|went on sale.
p271/p271_123|Who would have?
p271/p271_281|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p271/p271_194|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p271/p271_436|The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
p271/p271_442|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p271/p271_071|Try to save us.
p271/p271_142|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p271/p271_294|This is a national crisis.
p271/p271_239|We are so proud.
p271/p271_137|My daughter is an adult.
p271/p271_042|We will push.
p271/p271_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p271/p271_172|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p271/p271_337|Who will do it?
p271/p271_100|They are now divorced.
p271/p271_116|It was the eighties.
p271/p271_424|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p271/p271_249|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p271/p271_197|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p271/p271_255|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p271/p271_348|We have big ideas.
p271/p271_158|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p271/p271_422|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p271/p271_417|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p271/p271_153|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p271/p271_399|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p271/p271_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p271/p271_074|It's all I can do.
p271/p271_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p271/p271_335|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p271/p271_119|You had better believe it.
p271/p271_036|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p271/p271_156|Work has started.
p271/p271_268|This is a question of Islam.
p271/p271_270|You take a risk.
p271/p271_416|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p271/p271_072|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p271/p271_414|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p271/p271_122|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p271/p271_386|Who will provide the wine?
p271/p271_332|Is that an issue?
p271/p271_329|It is a job creation scheme.
p271/p271_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p271/p271_245|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p271/p271_097|Then came the crunch.
p271/p271_048|He is too weak to move.
p271/p271_242|It's quite nice.
p271/p271_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p271/p271_148|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p271/p271_180|One season, they might do well.
p271/p271_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p271/p271_160|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p271/p271_126|The people will come.
p271/p271_394|But we are a young side.
p271/p271_361|And he laughs.
p271/p271_059|It is unique.
p271/p271_353|It is not like us.
p271/p271_236|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p271/p271_182|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p271/p271_091|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p271/p271_404|They are not left wing.
p271/p271_087|By then, he was walking on water.
p271/p271_300|Nothing is safe.
p271/p271_336|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p271/p271_258|That could be in place by next year.
p271/p271_384|It's a real problem.
p271/p271_372|There is no signature.
p271/p271_089|They lived for their children.
p271/p271_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p271/p271_217|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p271/p271_316|My whole life has changed.
p271/p271_376|The BBC was a disgrace.
p271/p271_257|The concerns are the same.
p271/p271_149|Note the date.
p271/p271_253|The scene is about this?
p271/p271_227|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p271/p271_322|They had a confession.
p271/p271_377|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p271/p271_201|I came home by ambulance.
p271/p271_389|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p271/p271_388|They deserved the win.
p271/p271_247|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p271/p271_061|That's the truth.
p271/p271_084|A play is a set of actions.
p271/p271_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p271/p271_188|I've been there.
p271/p271_099|It is home-grown.
p271/p271_263|This is the first step.
p271/p271_290|It was a virus.
p271/p271_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p271/p271_184|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p271/p271_328|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p271/p271_387|It is unusual.
p271/p271_338|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p271/p271_121|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p271/p271_331|Relief was beyond belief.
p271/p271_178|He was a crazy man.
p271/p271_154|The weather forecast isn't good.
p271/p271_421|The service from the other players was super.
p271/p271_078|Neither it is.
p271/p271_363|There was a substantial explosion.
p271/p271_405|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p271/p271_295|We are not going to forget.
p271/p271_120|It's not fair.
p271/p271_103|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p271/p271_315|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p271/p271_167|As, indeed, they would be.
p271/p271_432|I know the worry over Iraq.
p271/p271_238|They tried to give her advice.
p271/p271_454|It's a miracle.
p271/p271_056|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p271/p271_403|It is an absolute nonsense.
p271/p271_220|That idea is rubbish.
p271/p271_369|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p271/p271_065|It's that kind of place.
p271/p271_130|We work well together.
p271/p271_210|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p271/p271_067|It's good news and long overdue.
p271/p271_047|There is no reason at all.
p271/p271_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p271/p271_174|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p271/p271_327|There was no time scale.
p271/p271_073|He was at home with his pals.
p271/p271_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p271/p271_049|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p271/p271_140|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p271/p271_425|He is to appeal.
p271/p271_415|But we finished the show.
p271/p271_106|They make a selective perception process.
p271/p271_224|He seemed to lose his focus.
p271/p271_208|He had suffered a heart attack.
p271/p271_128|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p271/p271_109|He takes the job.
p271/p271_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p271/p271_321|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p271/p271_453|It had been in place since last July.
p271/p271_408|It might be.
p271/p271_045|Among them are many criminals.
p271/p271_179|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p271/p271_195|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p271/p271_132|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p271/p271_366|It has only been rumours.
p271/p271_216|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p271/p271_079|Is there a new way forward?
p271/p271_302|There is no openness.
p271/p271_345|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p271/p271_138|He should resign.
p271/p271_076|Then followed a bout of flu.
p271/p271_240|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p271/p271_225|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p271/p271_307|The court had a number of empty seats.
p271/p271_450|Was it worth it?
p271/p271_278|She failed in her action.
p271/p271_312|The letters are going out today.
p271/p271_053|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p271/p271_207|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p271/p271_296|No Briton has ever won.
p271/p271_431|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p271/p271_287|You feel very helpless.
p271/p271_305|This is a war over our home.
p271/p271_346|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p271/p271_313|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p271/p271_080|The party is up for it.
p271/p271_325|It's too horrible to think.
p271/p271_104|I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
p271/p271_231|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p271/p271_374|It became a national network.
p271/p271_173|We have a budget in March.
p271/p271_125|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p271/p271_181|As we worked.
p271/p271_370|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p271/p271_274|The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
p271/p271_141|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p271/p271_375|I am a wealthy person.
p271/p271_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p271/p271_380|That's the name of the game, though.
p271/p271_289|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p271/p271_360|It is a memorial.
p271/p271_365|Their time has gone.
p271/p271_135|It was very frightened and dirty.
p271/p271_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p271/p271_110|She reflects a bit.
p271/p271_044|They said she was stable.
p271/p271_398|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p271/p271_309|The plot is minimal.
p271/p271_320|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p271/p271_441|We were used.
p271/p271_187|The goals were good.
p271/p271_129|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p271/p271_440|In it went.
p271/p271_438|Admission is free.
p271/p271_262|Is that a serious question?
p271/p271_341|This is a big advantage.
p271/p271_041|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p271/p271_430|There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
p271/p271_402|He will be judged by his actions.
p271/p271_050|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p271/p271_347|I got a yellow card.
p271/p271_165|It has to be now.
p271/p271_407|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p271/p271_185|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p271/p271_221|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p271/p271_171|Tell it like it was?
p271/p271_147|I was awful.
p271/p271_252|You can feel at home in China.
p271/p271_093|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p271/p271_031|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p271/p271_066|They are real.
p271/p271_043|I hate the word.
p271/p271_256|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p271/p271_291|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p271/p271_373|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p271/p271_161|That includes the equipment?
p271/p271_209|It was worth a photograph.
p271/p271_299|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p271/p271_232|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p271/p271_169|They are not advertised.
p271/p271_150|So I got a blood test.
p271/p271_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p271/p271_177|It is really good news.
p271/p271_235|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p271/p271_136|Is that it?
p271/p271_060|I expect a rapid response.
p271/p271_390|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p271/p271_196|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p271/p271_159|Words were not required.
p271/p271_400|It is full-scale.
p271/p271_437|We are all equal.
p271/p271_439|We are now up against it.
p271/p271_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p271/p271_107|That would be unlawful.
p271/p271_354|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p271/p271_062|Jobs could go.
p271/p271_094|He was possessed
p271/p271_166|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p271/p271_429|We have the location, which is assured.
p271/p271_368|The death rates are still as high.
p271/p271_448|We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
p271/p271_118|It is so sad.
p271/p271_357|That would help.
p271/p271_198|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p271/p271_277|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p271/p271_261|Chelsea was a great club.
p271/p271_446|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p271/p271_146|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p271/p271_214|It had all been arranged.
p271/p271_285|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p271/p271_206|Tommy is not a problem.
p271/p271_259|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p271/p271_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p271/p271_112|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p271/p271_385|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p271/p271_334|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p271/p271_164|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p271/p271_381|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p271/p271_293|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p271/p271_304|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p271/p271_308|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p271/p271_449|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p271/p271_175|You had to go and see him.
p271/p271_393|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p271/p271_075|There could be a way back.
p271/p271_114|I am an actor.
p271/p271_351|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p271/p271_035|We speak about the performance.
p271/p271_032|I'd just like to play.
p271/p271_215|I had decided to quit the show.
p271/p271_057|I love the Dome.
p271/p271_113|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p271/p271_131|What will happen then?
p271/p271_344|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p271/p271_222|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p271/p271_088|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p271/p271_070|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p271/p271_152|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p271/p271_001|Please call Stella.
p271/p271_151|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p271/p271_244|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p271/p271_117|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p271/p271_234|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p271/p271_077|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p271/p271_029|They have no history.
p271/p271_314|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p271/p271_260|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p271/p271_064|Scotland had great assets.
p271/p271_081|Even the one she loved.
p271/p271_105|It is a love affair.
p271/p271_168|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p271/p271_410|He scored a touchdown.
p271/p271_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p271/p271_340|I've got no secret.
p271/p271_127|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p271/p271_280|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p271/p271_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p271/p271_418|That may be.
p271/p271_040|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p271/p271_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p271/p271_275|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p271/p271_391|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p271/p271_157|My Dad is a hero.
p271/p271_191|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p271/p271_297|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p271/p271_241|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p271/p271_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p271/p271_055|I was inspired by two things.
p271/p271_276|That goes back a long way.
p271/p271_266|Blood samples were taken.
p271/p271_052|Here's a clue.
p271/p271_433|Everything has collapsed.
p271/p271_193|One was a lawyer.
p271/p271_163|I'd love to be like Peter.
p271/p271_396|It will take place in July.
p271/p271_111|The cause of the fire is not yet known.
p271/p271_237|We were awful.
p271/p271_058|It's so awful.
p271/p271_251|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p271/p271_192|What has caused the demise of singing?
p271/p271_272|He was also married with two children.
p271/p271_162|These days are long gone.
p271/p271_358|My husband was angry.
p271/p271_350|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p271/p271_223|We could easily be cut again.
p271/p271_243|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p271/p271_269|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p271/p271_144|She died at her home.
p271/p271_352|Until they came to do it.
p271/p271_246|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p271/p271_333|They should take their mobile phones.
p271/p271_447|Bill is a mentor.
p271/p271_034|I feel I did not have enough time.
p271/p271_203|It opened last month.
p271/p271_364|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p271/p271_397|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p271/p271_054|I guess I was lucky, though.
p271/p271_101|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p271/p271_092|It is a lifeline.
p271/p271_451|It was ignored.
p271/p271_392|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p271/p271_226|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p271/p271_355|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p271/p271_186|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p271/p271_229|I am immensely sad.
p271/p271_359|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p271/p271_218|I might come back.
p271/p271_282|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p271/p271_102|I saw the whole thing.
p271/p271_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p271/p271_082|He is in the queue.
p271/p271_445|They were not even allowed to see them.
p271/p271_212|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p271/p271_205|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p271/p271_254|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p271/p271_145|He realises his mistake.
p271/p271_395|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p271/p271_378|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p271/p271_367|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p271/p271_143|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p271/p271_069|We should have known.
p271/p271_199|It is a farce.
p271/p271_267|We shall rely on human beings.
p271/p271_420|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p271/p271_452|It is bizarre.
p271/p271_288|You've got to have both sides.
p271/p271_292|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p271/p271_317|We are a peaceful people.
p271/p271_155|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p271/p271_330|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p271/p271_301|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p271/p271_406|In a way he was.
p271/p271_264|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p271/p271_039|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p271/p271_428|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p271/p271_306|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p271/p271_435|It is not either national standards or local control.
p271/p271_230|It's not before time.
p271/p271_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p271/p271_371|It seems a long time ago.
p271/p271_324|It will work.
p271/p271_319|Henman has been warned.
p271/p271_204|We believe a third party was involved.
p271/p271_134|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p271/p271_085|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p271/p271_025|She looked so young.
p271/p271_286|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p271/p271_382|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p271/p271_095|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p271/p271_098|It is annoying.
p271/p271_411|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p271/p271_310|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p271/p271_063|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p271/p271_124|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p271/p271_213|You have a plan?
p271/p271_189|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p271/p271_051|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p278/p278_280|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p278/p278_313|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p278/p278_401|They know it'll be fantastic.
p278/p278_079|Mr Smith declined to comment.
p278/p278_124|This is a frightening development.
p278/p278_049|He will need that machine.
p278/p278_405|We must improve our relations with government.
p278/p278_242|This would include the GM food industry.
p278/p278_219|It was important to win the singles.
p278/p278_249|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p278/p278_398|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p278/p278_281|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p278/p278_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p278/p278_238|I have spoken to the skipper.
p278/p278_269|We accept the new rules.
p278/p278_164|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p278/p278_214|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p278/p278_366|We put our bid in last night.
p278/p278_151|Nothing was meant by it.
p278/p278_315|You have to see it like this.
p278/p278_390|The team hadn't been picked.
p278/p278_276|They are interior designers and architects.
p278/p278_191|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p278/p278_101|So what is the campaign about?
p278/p278_339|We want to play at the worlds.
p278/p278_271|was everything done to save people?
p278/p278_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p278/p278_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p278/p278_109|The music industry hasn't changed at all.
p278/p278_371|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p278/p278_155|I knew he was good.
p278/p278_043|Must be prepared to use it.
p278/p278_108|We have got a race.
p278/p278_047|So is that it, then?
p278/p278_115|It was located on the remote control.
p278/p278_125|Which can happen any time.
p278/p278_387|This remains the party's policy.
p278/p278_067|The fans would love it.
p278/p278_282|These figures are truly terrible.
p278/p278_073|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p278/p278_375|He must have seen the movie.
p278/p278_292|It has become a way of life.
p278/p278_134|You've got to be vigilant.
p278/p278_142|Anyone can do the sums.
p278/p278_328|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p278/p278_309|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p278/p278_114|I didn't think so either.
p278/p278_243|My wife and family are the support system.
p278/p278_041|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p278/p278_187|Says the Duke of York.
p278/p278_347|And he is immensely loyal.
p278/p278_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p278/p278_297|This is a great opportunity for us.
p278/p278_072|It's all going to clear the debt.
p278/p278_295|It was never a free kick.
p278/p278_233|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p278/p278_030|The director will be present.
p278/p278_148|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p278/p278_245|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p278/p278_393|The marshall at the turn was great.
p278/p278_106|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p278/p278_409|The next few months will tell.
p278/p278_368|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p278/p278_290|I understand the security issue.
p278/p278_186|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p278/p278_334|That meant the search was unlawful.
p278/p278_055|We have not given up hope.
p278/p278_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p278/p278_178|I always felt they played for me.
p278/p278_306|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p278/p278_341|How independent is that?
p278/p278_131|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p278/p278_382|How do you take them away?
p278/p278_320|It's unlikely to be renewed.
p278/p278_301|So the Government will be damaged.
p278/p278_218|They have known the hard times.
p278/p278_391|One-third of the places are already taken.
p278/p278_056|She said she was really sorry.
p278/p278_045|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p278/p278_210|I won't make an official complaint.
p278/p278_361|But we welcome this document.
p278/p278_358|A crucial moment has arrived.
p278/p278_278|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p278/p278_167|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p278/p278_258|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p278/p278_410|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p278/p278_268|It is not enough to be first division champions.
p278/p278_397|It has happened for generations.
p278/p278_174|Are you going to win?
p278/p278_031|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p278/p278_196|It caused a lot of upset.
p278/p278_237|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p278/p278_160|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p278/p278_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p278/p278_136|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p278/p278_346|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p278/p278_288|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p278/p278_205|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p278/p278_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p278/p278_240|The statement contained no surprises.
p278/p278_337|We are on a four-year mission.
p278/p278_077|We have to offer value for money.
p278/p278_353|My view has now completely changed.
p278/p278_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p278/p278_135|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p278/p278_275|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p278/p278_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p278/p278_050|I have learned from him.
p278/p278_185|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p278/p278_251|There were no reports of casualties.
p278/p278_176|Why change it?
p278/p278_163|It's never great to finish second.
p278/p278_044|He looks like an Afghan.
p278/p278_070|Even the one she loved.
p278/p278_105|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p278/p278_224|Twaddle is a case in point.
p278/p278_293|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p278/p278_356|Finally came the moment of truth.
p278/p278_097|Our house was very small.
p278/p278_086|It was clear on Thursday.
p278/p278_099|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p278/p278_143|Others are not so sure.
p278/p278_120|You can spend money on housing.
p278/p278_063|I'm looking to the future.
p278/p278_116|Maybe this battle has been.
p278/p278_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p278/p278_172|My life has been destroyed.
p278/p278_209|I am very realistic about these things.
p278/p278_274|Is it in the right place?
p278/p278_153|Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
p278/p278_076|By then, he was walking on water.
p278/p278_326|McNaughton was not so sure.
p278/p278_374|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p278/p278_336|That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
p278/p278_308|He will address the nation this evening.
p278/p278_406|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p278/p278_199|Last night was a key episode.
p278/p278_042|Well, the climate has changed.
p278/p278_168|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
p278/p278_327|The dealer is on notice.
p278/p278_207|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p278/p278_057|None has ever been found.
p278/p278_227|Does the name matter?
p278/p278_304|John was there already in spirit.
p278/p278_364|He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
p278/p278_028|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p278/p278_349|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p278/p278_234|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p278/p278_381|Does it matter?
p278/p278_354|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p278/p278_298|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p278/p278_363|His views are hardly surprising.
p278/p278_291|Truth is the child of time.
p278/p278_051|I had trouble with the producers.
p278/p278_129|This should begin in October.
p278/p278_192|They were seriously after him.
p278/p278_088|But they must believe in themselves.
p278/p278_379|This decision is a farce.
p278/p278_171|We've made a couple of albums.
p278/p278_325|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p278/p278_130|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p278/p278_263|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p278/p278_253|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p278/p278_305|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p278/p278_121|The hearing was due to continue today.
p278/p278_111|He was jailed for a year.
p278/p278_307|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p278/p278_403|Clark is back on top form.
p278/p278_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p278/p278_202|I came home by ambulance.
p278/p278_190|I've always been like that.
p278/p278_113|Football is a passion for many.
p278/p278_259|You can feel at home in China.
p278/p278_352|Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
p278/p278_239|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p278/p278_220|The only problem was the greens.
p278/p278_215|They make a selective perception process.
p278/p278_235|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p278/p278_158|These days are long gone.
p278/p278_311|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p278/p278_303|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p278/p278_102|And does it?
p278/p278_343|What are they for?
p278/p278_156|We will turn the corner.
p278/p278_193|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p278/p278_144|I have always loved the countryside.
p278/p278_197|However, this idea is never developed.
p278/p278_244|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p278/p278_098|Why do it otherwise?
p278/p278_203|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p278/p278_216|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p278/p278_231|Who was she?
p278/p278_241|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p278/p278_264|I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
p278/p278_091|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p278/p278_340|Do you think we are a top nation?
p278/p278_267|Messages have to be reinforced.
p278/p278_392|I always knew she was funny.
p278/p278_310|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p278/p278_183|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p278/p278_059|The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
p278/p278_221|January is a bad time of year.
p278/p278_213|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p278/p278_065|The judge was really nice.
p278/p278_211|He is a good signing for Rangers.
p278/p278_066|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p278/p278_236|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p278/p278_386|In due course the deal was done.
p278/p278_182|The outcome is now in our own hands.
p278/p278_074|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p278/p278_256|It seems a waste of talents.
p278/p278_389|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p278/p278_166|He is keen to stay in public service.
p278/p278_321|I first met him last summer.
p278/p278_226|My daughter is an adult.
p278/p278_376|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p278/p278_365|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p278/p278_141|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p278/p278_360|Three years ago he would have been.
p278/p278_317|Holland won by five wickets.
p278/p278_147|There's always the next century.
p278/p278_331|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p278/p278_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p278/p278_103|Are you from the rugby?
p278/p278_223|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p278/p278_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p278/p278_362|It intends to do so on Wednesday.
p278/p278_062|Only water is currently allowed.
p278/p278_394|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p278/p278_139|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p278/p278_323|The casting is as perfect.
p278/p278_119|Ferguson will be a millionaire.
p278/p278_228|how do you get it back?
p278/p278_053|People come to see the Highlands.
p278/p278_200|They are still very quiet.
p278/p278_332|Much the same thing happens in a young company.
p278/p278_104|Had I heard?
p278/p278_350|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p278/p278_294|Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
p278/p278_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p278/p278_173|What happened in that game?
p278/p278_084|Everyone had to play the game.
p278/p278_061|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p278/p278_094|In the end we made too many errors.
p278/p278_272|What was the matter for concern?
p278/p278_133|That would open the gates of hell.
p278/p278_152|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p278/p278_194|It shows the strength of the roots.
p278/p278_154|It was by the numbers.
p278/p278_402|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p278/p278_052|He also presented You Bet!
p278/p278_369|I was delighted to accept.
p278/p278_277|He was released after treatment.
p278/p278_377|The major championships will always have a special place.
p278/p278_026|These decisions are not simple.
p278/p278_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p278/p278_380|Is it worth it?
p278/p278_082|He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
p278/p278_069|The party is up for it.
p278/p278_299|You have to expect this type of thing.
p278/p278_372|The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
p278/p278_355|He was at school in Devon.
p278/p278_373|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p278/p278_262|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p278/p278_150|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
p278/p278_255|They made such decisions in London.
p278/p278_046|How are you, sir?
p278/p278_222|His injury was completely random.
p278/p278_201|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p278/p278_229|What are you not good at?
p278/p278_095|That time is not now, however.
p278/p278_161|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p278/p278_126|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p278/p278_078|It's so hard to shift.
p278/p278_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p278/p278_075|Petrol prices were widely blamed.
p278/p278_289|Those overseas offices were great.
p278/p278_404|I had a fortunate war.
p278/p278_330|The party lasted all night.
p278/p278_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p278/p278_184|It is vital to clarify their role.
p278/p278_254|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p278/p278_250|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p278/p278_085|It was worth a photograph.
p278/p278_037|It was a hell of a way to lose.
p278/p278_318|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p278/p278_165|We have a budget in March.
p278/p278_035|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p278/p278_316|You have asked for action.
p278/p278_348|It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
p278/p278_032|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p278/p278_064|But it has been an amazing experience.
p278/p278_127|We had another last Tuesday.
p278/p278_252|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p278/p278_128|I didn't feel under any pressure.
p278/p278_232|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p278/p278_287|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p278/p278_378|That is a break with tradition.
p278/p278_388|They will fight for everything.
p278/p278_140|They could use a boost.
p278/p278_357|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p278/p278_100|So, did she meet him?
p278/p278_027|Life was like a timetable.
p278/p278_157|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p278/p278_329|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p278/p278_048|Do I have a favourite?
p278/p278_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p278/p278_087|It's not a holiday time for football players.
p278/p278_260|We have no information on Iraq.
p278/p278_225|I'm just a regular person.
p278/p278_181|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p278/p278_246|I need a publishing deal!
p278/p278_399|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p278/p278_169|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p278/p278_146|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p278/p278_261|Persuaded to change his mind.
p278/p278_324|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p278/p278_385|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p278/p278_351|And it was this one.
p278/p278_029|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p278/p278_312|It's not covered by the insurance.
p278/p278_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p278/p278_266|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p278/p278_117|That might help a bit.
p278/p278_408|That is the ultimate revenge.
p278/p278_342|What form did that take?
p278/p278_395|They have not got anyone.
p278/p278_118|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p278/p278_145|It was his job to check.
p278/p278_137|Before it was an ordeal.
p278/p278_344|Is there a waiting list?
p278/p278_230|I think, therefore I am?
p278/p278_283|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p278/p278_054|They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
p278/p278_110|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p278/p278_370|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p278/p278_132|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p278/p278_206|We could soon be in that same position!
p278/p278_204|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p278/p278_208|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p278/p278_319|The answer was in space.
p278/p278_112|They almost achieved a draw.
p278/p278_159|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p278/p278_400|There's still no-one like him.
p278/p278_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p278/p278_034|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p278/p278_296|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p278/p278_175|Was it the wife?
p278/p278_359|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p278/p278_302|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p278/p278_093|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p278/p278_286|I'd like to report a murder.
p278/p278_335|And he goes with it.
p278/p278_279|I'd never run for them.
p278/p278_314|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p278/p278_107|I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
p278/p278_180|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p278/p278_092|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p278/p278_162|So was the first half.
p278/p278_058|Let's hope that it does.
p278/p278_096|We created so many chances.
p278/p278_138|It will affect their work.
p278/p278_036|Several investments have already been made.
p278/p278_122|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p278/p278_396|The law would appear to be on our side.
p278/p278_040|This will get their attention.
p278/p278_188|That's not fair to the supporters.
p278/p278_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p278/p278_247|It had so much to do with output.
p278/p278_257|I was just getting over the time difference.
p278/p278_345|The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
p278/p278_273|Do I think about them often?
p278/p278_285|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p278/p278_270|And they were being paid?
p278/p278_083|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p278/p278_170|On my day I can beat anyone.
p278/p278_265|No production contract is yet in sight.
p278/p278_179|His team management was protective.
p278/p278_081|That was a great performance by the team.
p278/p278_198|I had come back from London.
p278/p278_033|It carried a double message.
p278/p278_123|However, the problem is the timing.
p278/p278_068|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p278/p278_284|The stage was set for a showdown.
p278/p278_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p278/p278_248|A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
p278/p278_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p278/p278_195|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p278/p278_333|They come to enjoy themselves.
p278/p278_300|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p278/p278_080|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p278/p278_038|Among them are many criminals.
p278/p278_177|What do we want to do that for?
p278/p278_367|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p278/p278_322|The songs are just so good.
p278/p278_384|After the match, do you?
p278/p278_089|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p278/p278_060|It was exactly four months away.
p278/p278_407|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p278/p278_189|They need to look after themselves.
p278/p278_090|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p278/p278_338|The letters are going out today.
p278/p278_217|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p278/p278_039|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p278/p278_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p278/p278_383|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p278/p278_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p278/p278_212|Bombing is the easy option.
p278/p278_071|It was a unanimous decision.
p251/p251_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p251/p251_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p251/p251_314|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p251/p251_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p251/p251_082|You will be.
p251/p251_331|They had a confession.
p251/p251_253|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p251/p251_252|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p251/p251_206|A deadline is still essential.
p251/p251_333|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p251/p251_063|It was all in a short period of time.
p251/p251_036|Was it worth it?
p251/p251_216|Twaddle is a case in point.
p251/p251_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p251/p251_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p251/p251_337|It's not long enough.
p251/p251_176|It is not either national standards or local control.
p251/p251_081|War is not the action.
p251/p251_094|If you could find it.
p251/p251_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p251/p251_208|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p251/p251_179|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p251/p251_026|But it failed.
p251/p251_032|It's a matter of balance.
p251/p251_117|Does this mean.
p251/p251_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p251/p251_235|I'd never seen a play about me.
p251/p251_193|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p251/p251_169|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p251/p251_350|He did a good job.
p251/p251_048|As she explains.
p251/p251_141|Three penalties were given.
p251/p251_340|The police have to act to help them.
p251/p251_133|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p251/p251_160|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p251/p251_119|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p251/p251_228|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p251/p251_149|You know the type.
p251/p251_087|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p251/p251_236|It is a gamble.
p251/p251_248|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p251/p251_349|The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
p251/p251_189|People will ask about us.
p251/p251_344|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p251/p251_112|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p251/p251_173|One season, they might do well.
p251/p251_316|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p251/p251_323|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p251/p251_077|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p251/p251_369|That would help.
p251/p251_168|The post will be unpaid.
p251/p251_102|That is no use.
p251/p251_135|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p251/p251_027|That's no bad thing.
p251/p251_210|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p251/p251_195|It is a case of taking a risk.
p251/p251_269|Kirkwood was arrested.
p251/p251_360|They got upset.
p251/p251_280|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p251/p251_274|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p251/p251_244|They should come forward.
p251/p251_288|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p251/p251_270|they fail to engage.
p251/p251_033|Peace was won.
p251/p251_184|What has caused the demise of singing?
p251/p251_111|The fire was above the hole.
p251/p251_099|That would be unlawful.
p251/p251_292|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p251/p251_335|There was no time scale.
p251/p251_298|People have no choice.
p251/p251_185|We want to help them through it.
p251/p251_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p251/p251_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p251/p251_180|We knew nothing about it.
p251/p251_362|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p251/p251_327|We are a peaceful people.
p251/p251_353|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p251/p251_282|That's the only thing I will say.
p251/p251_188|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p251/p251_157|There's a pause.
p251/p251_239|We were awful.
p251/p251_366|However, it was well worth the wait.
p251/p251_187|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p251/p251_320|Our task is to complete the picture.
p251/p251_192|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p251/p251_118|It is rubbish.
p251/p251_321|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p251/p251_309|Who did the recruiting?
p251/p251_172|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p251/p251_326|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p251/p251_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p251/p251_243|It is set in Paris.
p251/p251_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p251/p251_301|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p251/p251_126|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p251/p251_286|He has not created a Festival resource.
p251/p251_065|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p251/p251_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p251/p251_056|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p251/p251_142|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p251/p251_284|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p251/p251_167|You are not going in blind.
p251/p251_318|He said she was mad.
p251/p251_315|A new school will be built.
p251/p251_211|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p251/p251_121|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p251/p251_199|It's the same old story.
p251/p251_075|Today she has been released.
p251/p251_197|It wasn't to be.
p251/p251_306|Who will perform?
p251/p251_374|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p251/p251_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p251/p251_151|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p251/p251_342|Is that an issue?
p251/p251_291|We're in shock.
p251/p251_304|You've got to have both sides.
p251/p251_057|What was the main difference?
p251/p251_266|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p251/p251_136|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p251/p251_134|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p251/p251_359|It is not like working for a living.
p251/p251_130|We had a reunion last week.
p251/p251_198|It was typical.
p251/p251_042|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p251/p251_299|She looked so young.
p251/p251_254|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p251/p251_074|I've not thought about it.
p251/p251_265|They know no other way.
p251/p251_324|You are the glory.
p251/p251_246|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p251/p251_219|We have got to get it right.
p251/p251_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p251/p251_297|I am an estate agent.
p251/p251_368|We will be homeless.
p251/p251_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p251/p251_097|They were outside the circle.
p251/p251_245|It's quite a line-up!
p251/p251_328|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p251/p251_182|Four policemen were wounded.
p251/p251_132|Government will intervene.
p251/p251_268|They are interior designers and architects.
p251/p251_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p251/p251_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p251/p251_338|I am so upset.
p251/p251_145|The songs are just so good.
p251/p251_137|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p251/p251_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p251/p251_154|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p251/p251_300|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p251/p251_069|There could be a way back.
p251/p251_085|We have turned the corner.
p251/p251_341|It could have gone either way.
p251/p251_039|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p251/p251_256|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p251/p251_251|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p251/p251_285|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p251/p251_200|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p251/p251_302|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p251/p251_058|Four other charges were dropped.
p251/p251_212|We have an election in eight days.
p251/p251_083|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p251/p251_214|There was an e-mail.
p251/p251_191|Last night was a key episode.
p251/p251_279|Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
p251/p251_190|However, this idea is never developed.
p251/p251_250|My future is in the marathon.
p251/p251_162|We have to move forward.
p251/p251_232|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p251/p251_295|It's a way of life.
p251/p251_143|We just had a go.
p251/p251_222|Work has started.
p251/p251_352|Well, it won't.
p251/p251_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p251/p251_177|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p251/p251_108|I came to complete.
p251/p251_264|We are ready.
p251/p251_147|That group reported just before Christmas.
p251/p251_209|Today was first class.
p251/p251_238|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p251/p251_116|I joined a group.
p251/p251_263|It was a hit.
p251/p251_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p251/p251_311|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p251/p251_170|They thought they had found a home.
p251/p251_260|His body was never found.
p251/p251_365|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p251/p251_343|He can do no wrong.
p251/p251_101|It is a good lifestyle.
p251/p251_351|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p251/p251_144|We have seen a copy of the report.
p251/p251_100|No date has been set for the appeal.
p251/p251_164|Tell it like it was?
p251/p251_165|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p251/p251_330|It is out there.
p251/p251_373|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p251/p251_303|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p251/p251_088|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p251/p251_336|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p251/p251_348|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p251/p251_114|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p251/p251_158|Neither side can win this war.
p251/p251_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p251/p251_308|Scotland were beaten again.
p251/p251_131|If not, a deal could take many months.
p251/p251_247|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p251/p251_213|Now, it's all right.
p251/p251_207|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p251/p251_262|He's a lovely young man.
p251/p251_115|Maybe this battle has been.
p251/p251_305|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p251/p251_113|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p251/p251_281|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p251/p251_347|The team for the first game could be this one.
p251/p251_271|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p251/p251_152|He seemed to lose his focus.
p251/p251_091|Until you hit the big games.
p251/p251_030|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p251/p251_329|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p251/p251_230|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p251/p251_076|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p251/p251_275|I am very angry.
p251/p251_064|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p251/p251_313|These figures are truly awful.
p251/p251_234|I am immensely sad.
p251/p251_319|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p251/p251_125|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p251/p251_196|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p251/p251_123|I'm so angry.
p251/p251_202|There was no option.
p251/p251_220|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p251/p251_345|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p251/p251_159|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p251/p251_095|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p251/p251_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p251/p251_217|I began to pray.
p251/p251_138|Is that it?
p251/p251_183|We did everything by the book.
p251/p251_361|I saw some good things.
p251/p251_071|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p251/p251_148|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p251/p251_223|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p251/p251_035|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p251/p251_067|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p251/p251_043|Dancing was her life.
p251/p251_047|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p251/p251_255|It is hard won.
p251/p251_037|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p251/p251_107|It had been played at festivals.
p251/p251_080|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p251/p251_203|The conference is the first test.
p251/p251_041|They may be wrong.
p251/p251_296|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p251/p251_174|The jury is still out.
p251/p251_128|Well, you can have a tree.
p251/p251_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p251/p251_155|I knew he was good.
p251/p251_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p251/p251_215|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p251/p251_044|We will push.
p251/p251_103|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p251/p251_317|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p251/p251_089|We must look forward.
p251/p251_227|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p251/p251_310|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p251/p251_140|I am totally devoted to this job.
p251/p251_194|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p251/p251_293|One knows the feeling.
p251/p251_153|It is not normal practice.
p251/p251_181|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p251/p251_060|It is not great art.
p251/p251_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p251/p251_312|The results are sometimes contentious.
p251/p251_059|It's a real challenge.
p251/p251_073|It is a time bomb.
p251/p251_061|They're appalled by that.
p251/p251_166|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p251/p251_218|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p251/p251_307|This is a national crisis.
p251/p251_267|We run within the law.
p251/p251_072|It was chaotic.
p251/p251_258|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p251/p251_096|Journalists should make him.
p251/p251_276|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p251/p251_287|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p251/p251_355|I'm very lucky.
p251/p251_171|I always felt they played for me.
p251/p251_150|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p251/p251_322|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p251/p251_334|That's the law of the land.
p251/p251_098|Two of the team became ill.
p251/p251_066|He was popular.
p251/p251_029|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p251/p251_084|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p251/p251_053|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p251/p251_146|It is like a football team.
p251/p251_049|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p251/p251_161|Eight months later, he was dead.
p251/p251_124|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p251/p251_062|It's that kind of place.
p251/p251_201|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p251/p251_242|They had no children.
p251/p251_237|But he failed to win the committee's support.
p251/p251_367|He has seen the past.
p251/p251_325|The letters are going out today.
p251/p251_040|It was clear.
p251/p251_079|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p251/p251_178|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p251/p251_224|It's just a place to open it.
p251/p251_225|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p251/p251_046|That should do it.
p251/p251_127|Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
p251/p251_186|I cannot say too much about them.
p251/p251_051|He had no enemies.
p251/p251_092|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p251/p251_346|In Scotland, we keep the faith.
p251/p251_106|He was jailed for a year.
p251/p251_283|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p251/p251_233|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p251/p251_294|Things can change.
p251/p251_259|They tried to give her advice.
p251/p251_093|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p251/p251_122|She has been shot.
p251/p251_241|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p251/p251_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p251/p251_357|The composer will conduct.
p251/p251_249|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p251/p251_240|However, no further action was taken by police.
p251/p251_109|You had better believe it.
p251/p251_290|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p251/p251_339|He was not a big name.
p251/p251_054|I had relied on him.
p251/p251_110|I was angry.
p251/p251_372|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p251/p251_332|However, the groups denied the claims.
p251/p251_204|I saw some terrible things.
p251/p251_226|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p251/p251_273|I was happily surprised.
p251/p251_055|This is a step backwards.
p251/p251_001|Please call Stella.
p251/p251_139|I had decided to quit the show.
p251/p251_231|We played them off the pitch.
p251/p251_129|It was the same at Twickenham.
p251/p251_205|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p251/p251_104|Further protests are likely.
p251/p251_070|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p251/p251_078|I was too young.
p251/p251_163|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p251/p251_052|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p251/p251_120|We work on the same level.
p251/p251_090|It is an old family habit.
p251/p251_278|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p251/p251_257|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p251/p251_050|It is the whole package.
p251/p251_175|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p251/p251_105|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p251/p251_068|That was the easy election.
p251/p251_221|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p251/p251_289|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p251/p251_045|I feel pretty good.
p251/p251_156|I saw one body.
p251/p251_272|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p251/p251_356|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p251/p251_028|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p251/p251_364|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p308/p308_109|Or so it would appear.
p308/p308_303|My friends were very envious.
p308/p308_027|Each one has its own system.
p308/p308_029|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p308/p308_187|Luckily, our patient was stable.
p308/p308_361|They have not let anyone into the loop.
p308/p308_293|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p308/p308_371|We have fun in our lives.
p308/p308_104|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p308/p308_340|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p308/p308_127|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p308/p308_326|Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
p308/p308_290|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p308/p308_318|So, the question is, is it any good?
p308/p308_411|Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
p308/p308_197|It's not just for classical music.
p308/p308_096|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p308/p308_418|Or so she thought.
p308/p308_143|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p308/p308_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p308/p308_415|She took them for a term.
p308/p308_382|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p308/p308_315|It's like the Russians.
p308/p308_135|The European Court is our only option.
p308/p308_098|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p308/p308_329|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p308/p308_045|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p308/p308_245|Mr Miller is married with three children.
p308/p308_225|No meaningful response was issued.
p308/p308_117|I want to play at the highest level.
p308/p308_131|I heard some of his remarks.
p308/p308_244|I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
p308/p308_316|Is that Titanic?
p308/p308_160|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p308/p308_107|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p308/p308_412|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p308/p308_221|They make it look very easy.
p308/p308_422|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p308/p308_139|The singer's condition was not specified.
p308/p308_205|We have chosen for the patients.
p308/p308_280|However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
p308/p308_213|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p308/p308_082|PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
p308/p308_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p308/p308_392|I find it puzzling and disturbing.
p308/p308_321|My players have no idea about football.
p308/p308_342|I just need a bit of luck.
p308/p308_115|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p308/p308_314|Tonight's matches European Championship.
p308/p308_328|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p308/p308_278|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
p308/p308_196|To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
p308/p308_279|Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
p308/p308_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p308/p308_410|There are simply no orders.
p308/p308_061|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p308/p308_297|I'm trying to stay open on that.
p308/p308_330|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p308/p308_268|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p308/p308_167|But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
p308/p308_274|He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
p308/p308_332|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p308/p308_248|He should be a great asset.
p308/p308_114|It is time for a more honest approach.
p308/p308_231|There is no reason at all.
p308/p308_154|I know you went back this morning.
p308/p308_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p308/p308_077|It is simple, really.
p308/p308_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p308/p308_237|I had a sense of deja vu.
p308/p308_243|I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
p308/p308_386|Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
p308/p308_036|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p308/p308_124|There is only one caveat.
p308/p308_322|They are there to get people into work.
p308/p308_110|I hope they understand that.
p308/p308_353|Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
p308/p308_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p308/p308_185|Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
p308/p308_194|Or so we have long assumed.
p308/p308_291|His is a success story by any standard.
p308/p308_403|It's a very high number.
p308/p308_087|Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
p308/p308_241|There was no safety net.
p308/p308_288|Then came the collision with Sergio.
p308/p308_119|It ignores the future.
p308/p308_158|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p308/p308_325|Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
p308/p308_343|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p308/p308_038|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p308/p308_042|We are looking for volunteers.
p308/p308_226|It is a form of physical exercise.
p308/p308_233|There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
p308/p308_030|It is a very special city.
p308/p308_086|She could easily have been killed.
p308/p308_201|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p308/p308_256|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p308/p308_299|I really don't understand what is happening.
p308/p308_163|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p308/p308_404|I leave tonight for England.
p308/p308_319|I'm getting back up there now.
p308/p308_286|The new system will be marketed this summer.
p308/p308_189|People buy everything with cash.
p308/p308_151|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p308/p308_091|He was a crazy man.
p308/p308_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p308/p308_180|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p308/p308_396|At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
p308/p308_249|It means they actually control the programme.
p308/p308_178|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p308/p308_175|It is time to come into the limelight.
p308/p308_207|Why should we even be asked to share?
p308/p308_339|ADVENTURE is the champagne of life.
p308/p308_210|I was surprised by his response.
p308/p308_085|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p308/p308_162|The red card was okay.
p308/p308_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p308/p308_250|And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
p308/p308_195|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p308/p308_080|You, the British people, are the boss.
p308/p308_206|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p308/p308_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p308/p308_420|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p308/p308_041|It could have been just a quick fix.
p308/p308_209|There is great potential on this river.
p308/p308_359|The discussions will surely not last too long.
p308/p308_265|We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
p308/p308_105|It separates the men from the boys.
p308/p308_142|It will be the final push.
p308/p308_295|We work on the same level.
p308/p308_040|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p308/p308_171|There is no date on this document.
p308/p308_317|Let us hope so.
p308/p308_069|I hope we can put it behind us.
p308/p308_095|There was an element of jealousy.
p308/p308_204|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p308/p308_378|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p308/p308_058|We must improve our relations with government.
p308/p308_064|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p308/p308_169|We must put a marker down.
p308/p308_262|It's not one for the purists.
p308/p308_296|I've got a young family.
p308/p308_375|Ferguson should take note.
p308/p308_350|There are two games to go after that.
p308/p308_218|They could go no further forward.
p308/p308_176|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p308/p308_254|We are at a crossroads.
p308/p308_144|You were the kidnappers.
p308/p308_308|The list is too long for this piece.
p308/p308_208|Which means it matters.
p308/p308_059|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p308/p308_372|This, too, could prove a risky business.
p308/p308_310|Entries for the event are still being accepted.
p308/p308_173|Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
p308/p308_165|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p308/p308_212|River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
p308/p308_186|They've two children.
p308/p308_344|I always felt they played for me.
p308/p308_287|I'd love to be like Peter.
p308/p308_121|The trial is set for February.
p308/p308_184|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p308/p308_364|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p308/p308_272|I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
p308/p308_217|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p308/p308_383|It's like a garage.
p308/p308_393|He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
p308/p308_333|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p308/p308_276|We've turned the corner.
p308/p308_351|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p308/p308_214|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p308/p308_255|We are satisfied with this outcome.
p308/p308_263|She said he showed no remorse.
p308/p308_358|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p308/p308_320|I couldn't see any reason not to die.
p308/p308_229|It is something that we will put right.
p308/p308_292|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p308/p308_302|I am a wealthy person.
p308/p308_374|We're not comparing like with like.
p308/p308_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p308/p308_251|We are not out of touch with politics.
p308/p308_348|Everything else is a bonus.
p308/p308_099|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p308/p308_159|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p308/p308_177|His name is Michael Owen.
p308/p308_032|He is not very big, either.
p308/p308_057|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p308/p308_100|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p308/p308_215|Is this accurate?
p308/p308_134|It had been in place since last July.
p308/p308_181|Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
p308/p308_183|Smith has not let him down.
p308/p308_421|The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
p308/p308_341|She's a valuable member of the Government.
p308/p308_399|It remains in public ownership.
p308/p308_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p308/p308_238|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p308/p308_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
p308/p308_281|We've taken steps to rectify it.
p308/p308_397|The report is due out next month.
p308/p308_389|The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
p308/p308_111|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p308/p308_106|But that attachment took a lot of growing.
p308/p308_136|Do you think they would do any better?
p308/p308_301|Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
p308/p308_283|Do yourselves a favour.
p308/p308_337|There was no hint of bravado.
p308/p308_376|We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
p308/p308_053|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p308/p308_054|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p308/p308_219|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p308/p308_078|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p308/p308_391|Would you take them?
p308/p308_028|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p308/p308_103|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p308/p308_070|But it was to no avail.
p308/p308_258|This meeting is the path to salvation.
p308/p308_155|We did not want an absentee landlord.
p308/p308_052|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p308/p308_388|We've got to get it right.
p308/p308_090|The same goes for personnel.
p308/p308_123|Do not go into government buildings.
p308/p308_335|Military chiefs were playing it straight.
p308/p308_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p308/p308_416|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p308/p308_228|But, by that time, of course, it is again.
p308/p308_227|plays in dark blue.
p308/p308_354|She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
p308/p308_400|The Master was by then just too old.
p308/p308_331|I'd go to bookshops.
p308/p308_356|This is a dreadful day for Iona.
p308/p308_365|Last night was a key episode.
p308/p308_334|Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
p308/p308_076|You do have a way out.
p308/p308_409|I have no argument with Scotland.
p308/p308_168|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p308/p308_401|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
p308/p308_362|So just what is her enduring appeal?
p308/p308_260|I started on fire a couple of times.
p308/p308_385|It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
p308/p308_133|I was just overwhelmed.
p308/p308_033|I've taken to the hills.
p308/p308_191|It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
p308/p308_039|All of us do.
p308/p308_129|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p308/p308_108|Two and a half million people have died.
p308/p308_402|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p308/p308_216|A judicial review is also being considered.
p308/p308_407|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p308/p308_370|I am content with the silver.
p308/p308_405|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
p308/p308_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p308/p308_423|In fact, they should have scored three times.
p308/p308_081|A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
p308/p308_145|It is a very interesting subject.
p308/p308_336|Adams is surely worth a chance.
p308/p308_271|Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
p308/p308_261|He also received a medal of honour.
p308/p308_224|And we're not there yet.
p308/p308_313|To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
p308/p308_141|The whole region is in shock.
p308/p308_347|The princess has had other health problems.
p308/p308_193|Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
p308/p308_349|The hotel was now for sale.
p308/p308_373|You have to audition for jobs.
p308/p308_102|Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
p308/p308_246|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
p308/p308_073|That alibi is now gone.
p308/p308_357|He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
p308/p308_031|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p308/p308_034|My game is in pretty good shape.
p308/p308_088|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p308/p308_360|We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p308/p308_277|This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
p308/p308_153|I'm afraid to say anything.
p308/p308_323|I'm getting long in the tooth.
p308/p308_270|The outstanding issues are still there.
p308/p308_118|Stalkers are capable of killing.
p308/p308_132|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p308/p308_140|How much of a cop out is that?
p308/p308_222|It was a total surprise.
p308/p308_049|Happily we found it in the library.
p308/p308_063|The quality of life is difficult for them.
p308/p308_338|You've been a great audience.
p308/p308_282|I see no need for change.
p308/p308_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p308/p308_395|I'd never seen a play about me.
p308/p308_037|We used to keep our business rates.
p308/p308_234|I'm pleased with the horse.
p308/p308_247|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p308/p308_138|Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
p308/p308_116|I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
p308/p308_148|The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
p308/p308_417|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p308/p308_097|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p308/p308_394|His condition was stable last night.
p308/p308_125|We are still getting signals.
p308/p308_390|His death was a tragic accident.
p308/p308_192|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p308/p308_051|There was nobody on the roof.
p308/p308_093|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p308/p308_211|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p308/p308_166|I was doing well at the hustings.
p308/p308_198|This must be kept in total perspective.
p308/p308_398|It was nerve-racking to watch.
p308/p308_242|So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
p308/p308_067|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p308/p308_203|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p308/p308_199|All of the names are familiar to me.
p308/p308_050|I know a lot of people who don't.
p308/p308_379|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p308/p308_284|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p308/p308_257|It didn't take long.
p308/p308_307|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p308/p308_146|The women were on their way home yesterday.
p308/p308_232|This is her first senior Scottish selection.
p308/p308_172|And now he tells us.
p308/p308_275|That got me out of jail.
p308/p308_408|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p308/p308_112|She will also get a pay rise.
p308/p308_369|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p308/p308_367|It is normal for me.
p308/p308_346|Managers and clinicians must work together.
p308/p308_220|Appointed general secretary last September.
p308/p308_345|Again, it's about responding to your resources.
p308/p308_150|Debbie Harry was cool.
p308/p308_269|Three years probation is just a joke.
p308/p308_122|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p308/p308_137|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p308/p308_179|I will have to order its destruction.
p308/p308_190|There was great support all round the route.
p308/p308_240|I couldn't make out what was going on.
p308/p308_128|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p308/p308_253|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p308/p308_239|They follow him everywhere.
p308/p308_157|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p308/p308_266|It is a time bomb.
p308/p308_304|The snipers are also out.
p308/p308_068|YOU thought it was a headache.
p308/p308_381|That is not just my personal view.
p308/p308_130|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p308/p308_055|The days of empty promises are over.
p308/p308_298|It all seemed so easy.
p308/p308_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p308/p308_413|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p308/p308_084|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p308/p308_149|Well, it's not before time, is it?
p308/p308_047|They don't take you to mass graves.
p308/p308_380|She was released from hospital yesterday.
p308/p308_035|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p308/p308_366|I grew up listening to these people.
p308/p308_230|Survival is our aim.
p308/p308_092|We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
p308/p308_311|It plans to return to this field.
p308/p308_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p308/p308_368|But it may not be all bad news.
p308/p308_062|He said it was the worst possible result.
p308/p308_273|And that's good news for the magpies.
p308/p308_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p308/p308_089|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p308/p308_285|Others said they had been beaten by police.
p308/p308_046|He could face a jail sentence.
p308/p308_252|We could have got three medals.
p308/p308_026|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p308/p308_327|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p308/p308_074|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p308/p308_152|That sort of thing is long gone.
p308/p308_309|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p308/p308_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p308/p308_377|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p308/p308_075|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p308/p308_289|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p308/p308_072|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p308/p308_065|It is just part of modern day life.
p308/p308_355|It was a UK-wide report.
p308/p308_305|Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
p308/p308_071|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p308/p308_223|I had enough on.
p308/p308_387|You just have to accept.
p308/p308_156|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p308/p308_352|His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
p308/p308_094|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p308/p308_235|But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
p308/p308_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p308/p308_306|We're determined to establish the facts.
p308/p308_384|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p308/p308_079|I was in jail for five years.
p308/p308_188|I'm really proud of my young players.
p308/p308_066|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p308/p308_174|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p308/p308_414|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p308/p308_060|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p308/p308_419|It was another good idea.
p308/p308_025|It does make a big difference.
p308/p308_170|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p308/p308_083|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p308/p308_294|Is something which we just don't do.
p308/p308_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p308/p308_264|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p308/p308_312|However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
p308/p308_200|They had not been handcuffed.
p308/p308_113|They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
p308/p308_324|They would be wise to do just that.
p308/p308_126|And perhaps it is as simple as that.
p308/p308_182|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p308/p308_161|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p308/p308_164|But they will not be compelled to join.
p308/p308_044|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p308/p308_101|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p308/p308_120|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p308/p308_043|Theatre is not a museum.
p308/p308_363|It's not easy to live in Russia.
p308/p308_202|I've never been limited on drugs.
p308/p308_056|Henry was strong and talented.
p308/p308_048|What's it got to do with art?
p308/p308_008|They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p308/p308_236|There is a club on the rise.
p308/p308_259|Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
p308/p308_300|The frustration was showing.
p308/p308_267|It's a matter of huge concern.
p308/p308_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p308/p308_147|I could feel the blood on my face.
p308/p308_001|Please call Stella.
p308/p308_406|This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
p294/p294_336|Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
p294/p294_082|It was like a vacuum.
p294/p294_285|He had asked if they had the script.
p294/p294_398|No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
p294/p294_185|It's a huge amount.
p294/p294_146|You ask the question.
p294/p294_170|We have managed to get it under control.
p294/p294_152|It's a wonderful piece of water.
p294/p294_419|We have every respect for Michelle.
p294/p294_305|If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
p294/p294_151|It's like a score in some ways.
p294/p294_215|They will form a tribute.
p294/p294_153|Feel the air, the space.
p294/p294_113|I don't know the nature of the illness.
p294/p294_267|I would love to travel with it.
p294/p294_207|It will take some time to establish.
p294/p294_259|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p294/p294_339|What's it for?
p294/p294_284|This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
p294/p294_155|You feel the pride.
p294/p294_358|No decision on that was taken.
p294/p294_037|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p294/p294_242|That is however, the only part of the story.
p294/p294_270|We will work through the night.
p294/p294_420|Mr Blunkett was convinced.
p294/p294_197|He said nothing to waiting journalists.
p294/p294_290|It's a blunt instrument anyway.
p294/p294_335|But it took a lot of bottle.
p294/p294_314|It is three years at present.
p294/p294_070|I don't have any answer for them.
p294/p294_306|The order went out.
p294/p294_264|It possibly depends on the position.
p294/p294_142|Where are they?
p294/p294_388|But what is?
p294/p294_101|It's annoying in a way.
p294/p294_299|We started from scratch.
p294/p294_408|If you could find it.
p294/p294_103|It's a long process.
p294/p294_120|My father and mother are.
p294/p294_353|They had to explain it.
p294/p294_104|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p294/p294_059|We are only human.
p294/p294_181|He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
p294/p294_399|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p294/p294_262|I thought he was terrific.
p294/p294_163|He deserves a second chance.
p294/p294_019|Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p294/p294_293|That case has still not been settled.
p294/p294_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p294/p294_198|O Leary was clearly disgusted.
p294/p294_048|I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
p294/p294_266|We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
p294/p294_217|It's not a question of talking.
p294/p294_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p294/p294_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p294/p294_072|I found the course inspiring.
p294/p294_395|The council's concern is very simple.
p294/p294_168|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p294/p294_273|Boy is the town a mess.
p294/p294_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p294/p294_071|It took about five or six hours.
p294/p294_096|It may not even be possible.
p294/p294_195|It is misleading to compare the two.
p294/p294_086|We have to focus on what is important.
p294/p294_140|It was a hugely popular decision.
p294/p294_222|She has so much to offer.
p294/p294_410|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p294/p294_177|I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
p294/p294_148|We are all very proud of her.
p294/p294_251|Mental health is a massive issue.
p294/p294_374|We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
p294/p294_093|But now it's back to golf.
p294/p294_279|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p294/p294_276|Neither of them was badly hurt.
p294/p294_261|It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
p294/p294_345|Where are you taking her?
p294/p294_035|A neighbour said the street was shocked.
p294/p294_051|Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
p294/p294_402|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
p294/p294_321|We know we have done wrong.
p294/p294_318|Now they have found out the truth.
p294/p294_341|Anything can happen - at any moment.
p294/p294_001|Please call Stella.
p294/p294_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p294/p294_326|Which is where the manager comes in.
p294/p294_283|This is our unfinished business.
p294/p294_056|This is a possible way forward.
p294/p294_068|Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
p294/p294_074|This is the real thing now.
p294/p294_180|My place is in the kitchen.
p294/p294_052|The course record was in his name.
p294/p294_338|No-one else was hurt.
p294/p294_065|People remember the Tories in office.
p294/p294_184|That's the name of the game, though.
p294/p294_315|The document is a starting point for discussion.
p294/p294_172|Art is still a risky investment.
p294/p294_034|Other people had looked at it.
p294/p294_183|It was a big departure.
p294/p294_192|You can't believe a word.
p294/p294_412|It was not known to myself.
p294/p294_303|And this tournament will travel.
p294/p294_233|We have seen the future, and it is different.
p294/p294_062|Debate is not just talk.
p294/p294_045|They tend to be female and retired.
p294/p294_214|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p294/p294_055|We should not bring him into a dispute.
p294/p294_281|I've never seen them down here.
p294/p294_040|My view has now changed completely.
p294/p294_241|I couldn't have asked for better.
p294/p294_189|The First Minister is an addict.
p294/p294_243|But happily, the story is true.
p294/p294_411|It raises the edge.
p294/p294_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p294/p294_407|I don't think there's going to be one.
p294/p294_349|I'm not going to change from it.
p294/p294_064|It is all about having physical evidence.
p294/p294_158|The Treasury denied the claims.
p294/p294_376|Social workers are on stand-by to help.
p294/p294_292|This could also affect the sentencing.
p294/p294_378|There could be a way back.
p294/p294_260|I haven't a clue.
p294/p294_316|We all make mistakes.
p294/p294_368|He found it very hard to understand.
p294/p294_364|I've got to provide for my family.
p294/p294_268|Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
p294/p294_405|It's a tragedy for the area.
p294/p294_132|I'm deeply sorry they did.
p294/p294_297|The acting left a lot to be desired.
p294/p294_178|Harry will be up for it.
p294/p294_360|The trial continues today.
p294/p294_066|What kind of inclusion is that?
p294/p294_355|The support of Britain is assumed.
p294/p294_226|Advice and counselling will be offered.
p294/p294_289|So it was sad.
p294/p294_105|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p294/p294_343|There are moments of joy in politics.
p294/p294_209|And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
p294/p294_396|We are on the path of change.
p294/p294_255|There are still some matters to be discussed.
p294/p294_417|I saw it in a different way.
p294/p294_346|Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
p294/p294_213|We are very, very pleased with the response.
p294/p294_031|They were impressive against France.
p294/p294_413|It is a delight on every level.
p294/p294_216|We're very, very excited.
p294/p294_254|Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
p294/p294_116|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p294/p294_370|But who was driving it?
p294/p294_280|It was one in the afternoon.
p294/p294_186|The fire was falling from the sky.
p294/p294_377|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p294/p294_239|Do it for us now.
p294/p294_028|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p294/p294_107|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p294/p294_274|It's as simple as that.
p294/p294_098|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p294/p294_383|Are there muscular problems?
p294/p294_123|He seems to be used to the attention.
p294/p294_228|I could not believe what they were saying.
p294/p294_352|They are not falling now.
p294/p294_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p294/p294_108|That's not part of the deal.
p294/p294_043|We're playing away from home and that's it.
p294/p294_397|Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
p294/p294_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p294/p294_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p294/p294_347|It's just not our biggest problem.
p294/p294_271|I also thought, This is a feature film.
p294/p294_143|It's hard not to.
p294/p294_403|We will deal with the refugees.
p294/p294_171|We have a genuine budget in place.
p294/p294_337|That period was a struggle.
p294/p294_379|He edited the press release.
p294/p294_119|We have now no choice.
p294/p294_366|And it had two seats.
p294/p294_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p294/p294_111|We have great confidence in Derek.
p294/p294_236|I just have to accept that.
p294/p294_224|It should be a pretty exciting session.
p294/p294_201|All options are on the table.
p294/p294_309|You could see he was thinking about it.
p294/p294_327|Is that what people we want?
p294/p294_164|He also admitted.
p294/p294_188|This is simply unjust.
p294/p294_257|I get on him, he gets on me.
p294/p294_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p294/p294_406|It was very well received.
p294/p294_206|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p294/p294_173|It was little else.
p294/p294_092|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p294/p294_205|Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
p294/p294_304|Could it have been better spent?
p294/p294_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p294/p294_131|I can't see him reversing that.
p294/p294_342|She is an imposing presence.
p294/p294_144|It is a question of life and death.
p294/p294_307|Cinema is a communal experience.
p294/p294_191|It is becoming a bit of a habit.
p294/p294_084|It is a very genuine prospect.
p294/p294_112|My ambition is to tell a good story.
p294/p294_252|His director of football is leaving.
p294/p294_250|There are no excuses left for us.
p294/p294_286|It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
p294/p294_244|They are not suitable.
p294/p294_097|In fact, they go hand in hand.
p294/p294_110|This has gone on too long.
p294/p294_041|I've been dying for an hour.
p294/p294_179|He could tell you.
p294/p294_308|The appeal is impartial.
p294/p294_333|Iraq has no interest in war.
p294/p294_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p294/p294_249|But it was a pleasure.
p294/p294_225|Gas is too expensive.
p294/p294_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p294/p294_128|I can't speak for him.
p294/p294_384|We had our chances.
p294/p294_127|People will see this over time.
p294/p294_291|There did not need to be a miracle.
p294/p294_109|That was the context of his remarks.
p294/p294_099|So is that it, then?
p294/p294_401|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p294/p294_049|We've all done it!
p294/p294_298|Who will provide the wine?
p294/p294_203|We now have a moment of hope.
p294/p294_169|I enjoy my work.
p294/p294_344|Is a drug dealer?
p294/p294_039|He got the same story.
p294/p294_176|You have to go to the edges.
p294/p294_354|We didn't mean to kill him.
p294/p294_229|The protest will go ahead as planned.
p294/p294_089|Seven British members of the club are missing.
p294/p294_138|Above all, the approach is upbeat.
p294/p294_362|Europe is a bonus.
p294/p294_100|You should have let it write the cards.
p294/p294_088|It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
p294/p294_415|I don't entirely buy that.
p294/p294_393|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p294/p294_372|But opponents were quick to criticise.
p294/p294_329|Then it was into a series of classes.
p294/p294_122|Did he just want to be on telly?
p294/p294_296|It just would not work.
p294/p294_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p294/p294_175|Family members are at her bedside.
p294/p294_387|He is in the queue.
p294/p294_032|I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
p294/p294_351|That was the type of man he was.
p294/p294_058|Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
p294/p294_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p294/p294_091|There's a strong involvement.
p294/p294_054|What is the point of jailing him?
p294/p294_199|That's been the case for a while.
p294/p294_253|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p294/p294_073|Two things were clear from the new programme.
p294/p294_392|My mind was made up.
p294/p294_381|It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
p294/p294_106|The other conditions were not specified.
p294/p294_332|The need for further investment is obvious.
p294/p294_423|Athletics is on a roll in the country.
p294/p294_139|The objective was achieved.
p294/p294_044|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p294/p294_079|Three bystanders were killed.
p294/p294_159|You've been working for four years.
p294/p294_085|It is the tip of the iceberg.
p294/p294_325|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p294/p294_063|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p294/p294_187|I want my mum.
p294/p294_301|Their bid was a very good one.
p294/p294_067|I fell in love with it right away.
p294/p294_167|It had until tomorrow to comply.
p294/p294_156|We are well insured.
p294/p294_375|We need to increase the membership.
p294/p294_230|Who will run the bigger show?
p294/p294_323|I wanted to drop out.
p294/p294_117|And she got it.
p294/p294_287|This could take a few days.
p294/p294_421|The auction will be held tomorrow.
p294/p294_204|They should not be blamed for it.
p294/p294_416|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p294/p294_042|It wasn't a flight of fancy.
p294/p294_389|It wasn't about her singing, though.
p294/p294_386|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p294/p294_033|The airport was even different.
p294/p294_361|People come to see the Highlands.
p294/p294_050|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p294/p294_069|It makes for an interesting conference.
p294/p294_319|It is an impressive record.
p294/p294_165|There was no change in the strategy.
p294/p294_380|Visitors were also impressed.
p294/p294_221|The six others were injured.
p294/p294_359|My fitness was very poor.
p294/p294_029|I was pregnant and very worried.
p294/p294_265|This will have no effect on the championship.
p294/p294_404|The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
p294/p294_324|I told you so.
p294/p294_182|A decision is expected in September.
p294/p294_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p294/p294_060|I went with the mood.
p294/p294_076|She now lives in London.
p294/p294_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p294/p294_247|Everything else is the same.
p294/p294_030|He said she was mad.
p294/p294_025|They were the better team on the night.
p294/p294_147|She was always a quality act.
p294/p294_157|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p294/p294_278|It is a very disturbing picture for men.
p294/p294_391|Calvin was back at his best today.
p294/p294_330|He wants to play in the Champions League.
p294/p294_269|It is a common condition in children.
p294/p294_322|She was married with one son.
p294/p294_394|And rugby fans can help.
p294/p294_363|It is also used to buy coffins.
p294/p294_231|General, You didn't get a modified.
p294/p294_382|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p294/p294_275|We've been here before.
p294/p294_422|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p294/p294_200|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p294/p294_027|It means we have to have some patience.
p294/p294_294|What do they do, anyway?
p294/p294_348|The result could be all down to turnout.
p294/p294_141|He invented the language.
p294/p294_154|Therein lies the problem.
p294/p294_087|They have to work so hard.
p294/p294_212|I have no secrets.
p294/p294_365|Such debate is pointless.
p294/p294_134|I have had a wonderful career.
p294/p294_340|Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
p294/p294_078|Subs not used, McGraw.
p294/p294_210|This came as no great surprise to anyone.
p294/p294_288|A great deal was achieved.
p294/p294_220|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p294/p294_095|Was it a signal?
p294/p294_248|They never gave up hope.
p294/p294_149|I'm sure that is not.
p294/p294_313|We work for the athlete.
p294/p294_311|They have nowhere else to go.
p294/p294_263|A statement is expected in April.
p294/p294_115|Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
p294/p294_038|Their ambition is to go back.
p294/p294_080|One policeman was killed.
p294/p294_124|It's an hour of the same response.
p294/p294_240|We got the guarantee.
p294/p294_126|He has gone through the process before.
p294/p294_047|This was no accident.
p294/p294_166|There's been a mistake.
p294/p294_053|But we welcome this document.
p294/p294_061|I think we'll just keep it.
p294/p294_208|This club is perfect for me.
p294/p294_245|Some days are different from others.
p294/p294_258|They are in care for a reason.
p294/p294_371|We recorded it at our own expense.
p294/p294_081|They could not have done more for me.
p294/p294_075|Until they came to do it.
p294/p294_136|This takes the pressure off.
p294/p294_129|They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
p294/p294_026|The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
p294/p294_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p294/p294_418|Or, rather, it isn't.
p294/p294_125|We have very real concerns about it.
p294/p294_174|These things can happen.
p294/p294_414|Would it really be good to shorten it?
p294/p294_211|I love this job.
p294/p294_272|For now, they have gone as far as they can.
p294/p294_400|Of course, it doesn't all come off.
p294/p294_046|Who was the mystery MP?
p294/p294_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p294/p294_331|I'm so happy that she did.
p294/p294_235|We're talking about one or two years.
p294/p294_145|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p294/p294_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p294/p294_320|Johnson was pretty low.
p294/p294_202|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p294/p294_300|There was no happiness.
p294/p294_367|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p294/p294_094|It should be a condition of employment.
p294/p294_036|Michael, he is running!
p294/p294_282|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p294/p294_277|From there, it was a success story.
p294/p294_234|Who does he think will win?
p294/p294_121|We don't know what happened after.
p294/p294_193|Something happened on that island.
p294/p294_295|They've got a mountain to climb.
p294/p294_237|He was overwhelmed by the response.
p294/p294_302|Everything is so commercial.
p294/p294_114|The industry will try to get round it.
p294/p294_223|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p294/p294_227|Are we going mainstream?
p294/p294_057|I am not here to get even.
p294/p294_256|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p294/p294_409|Such is the ego involved.
p294/p294_160|I am the Son of Sam.
p294/p294_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p294/p294_357|He completely loses control.
p294/p294_350|There were no violations.
p294/p294_133|I can lead by example.
p294/p294_137|It was different in the endurance events.
p294/p294_150|It's a great idea.
p294/p294_135|It seemed to have direction.
p294/p294_369|But it would change the context.
p294/p294_102|It's too close to call.
p294/p294_190|Its role is not to interfere.
p294/p294_194|You can't get a mortgage.
p294/p294_390|We have other options.
p294/p294_077|It will not be a long campaign.
p294/p294_218|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p294/p294_090|He had just returned from a run.
p294/p294_161|There is no shortage of commitment.
p294/p294_356|So far he has not done so.
p294/p294_232|I'm not a little girl.
p294/p294_312|However, it seems that he got it wrong.
p294/p294_162|Such as it is.
p294/p294_219|Then they killed another three.
p294/p294_334|It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
p294/p294_238|They will do nothing for the local people.
p294/p294_424|He died at the hands of his captors.
p294/p294_118|We are the weakest link.
p294/p294_373|Try to save us.
p294/p294_328|There are so many unanswered questions.
p294/p294_196|I want a career.
p294/p294_310|He added, We are full of anger.
p294/p294_317|It didn't put me off.
p294/p294_083|That was enough for the committee.
p294/p294_130|The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
p294/p294_385|However, many questions remained unanswered.
p254/p254_211|It's not ideal.
p254/p254_371|They play together perfectly.
p254/p254_339|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p254/p254_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p254/p254_349|It was very formal.
p254/p254_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p254/p254_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p254/p254_397|I can lead by example.
p254/p254_353|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p254/p254_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p254/p254_242|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p254/p254_118|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p254/p254_107|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p254/p254_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p254/p254_033|It's a matter of balance.
p254/p254_340|They should take their mobile phones.
p254/p254_095|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p254/p254_386|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p254/p254_065|That's the day job.
p254/p254_333|Today she has been released.
p254/p254_152|It is not just about pay.
p254/p254_351|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p254/p254_332|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p254/p254_334|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p254/p254_001|Please call Stella.
p254/p254_042|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p254/p254_091|It may well have been.
p254/p254_106|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p254/p254_061|This is a club on the rise.
p254/p254_160|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p254/p254_342|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p254/p254_300|The plot is minimal.
p254/p254_366|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p254/p254_207|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p254/p254_336|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p254/p254_090|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p254/p254_247|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p254/p254_233|They should come forward.
p254/p254_256|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p254/p254_402|The car was just there.
p254/p254_294|These figures are truly awful.
p254/p254_053|It's a blessing.
p254/p254_275|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p254/p254_403|It was on fire.
p254/p254_244|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p254/p254_307|Craig is a major concern for us.
p254/p254_250|There's the mix.
p254/p254_305|They were fantastic.
p254/p254_323|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p254/p254_183|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p254/p254_258|The pensioners did not want to know.
p254/p254_310|It is out there.
p254/p254_394|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p254/p254_181|I was totally wrong.
p254/p254_316|The parents will have a great time, too.
p254/p254_156|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p254/p254_285|I saw it at a ruck.
p254/p254_315|It is a strong case.
p254/p254_297|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p254/p254_260|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p254/p254_223|The track is currently covered in snow.
p254/p254_289|The mood is good.
p254/p254_357|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p254/p254_391|Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
p254/p254_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p254/p254_392|I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
p254/p254_239|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p254/p254_172|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p254/p254_140|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p254/p254_361|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p254/p254_365|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p254/p254_132|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p254/p254_109|But it was a pleasure.
p254/p254_047|I am just going to go for it.
p254/p254_393|I'm pleased about one thing.
p254/p254_362|The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
p254/p254_111|It was an adventure.
p254/p254_054|Is a drug dealer?
p254/p254_137|It plans to return to this field.
p254/p254_057|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p254/p254_321|The boat was fantastic.
p254/p254_245|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p254/p254_284|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p254/p254_147|It is difficult for Ali.
p254/p254_188|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p254/p254_062|He had no enemies.
p254/p254_367|They received a reply from their own managers.
p254/p254_243|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p254/p254_068|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p254/p254_063|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p254/p254_380|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p254/p254_209|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p254/p254_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p254/p254_159|This latter point is hugely important.
p254/p254_388|They really did a great job.
p254/p254_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p254/p254_309|My body is clearly capable.
p254/p254_230|They tried to give her advice.
p254/p254_058|He is too weak to move.
p254/p254_272|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p254/p254_096|All options are open.
p254/p254_069|My mother is a widow.
p254/p254_108|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p254/p254_043|I was scared.
p254/p254_262|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p254/p254_330|They haven't got a hope.
p254/p254_278|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p254/p254_178|The hotel was now for sale.
p254/p254_335|It should be a great game, though.
p254/p254_145|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p254/p254_167|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p254/p254_303|We have waited a long time for this.
p254/p254_329|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p254/p254_055|But it might have done.
p254/p254_358|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p254/p254_133|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p254/p254_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p254/p254_034|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p254/p254_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p254/p254_204|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p254/p254_374|It became a national network.
p254/p254_308|The problems began a long time ago.
p254/p254_179|Tony had arrived.
p254/p254_373|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p254/p254_186|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p254/p254_087|There was an e-mail.
p254/p254_389|At the last I found a bunker.
p254/p254_215|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p254/p254_219|We played them off the pitch.
p254/p254_382|I am very happy with life.
p254/p254_252|This year I understood.
p254/p254_030|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p254/p254_162|He's a nice guy.
p254/p254_085|My office is bare.
p254/p254_104|I love the Dome.
p254/p254_081|It's all I can do.
p254/p254_050|It's a crucial award.
p254/p254_100|Now the system is right behind us.
p254/p254_281|If not, he should go home.
p254/p254_189|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p254/p254_324|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p254/p254_153|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p254/p254_129|It is a job creation scheme.
p254/p254_144|Three penalties were given.
p254/p254_231|And thought we would get away with it.
p254/p254_146|He is severe.
p254/p254_216|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p254/p254_304|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p254/p254_396|We're looking for justice.
p254/p254_128|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p254/p254_282|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p254/p254_166|Tell it like it was?
p254/p254_279|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p254/p254_259|It is also very valuable.
p254/p254_212|The FBI could become involved.
p254/p254_251|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p254/p254_276|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p254/p254_232|We were a load of rubbish.
p254/p254_056|That time has passed.
p254/p254_094|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p254/p254_347|That is a break with tradition.
p254/p254_375|It is a large number.
p254/p254_296|Who can predict?
p254/p254_123|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p254/p254_115|It is normal.
p254/p254_199|Today was first class.
p254/p254_191|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p254/p254_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p254/p254_295|That could change.
p254/p254_158|We will turn the corner.
p254/p254_376|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p254/p254_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p254/p254_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p254/p254_187|Peace was won.
p254/p254_314|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p254/p254_194|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p254/p254_387|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p254/p254_182|We did everything by the book.
p254/p254_369|Five members were disciplined.
p254/p254_237|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p254/p254_076|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p254/p254_229|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p254/p254_176|It is not either national standards or local control.
p254/p254_318|He was not a big name.
p254/p254_395|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p254/p254_157|I was in daily contact.
p254/p254_139|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p254/p254_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p254/p254_110|He takes the job.
p254/p254_168|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p254/p254_073|They're appalled by that.
p254/p254_381|Face to face
p254/p254_385|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p254/p254_193|The conference is the first test.
p254/p254_249|He's a lovely young man.
p254/p254_135|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p254/p254_165|I have got a wife to feed.
p254/p254_125|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p254/p254_078|They never gave up hope.
p254/p254_052|That should do it.
p254/p254_399|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p254/p254_236|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p254/p254_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p254/p254_348|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p254/p254_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p254/p254_379|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p254/p254_261|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p254/p254_046|That period was a struggle.
p254/p254_206|It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
p254/p254_190|Off I went.
p254/p254_287|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254/p254_311|He said she was mad.
p254/p254_283|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p254/p254_049|This represents a tough game for us.
p254/p254_238|But it's a subtle process.
p254/p254_240|My future is in the marathon.
p254/p254_235|He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
p254/p254_163|It has to be now.
p254/p254_155|The weaknesses are few.
p254/p254_205|That is an important part of our role.
p254/p254_136|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p254/p254_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p254/p254_044|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p254/p254_122|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p254/p254_126|I joined a group.
p254/p254_031|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p254/p254_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p254/p254_180|He will need that machine.
p254/p254_301|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p254/p254_175|It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
p254/p254_164|They are not advertised.
p254/p254_266|This is a question of Islam.
p254/p254_037|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p254/p254_222|The boy is no longer with us.
p254/p254_234|It is not the message alone.
p254/p254_200|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p254/p254_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p254/p254_161|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p254/p254_059|Life is good.
p254/p254_093|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p254/p254_071|Jobs could go.
p254/p254_312|In the old days, it was easy.
p254/p254_218|Saturday is gone.
p254/p254_355|We will be homeless.
p254/p254_208|I began to pray.
p254/p254_134|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p254/p254_116|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p254/p254_225|It's so special.
p254/p254_060|It is the whole package.
p254/p254_120|They were behind the wheel.
p254/p254_268|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p254/p254_102|This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p254/p254_127|Does this mean.
p254/p254_288|He will address the nation this evening.
p254/p254_317|Donald was his friend.
p254/p254_074|There was a battle there.
p254/p254_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p254/p254_290|It's like a high school play.
p254/p254_197|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p254/p254_154|You know the type.
p254/p254_364|It's now down in black and white.
p254/p254_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p254/p254_302|I did not name it.
p254/p254_263|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p254/p254_051|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p254/p254_080|Painful, but only because it's true.
p254/p254_105|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p254/p254_041|It is not for any other purpose.
p254/p254_313|We are in the end game.
p254/p254_322|It's not long enough.
p254/p254_026|But it failed.
p254/p254_067|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p254/p254_363|There was no option.
p254/p254_270|It was an easy decision to come here.
p254/p254_228|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p254/p254_350|I kept going for her.
p254/p254_346|It's all going to clear the debt.
p254/p254_203|But I am a worried man.
p254/p254_246|He got the same story.
p254/p254_210|His third goal was superb.
p254/p254_277|It's a way of life.
p254/p254_032|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p254/p254_338|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p254/p254_306|We are a peaceful people.
p254/p254_141|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p254/p254_253|That could be in place by next year.
p254/p254_064|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p254/p254_092|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p254/p254_221|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p254/p254_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p254/p254_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p254/p254_150|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p254/p254_117|We need to handle it.
p254/p254_360|We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
p254/p254_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p254/p254_254|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p254/p254_185|I grew up listening to these people.
p254/p254_378|He has the edge.
p254/p254_072|Four other charges were dropped.
p254/p254_227|At the time, he was a living legend.
p254/p254_292|This is a national crisis.
p254/p254_195|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p254/p254_280|People have no choice.
p254/p254_401|It really is a gift to the world.
p254/p254_198|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p254/p254_354|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p254/p254_149|This is the way things should be handled.
p254/p254_048|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p254/p254_352|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p254/p254_101|However, it did not end that way.
p254/p254_383|I'm just enjoying every match.
p254/p254_130|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p254/p254_079|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p254/p254_170|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p254/p254_384|The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
p254/p254_029|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p254/p254_171|He was a crazy man.
p254/p254_088|Even the one she loved.
p254/p254_269|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p254/p254_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p254/p254_400|It was a breathtaking moment.
p254/p254_148|There is a lack of chemistry.
p254/p254_398|Eriksson would have approved.
p254/p254_112|That all hope is never lost.
p254/p254_241|They are all bright and different.
p254/p254_098|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p254/p254_097|You will be.
p254/p254_326|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p254/p254_082|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p254/p254_264|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p254/p254_202|It's like a garage.
p254/p254_217|You have to do your research.
p254/p254_066|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p254/p254_299|It is a road of death.
p254/p254_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p254/p254_027|They may be wrong.
p254/p254_083|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p254/p254_086|Is there a new way forward?
p254/p254_293|Well, he can do it.
p254/p254_045|No meaningful response was issued.
p254/p254_320|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p254/p254_257|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p254/p254_173|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p254/p254_169|We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
p254/p254_124|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p254/p254_343|It is long gone.
p254/p254_248|I was shocked.
p254/p254_119|It's a long process.
p254/p254_070|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p254/p254_039|They're just different.
p254/p254_113|And I thought - we have to do something with this.
p254/p254_345|Tell us about it.
p254/p254_151|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p254/p254_337|It should be scrapped.
p254/p254_271|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p254/p254_226|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p254/p254_174|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p254/p254_370|Talks are progressing.
p254/p254_298|One was a lawyer.
p254/p254_084|The price cuts are really exciting.
p254/p254_103|The group is due to report by the end of the year.
p254/p254_131|I'm so angry.
p254/p254_114|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p254/p254_390|Yet the data is compelling.
p254/p254_319|The police have to act to help them.
p254/p254_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p254/p254_372|Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
p254/p254_359|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p254/p254_291|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p254/p254_224|They are the innocent victims.
p254/p254_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p254/p254_356|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p254/p254_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p254/p254_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p254/p254_286|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p254/p254_265|There is no link.
p254/p254_192|Is that it?
p254/p254_143|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p254/p254_075|It's good news and long overdue.
p254/p254_327|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p254/p254_196|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p254/p254_341|It is not like working for a living.
p254/p254_201|We have an election in eight days.
p254/p254_273|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p254/p254_040|It was clear.
p254/p254_184|However, this idea is never developed.
p254/p254_331|It has moved on in the last week.
p254/p254_077|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p254/p254_121|The fire was above the hole.
p254/p254_267|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p254/p254_099|And rugby fans can help.
p254/p254_255|It's a source of deep concern.
p254/p254_138|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p254/p254_377|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p254/p254_177|The clarity is vital.
p254/p254_220|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p231/p231_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p231/p231_124|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p231/p231_128|That is far too high.
p231/p231_365|Neither woman has been named.
p231/p231_297|He will address the nation this evening.
p231/p231_114|Maybe this battle has been.
p231/p231_430|It was a breathtaking moment.
p231/p231_304|That was the difference between the sides.
p231/p231_322|We want to play at the worlds.
p231/p231_293|This could be a mistake.
p231/p231_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p231/p231_156|It is a terrible tragedy.
p231/p231_339|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p231/p231_370|This is a major championship.
p231/p231_383|Is it worth it?
p231/p231_392|There was a substantial explosion.
p231/p231_403|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p231/p231_211|They are looking at flotation.
p231/p231_241|The parties have no contact.
p231/p231_068|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p231/p231_318|That meant the search was unlawful.
p231/p231_463|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p231/p231_319|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p231/p231_362|You did not see it.
p231/p231_248|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p231/p231_407|There was an element of frustration.
p231/p231_200|Libya is an easy target.
p231/p231_391|The response from them was good.
p231/p231_065|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p231/p231_123|It was not a finale he would want to remember.
p231/p231_334|She is now on the back benches.
p231/p231_085|However, it did not end that way.
p231/p231_142|It only increased the support for him.
p231/p231_279|At first I thought I was gone.
p231/p231_411|After the match, do you?
p231/p231_223|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p231/p231_106|So what is the campaign about?
p231/p231_148|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p231/p231_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p231/p231_215|That might help a bit.
p231/p231_137|This is a successful outcome.
p231/p231_113|It proved a good decision.
p231/p231_177|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p231/p231_351|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p231/p231_036|But he can turn on the charm.
p231/p231_427|I would love to think that she could win.
p231/p231_048|There was no safety net.
p231/p231_385|You have to rely on each other.
p231/p231_139|Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
p231/p231_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p231/p231_419|The case will now go to appeal.
p231/p231_446|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p231/p231_135|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p231/p231_471|Dennis was not so sure.
p231/p231_316|We're on our way.
p231/p231_115|January is a bad time of year.
p231/p231_028|There was a rush of water.
p231/p231_138|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p231/p231_284|Blair also had a penalty.
p231/p231_090|I saw the whole thing.
p231/p231_219|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p231/p231_460|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p231/p231_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p231/p231_454|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p231/p231_451|We went straight into the bedroom.
p231/p231_372|But we finished the show.
p231/p231_192|People will ask about us.
p231/p231_426|My aim is a top six finish.
p231/p231_390|It was fit for royalty.
p231/p231_253|It was a cry for help.
p231/p231_428|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p231/p231_395|A review is under way.
p231/p231_310|McNaughton was not so sure.
p231/p231_432|I never had a childhood.
p231/p231_431|I was in jail for five years.
p231/p231_207|You've caught a serial killer.
p231/p231_275|It does not work that way in Scottish football.
p231/p231_027|Because we do not need it.
p231/p231_208|I won't make an official complaint.
p231/p231_032|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p231/p231_160|Are you going to win?
p231/p231_457|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p231/p231_349|What are they for?
p231/p231_421|There is a solution, she believes.
p231/p231_276|These figures are truly terrible.
p231/p231_046|I was inspired by two things.
p231/p231_300|But it is up again.
p231/p231_169|It is really good news.
p231/p231_348|Are they free?
p231/p231_212|Which isn't a bad idea.
p231/p231_049|There's nothing we could do about this.
p231/p231_035|I became a widow overnight.
p231/p231_173|I always felt they played for me.
p231/p231_240|It is now the big brother.
p231/p231_254|No production contract is yet in sight.
p231/p231_134|You're a gambling man.
p231/p231_232|She died in middle age.
p231/p231_171|To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
p231/p231_082|It's so hard to shift.
p231/p231_144|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p231/p231_130|It plans to return to this field.
p231/p231_354|Neither man has been charged.
p231/p231_278|The joint bid is still on course.
p231/p231_196|I came home by ambulance.
p231/p231_412|I will always remember the horrible images.
p231/p231_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p231/p231_247|Persuaded to change his mind.
p231/p231_255|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p231/p231_103|Why do it otherwise?
p231/p231_435|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p231/p231_087|It is an old family habit.
p231/p231_399|Clark is back on top form.
p231/p231_201|Does the name matter?
p231/p231_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p231/p231_299|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p231/p231_070|This is an exciting new venture.
p231/p231_461|They were good years for him.
p231/p231_450|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p231/p231_464|Driving has been the key.
p231/p231_281|They can leave at any time.
p231/p231_341|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p231/p231_307|You are a different people.
p231/p231_052|We have not given up hope.
p231/p231_444|It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
p231/p231_150|We have a clean bill of health.
p231/p231_145|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p231/p231_088|He's been hit by it.
p231/p231_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p231/p231_438|They are not left wing.
p231/p231_061|So is that it, then?
p231/p231_152|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p231/p231_374|There is no deal as yet.
p231/p231_153|He was asked to quit.
p231/p231_076|That would be too easy.
p231/p231_366|They should take their mobile phones.
p231/p231_326|That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
p231/p231_246|His is a global perspective.
p231/p231_093|We must stop it with the golf ball.
p231/p231_030|That deal is a joke.
p231/p231_280|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p231/p231_197|I suggest a new plan.
p231/p231_202|how do you get it back?
p231/p231_231|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p231/p231_193|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p231/p231_298|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p231/p231_133|It is a common problem.
p231/p231_102|It's not a quick fix.
p231/p231_104|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p231/p231_025|On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
p231/p231_059|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p231/p231_257|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p231/p231_262|And they were being paid?
p231/p231_449|And we might go back.
p231/p231_243|Nato was not a love affair.
p231/p231_386|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p231/p231_099|Two of the team became ill.
p231/p231_396|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p231/p231_313|I thought he did very well.
p231/p231_237|Hospitals are for the ill.
p231/p231_224|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p231/p231_417|He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
p231/p231_353|The units will not be replaced.
p231/p231_296|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p231/p231_261|I can't get a job.
p231/p231_263|was everything done to save people?
p231/p231_141|I miss the freedom that I had.
p231/p231_317|They come to enjoy themselves.
p231/p231_222|That you can do it.
p231/p231_092|Their attitude is all wrong.
p231/p231_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p231/p231_441|We shall not forget him.
p231/p231_147|The whole industry is a shambles.
p231/p231_053|The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
p231/p231_347|What form did that take?
p231/p231_359|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p231/p231_228|We played them off the pitch.
p231/p231_031|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p231/p231_235|The irony was not lost.
p231/p231_268|I've had the time of my life.
p231/p231_361|Glasgow is a friendly city.
p231/p231_203|What are you no good at?
p231/p231_033|It carried a double message.
p231/p231_170|We've made a couple of albums.
p231/p231_400|I had a fortunate war.
p231/p231_468|War is not the action.
p231/p231_401|She is in their hands.
p231/p231_270|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p231/p231_264|What was the matter for concern?
p231/p231_283|You get a lot for your money.
p231/p231_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p231/p231_389|That time may never be broken.
p231/p231_110|You'd better believe it.
p231/p231_447|We've got a good management record.
p231/p231_302|It could well be military.
p231/p231_116|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p231/p231_388|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p231/p231_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p231/p231_269|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p231/p231_140|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p231/p231_277|Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
p231/p231_329|The problems began a long time ago.
p231/p231_097|We should recognise others have done a good job.
p231/p231_154|A new school will be built.
p231/p231_086|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p231/p231_309|He is still in shock.
p231/p231_328|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p231/p231_249|This ruling is a farce.
p231/p231_369|Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
p231/p231_375|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p231/p231_056|Italy is a beautiful place.
p231/p231_260|The concerns are the same.
p231/p231_178|We are the gateway to justice.
p231/p231_325|Have a look at this lot.
p231/p231_105|So, did she meet him?
p231/p231_079|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p231/p231_162|Why change it?
p231/p231_288|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p231/p231_308|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p231/p231_214|He also presented You Bet!
p231/p231_286|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p231/p231_062|Do I have a favourite?
p231/p231_101|That time is not now, however.
p231/p231_210|It was worth a photograph.
p231/p231_469|However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
p231/p231_342|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p231/p231_367|You need a licence to run a pub.
p231/p231_294|Once again, they would be wrong.
p231/p231_151|It is not normal practice.
p231/p231_384|Does it matter?
p231/p231_291|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p231/p231_183|The shooting created panic in the street.
p231/p231_292|I've lost all confidence.
p231/p231_167|It is simply not true.
p231/p231_174|One season, they might do well.
p231/p231_165|We have a budget in March.
p231/p231_465|She has now been registered as disabled.
p231/p231_424|The road was closed for several hours.
p231/p231_323|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p231/p231_226|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p231/p231_295|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p231/p231_360|I've always been a sensitive.
p231/p231_256|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p231/p231_191|We represent a wide range of society.
p231/p231_159|What happened in that game?
p231/p231_271|I thought he might have been a bit.
p231/p231_242|She took them for a term.
p231/p231_378|to have products for their needs.
p231/p231_379|The pair are very much in love.
p231/p231_164|He was in great spirits.
p231/p231_301|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p231/p231_107|And does it?
p231/p231_312|I thought it was my only chance.
p231/p231_058|We should be able to cope.
p231/p231_218|I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p231/p231_069|We need to increase the membership.
p231/p231_063|What do we do?
p231/p231_245|You can feel at home in China.
p231/p231_474|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p231/p231_456|They have to be met.
p231/p231_072|Then followed a bout of flu.
p231/p231_149|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p231/p231_122|We should not be surprised.
p231/p231_100|No, the equipment is extra.
p231/p231_398|They have failed to deliver.
p231/p231_037|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p231/p231_303|I was just so determined.
p231/p231_259|It was the climax of the thing.
p231/p231_453|We put our bid in last night.
p231/p231_047|A win is a win.
p231/p231_121|I was just a child.
p231/p231_333|However, the groups denied the claims.
p231/p231_043|He looks like an Afghan.
p231/p231_029|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p231/p231_112|There's still plenty time left.
p231/p231_143|Anyone can do the sums.
p231/p231_436|There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
p231/p231_346|We are encouraged by the news.
p231/p231_078|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p231/p231_439|The British government does not want to know.
p231/p231_397|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p231/p231_109|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p231/p231_184|So many people will be affected by this.
p231/p231_188|This is the time to use it.
p231/p231_186|They need to look after themselves.
p231/p231_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p231/p231_089|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p231/p231_132|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p231/p231_146|It has become a way of life.
p231/p231_054|She said she was really sorry.
p231/p231_244|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p231/p231_343|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p231/p231_206|It gave no further details.
p231/p231_324|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p231/p231_330|I am not sure about the rate of progress.
p231/p231_071|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p231/p231_429|He is on the wrong side.
p231/p231_098|We live by the rule of law.
p231/p231_350|Is there a waiting list?
p231/p231_252|But they were never expected to last.
p231/p231_373|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p231/p231_230|They are the innocent victims.
p231/p231_305|The judge was really nice.
p231/p231_185|As many as the market will support.
p231/p231_095|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p231/p231_176|This much I can tell you.
p231/p231_422|Yet the data is compelling.
p231/p231_285|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p231/p231_273|I'd never run for them.
p231/p231_265|Do I think about them often?
p231/p231_258|It seems a shame to leave it.
p231/p231_340|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p231/p231_381|Had this been common practice?
p231/p231_181|I am not ready to walk away.
p231/p231_168|Well, this article is a bit like that.
p231/p231_251|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p231/p231_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p231/p231_220|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p231/p231_409|How do you take them away?
p231/p231_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p231/p231_216|I had decided to quit the show.
p231/p231_234|It is set in Paris.
p231/p231_158|It is not like us.
p231/p231_129|If not, a deal could take many months.
p231/p231_355|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p231/p231_001|Please call Stella.
p231/p231_387|I wanted to go out on a high.
p231/p231_434|But it can be done.
p231/p231_034|That means an extra two years.
p231/p231_239|My future is in the marathon.
p231/p231_166|You've been a great audience.
p231/p231_045|I guess I was lucky, though.
p231/p231_364|It is not real life.
p231/p231_408|I should think so, too.
p231/p231_051|We keep an eye on it.
p231/p231_194|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p231/p231_118|Then again, we could have.
p231/p231_418|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p231/p231_094|You are like an animal.
p231/p231_394|That's as good as it gets.
p231/p231_437|The growth potential is enormous.
p231/p231_157|He was right into football from an early age.
p231/p231_081|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p231/p231_368|We regret that they're brought in the first place.
p231/p231_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p231/p231_352|So what happens next?
p231/p231_420|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p231/p231_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p231/p231_345|Finally came the moment of truth.
p231/p231_337|The airport was even different.
p231/p231_332|In the old days, it was easy.
p231/p231_452|Its future is no longer in question.
p231/p231_199|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p231/p231_336|I think it's about time.
p231/p231_175|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p231/p231_073|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p231/p231_467|Classes must be reduced by half.
p231/p231_205|Who was she?
p231/p231_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p231/p231_136|He is a great addition to our team.
p231/p231_180|I have spoken to head office.
p231/p231_338|There was no time scale.
p231/p231_039|Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
p231/p231_172|My life has been destroyed.
p231/p231_473|It was clear on Thursday.
p231/p231_091|But I know the course.
p231/p231_225|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p231/p231_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p231/p231_406|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p231/p231_415|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p231/p231_221|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p231/p231_290|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p231/p231_131|They made such decisions in London.
p231/p231_314|I'm not making any comment at all.
p231/p231_282|That view has not altered.
p231/p231_267|Did he trip?
p231/p231_440|They said they were only young men.
p231/p231_117|It is much as it has been described.
p231/p231_198|It was a moment of madness.
p231/p231_044|He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
p231/p231_423|It was important to win the singles.
p231/p231_127|This should begin in October.
p231/p231_155|The strong pound also took its toll.
p231/p231_161|Was it the wife?
p231/p231_462|Let that be their memorial.
p231/p231_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p231/p231_040|Last year, I was pretty bad.
p231/p231_458|She has reached the top of her profession.
p231/p231_357|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p231/p231_266|Is it in the right place?
p231/p231_382|What do they want us to do?
p231/p231_125|That period was a struggle.
p231/p231_376|We were given a break.
p231/p231_217|He has a lot of skill.
p231/p231_209|We are a new department.
p231/p231_414|They are looking for profit.
p231/p231_443|They made a huge impression on me.
p231/p231_459|But he has a lifeline.
p231/p231_057|Four other charges were dropped.
p231/p231_371|The result is called a patent.
p231/p231_416|There is some light in the tunnel.
p231/p231_041|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p231/p231_067|Only water is currently allowed.
p231/p231_272|This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
p231/p231_236|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p231/p231_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p231/p231_393|But we are very near.
p231/p231_250|The baby deserves the credit.
p231/p231_466|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p231/p231_358|I am a lucky man.
p231/p231_066|We will pay their bills.
p231/p231_213|We have an election in eight days.
p231/p231_064|It was a lovely experience.
p231/p231_445|It sounded like a bomb.
p231/p231_189|You know the sort of thing.
p231/p231_380|We will win the argument.
p231/p231_442|The people are the hero.
p231/p231_042|Among them are many criminals.
p231/p231_126|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p231/p231_448|Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
p231/p231_083|They lived for their children.
p231/p231_233|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p231/p231_179|But one was not enough.
p231/p231_363|We live on an island.
p231/p231_274|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p231/p231_026|I'd just like to play.
p231/p231_111|New Year will be very busy.
p231/p231_472|He felt it was the right time.
p231/p231_470|It is too early to speculate.
p231/p231_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p231/p231_108|Before the game we went for a pint.
p231/p231_315|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p231/p231_038|The man became a reporter.
p231/p231_344|He was then replaced by Ross.
p231/p231_080|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p231/p231_289|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p231/p231_238|The minister is the engineer.
p231/p231_475|It was all in a short period of time.
p231/p231_190|I'm interested in interesting work.
p231/p231_320|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p231/p231_055|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p231/p231_402|It is a large number.
p231/p231_050|It is a symbolic concert.
p231/p231_195|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p231/p231_433|It is based on a true story.
p231/p231_331|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p231/p231_377|In due course the deal was done.
p231/p231_476|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p231/p231_405|It was a bank holiday, after all.
p231/p231_120|There were no grounds for his action.
p231/p231_327|The king is delighted by the honour.
p231/p231_229|So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
p231/p231_119|It is a delight on every level.
p231/p231_074|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p231/p231_163|What do we want to do that for?
p231/p231_404|It is hard to understand.
p231/p231_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p228/p228_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p228/p228_317|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p228/p228_220|I had decided to quit the show.
p228/p228_356|Equity declined to comment.
p228/p228_349|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p228/p228_217|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p228/p228_083|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p228/p228_149|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p228/p228_128|It is a delight on every level.
p228/p228_050|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p228/p228_367|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p228/p228_179|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p228/p228_057|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p228/p228_110|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p228/p228_098|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p228/p228_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p228/p228_219|She should not be blamed.
p228/p228_088|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p228/p228_139|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p228/p228_293|Our task is to complete the picture.
p228/p228_144|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p228/p228_286|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p228/p228_141|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p228/p228_034|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p228/p228_182|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p228/p228_265|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p228/p228_170|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p228/p228_370|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p228/p228_055|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p228/p228_227|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p228/p228_137|Who will attend?
p228/p228_306|Kids are terrible.
p228/p228_199|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p228/p228_267|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p228/p228_211|He had suffered a heart attack.
p228/p228_194|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p228/p228_294|They are wrong.
p228/p228_351|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p228/p228_115|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p228/p228_094|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p228/p228_085|But she might be.
p228/p228_113|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p228/p228_352|I expected these kind of questions.
p228/p228_266|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p228/p228_074|Painful, but only because it's true.
p228/p228_270|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p228/p228_304|It's not even finished.
p228/p228_097|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p228/p228_230|You take a risk.
p228/p228_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p228/p228_063|There was a battle there.
p228/p228_318|He was then replaced by Ross.
p228/p228_340|He's a genius.
p228/p228_001|Please call Stella.
p228/p228_242|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p228/p228_246|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p228/p228_123|It is so sad.
p228/p228_136|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p228/p228_337|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p228/p228_134|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p228/p228_175|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p228/p228_309|He said she was mad.
p228/p228_053|Here's a clue.
p228/p228_042|No meaningful response was issued.
p228/p228_096|It is an old family habit.
p228/p228_054|It had been in place since last July.
p228/p228_295|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p228/p228_181|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p228/p228_131|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p228/p228_176|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p228/p228_330|It is so unfair.
p228/p228_188|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p228/p228_114|They will want to perform well.
p228/p228_262|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p228/p228_300|We want to play at the worlds.
p228/p228_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p228/p228_206|They are in the euro.
p228/p228_158|The weather forecast isn't good.
p228/p228_281|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p228/p228_058|That's the truth.
p228/p228_178|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p228/p228_154|I am just trying to do my job.
p228/p228_173|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p228/p228_146|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p228/p228_117|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p228/p228_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p228/p228_145|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p228/p228_355|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p228/p228_264|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p228/p228_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p228/p228_280|We want to see the maximum of change.
p228/p228_129|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p228/p228_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p228/p228_315|It's not long enough.
p228/p228_359|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p228/p228_321|Robert is a special talent.
p228/p228_157|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p228/p228_052|He looks like an Afghan.
p228/p228_365|So there, we won.
p228/p228_043|It is urgent.
p228/p228_025|It's nice to hear.
p228/p228_099|It is annoying.
p228/p228_250|I can't get a job.
p228/p228_269|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p228/p228_037|Indeed, he does.
p228/p228_231|He is severe.
p228/p228_148|It is difficult for Ali.
p228/p228_345|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p228/p228_292|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p228/p228_362|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p228/p228_290|Graeme was prepared.
p228/p228_329|The train was on time.
p228/p228_102|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p228/p228_167|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p228/p228_325|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p228/p228_235|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p228/p228_068|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p228/p228_214|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p228/p228_070|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p228/p228_092|Today I couldn't run on it.
p228/p228_331|He has to learn.
p228/p228_200|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p228/p228_076|It's all I can do.
p228/p228_077|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p228/p228_172|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p228/p228_241|It's only fair.
p228/p228_079|I had my suspicions.
p228/p228_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p228/p228_243|You can feel at home in China.
p228/p228_327|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p228/p228_277|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p228/p228_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p228/p228_116|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p228/p228_212|A deadline is still essential.
p228/p228_252|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p228/p228_086|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p228/p228_350|As, indeed, they would be.
p228/p228_120|I don't want to use the term.
p228/p228_066|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p228/p228_105|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p228/p228_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p228/p228_124|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p228/p228_215|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p228/p228_067|An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
p228/p228_205|I have a cold.
p228/p228_361|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p228/p228_207|Ferguson should take note.
p228/p228_084|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p228/p228_177|We've made a couple of albums.
p228/p228_343|It's the last thing on my mind.
p228/p228_208|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p228/p228_089|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p228/p228_168|I've put my own money into this project.
p228/p228_192|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p228/p228_272|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p228/p228_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p228/p228_163|I was in daily contact.
p228/p228_143|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p228/p228_347|She is free.
p228/p228_150|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p228/p228_108|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p228/p228_324|There was no option.
p228/p228_301|We have waited a long time for this.
p228/p228_297|You are the glory.
p228/p228_260|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p228/p228_303|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p228/p228_093|However, it did not end that way.
p228/p228_065|It's that kind of place.
p228/p228_299|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p228/p228_125|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p228/p228_222|It's been a good year.
p228/p228_369|There is no signature.
p228/p228_156|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p228/p228_056|That's the day job.
p228/p228_183|The hotel was now for sale.
p228/p228_197|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p228/p228_283|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p228/p228_031|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p228/p228_245|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p228/p228_159|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p228/p228_147|Who would be right?
p228/p228_360|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p228/p228_271|It's a way of life.
p228/p228_236|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p228/p228_039|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p228/p228_239|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p228/p228_353|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p228/p228_142|He was in a great deal of pain.
p228/p228_346|That is a break with tradition.
p228/p228_341|They should take their mobile phones.
p228/p228_257|Is that a serious question?
p228/p228_029|I feel I did not have enough time.
p228/p228_348|Everyone was in tears.
p228/p228_229|It's so special.
p228/p228_059|That is very hard, alone.
p228/p228_118|Further protests are likely.
p228/p228_169|Eight months later, he was dead.
p228/p228_189|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p228/p228_228|It is a gamble.
p228/p228_030|Life was like a timetable.
p228/p228_276|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p228/p228_153|It is not just about pay.
p228/p228_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p228/p228_223|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p228/p228_046|We need to chat.
p228/p228_289|The home was now under new management.
p228/p228_213|Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
p228/p228_104|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p228/p228_132|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p228/p228_095|Safety was also an issue.
p228/p228_344|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p228/p228_333|I've got no secret.
p228/p228_193|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p228/p228_259|They must play for each other.
p228/p228_218|That is an important part of our role.
p228/p228_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p228/p228_061|Four other charges were dropped.
p228/p228_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p228/p228_087|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p228/p228_198|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p228/p228_100|We could not get any possession.
p228/p228_249|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p228/p228_111|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p228/p228_060|He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
p228/p228_308|This film will be totally awesome.
p228/p228_357|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p228/p228_044|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p228/p228_160|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p228/p228_248|It was a hit.
p228/p228_320|My first concern is for the safety of the public.
p228/p228_152|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p228/p228_106|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p228/p228_279|He will address the nation this evening.
p228/p228_069|He is a young man with a new deal.
p228/p228_135|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p228/p228_165|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p228/p228_048|The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
p228/p228_162|It was by the numbers.
p228/p228_184|I drove the ball well.
p228/p228_187|They will run a mile.
p228/p228_204|Is that success?
p228/p228_364|It is a simple equation.
p228/p228_368|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p228/p228_334|Tiger is the exception.
p228/p228_033|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p228/p228_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p228/p228_221|His third goal was superb.
p228/p228_216|That will be vital.
p228/p228_224|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p228/p228_195|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p228/p228_062|They're appalled by that.
p228/p228_313|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p228/p228_366|But I managed.
p228/p228_258|They are real.
p228/p228_296|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p228/p228_316|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p228/p228_335|A great deal has been achieved.
p228/p228_209|Who will pay for this?
p228/p228_261|His contract was then not renewed.
p228/p228_284|It changed my life.
p228/p228_278|All options are open.
p228/p228_035|It was clear.
p228/p228_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p228/p228_140|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p228/p228_371|It became a national network.
p228/p228_127|They've got to account for it.
p228/p228_072|Try to save us.
p228/p228_247|He's a lovely young man.
p228/p228_319|Is that an issue?
p228/p228_133|This plan is an agenda for action.
p228/p228_121|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p228/p228_232|We just had a go.
p228/p228_082|Today she has been released.
p228/p228_090|Now the system is right behind us.
p228/p228_328|It has moved on in the last week.
p228/p228_311|I am very happy to be here.
p228/p228_307|The problems began a long time ago.
p228/p228_138|We had a reunion last week.
p228/p228_071|The script was funny.
p228/p228_237|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p228/p228_225|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p228/p228_174|The post will be unpaid.
p228/p228_288|It became a book by itself.
p228/p228_166|It was so new, so exciting.
p228/p228_302|Is there on his hands?
p228/p228_185|I took the gun.
p228/p228_186|We knew nothing about it.
p228/p228_226|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p228/p228_119|It's in his blood.
p228/p228_026|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p228/p228_041|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p228/p228_151|That should do it.
p228/p228_268|I was rubbish.
p228/p228_342|It is not like working for a living.
p228/p228_254|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p228/p228_298|It's certainly different.
p228/p228_323|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p228/p228_032|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p228/p228_091|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p228/p228_291|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p228/p228_287|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p228/p228_354|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p228/p228_190|Miller was every bit as happy.
p228/p228_171|We have to move forward.
p228/p228_155|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p228/p228_101|I love the Dome.
p228/p228_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p228/p228_251|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p228/p228_332|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p228/p228_282|He was obviously very genuine.
p228/p228_047|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p228/p228_202|It's the same old story.
p228/p228_130|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p228/p228_210|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p228/p228_027|Because we do not need it.
p228/p228_310|There was some merit in that.
p228/p228_028|There's a story, too.
p228/p228_240|She was well balanced.
p228/p228_049|But it might have done.
p228/p228_164|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p228/p228_358|The play is based on a real-life event.
p228/p228_051|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p228/p228_363|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p228/p228_312|We do the same.
p228/p228_112|We have an election in eight days.
p228/p228_256|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p228/p228_078|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p228/p228_285|The songs are just so good.
p228/p228_045|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p228/p228_234|We were a load of rubbish.
p228/p228_107|It is a good day for the coalition.
p228/p228_073|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p228/p228_126|Who would be a referee?
p228/p228_191|I put the drawing down.
p228/p228_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p228/p228_180|One season, they might do well.
p228/p228_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p228/p228_081|People must remain vigilant.
p228/p228_275|They were too hard.
p228/p228_326|It is a sign of hope.
p228/p228_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p228/p228_263|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p228/p228_255|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p228/p228_161|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p228/p228_122|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p228/p228_103|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p228/p228_253|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p228/p228_322|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p228/p228_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p228/p228_109|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p228/p228_040|My whole life has changed.
p228/p228_064|Scotland had great assets.
p228/p228_036|The problem is the pitch.
p228/p228_305|We are a peaceful people.
p228/p228_274|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p228/p228_233|We are in the hat.
p228/p228_196|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p228/p228_244|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p228/p228_339|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p228/p228_203|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p228/p228_238|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p228/p228_336|It was forced to divert.
p228/p228_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p228/p228_038|President Bush is at war.
p228/p228_075|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p228/p228_338|This is a friendly match?
p253/p253_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p253/p253_299|It could work.
p253/p253_410|Is there any prospect of this happening?
p253/p253_180|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p253/p253_042|Dancing was her life.
p253/p253_212|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p253/p253_250|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p253/p253_148|It is not just about pay.
p253/p253_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p253/p253_031|He was jailed for five years.
p253/p253_382|It's just outrageous.
p253/p253_152|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p253/p253_366|It was a funny game.
p253/p253_047|You had better believe it.
p253/p253_197|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p253/p253_296|They are wrong.
p253/p253_089|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p253/p253_281|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p253/p253_154|They have not been named.
p253/p253_192|We speak about the performance.
p253/p253_276|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p253/p253_238|It is hard won.
p253/p253_220|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p253/p253_162|Was this element always there?
p253/p253_360|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p253/p253_282|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p253/p253_266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p253/p253_131|I am now unemployed.
p253/p253_320|Is there a new way forward?
p253/p253_054|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p253/p253_356|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p253/p253_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p253/p253_330|I've got no secret.
p253/p253_324|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p253/p253_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p253/p253_383|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p253/p253_357|Their time has gone.
p253/p253_345|As, indeed, they would be.
p253/p253_163|These days are long gone.
p253/p253_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p253/p253_304|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p253/p253_332|This is a friendly match?
p253/p253_336|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p253/p253_198|Is that success?
p253/p253_235|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p253/p253_400|The weekly average was three hours.
p253/p253_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p253/p253_130|No production was achieved.
p253/p253_253|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p253/p253_337|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p253/p253_033|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p253/p253_226|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p253/p253_079|People must remain vigilant.
p253/p253_364|It is a simple equation.
p253/p253_216|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p253/p253_248|That could be in place by next year.
p253/p253_057|I was lost.
p253/p253_202|Sadly, it can't.
p253/p253_230|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p253/p253_107|It was an adventure.
p253/p253_136|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p253/p253_331|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p253/p253_323|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p253/p253_211|Work has started.
p253/p253_064|That's the truth.
p253/p253_397|What would be the point?
p253/p253_258|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p253/p253_138|I was dead.
p253/p253_084|I first met him last summer.
p253/p253_096|He's been hit by it.
p253/p253_271|She failed in her action.
p253/p253_328|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p253/p253_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p253/p253_283|Who will perform?
p253/p253_262|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p253/p253_351|My husband was angry.
p253/p253_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p253/p253_183|They need to look after themselves.
p253/p253_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p253/p253_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p253/p253_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p253/p253_237|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p253/p253_189|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p253/p253_158|Words were not required.
p253/p253_236|The minister is the engineer.
p253/p253_025|But it failed.
p253/p253_341|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p253/p253_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p253/p253_056|Here's a clue.
p253/p253_234|It's quite a line-up!
p253/p253_117|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p253/p253_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p253/p253_277|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p253/p253_350|That would help.
p253/p253_343|Yet he left a few days later.
p253/p253_061|It is unique.
p253/p253_355|This is a club on the rise.
p253/p253_403|went on sale.
p253/p253_171|You had to go and see him.
p253/p253_139|I don't know the full story.
p253/p253_371|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p253/p253_240|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p253/p253_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p253/p253_099|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p253/p253_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p253/p253_252|they fail to engage.
p253/p253_206|Feel the heat?
p253/p253_264|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p253/p253_346|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p253/p253_067|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p253/p253_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p253/p253_201|It's all about money, money, money.
p253/p253_093|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p253/p253_065|It seems to have worked.
p253/p253_196|I came home by ambulance.
p253/p253_104|That would be unlawful.
p253/p253_060|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p253/p253_239|Our policy is clear.
p253/p253_268|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p253/p253_317|Our message was inclusive.
p253/p253_147|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p253/p253_294|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p253/p253_129|It's not a U-turn.
p253/p253_307|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p253/p253_385|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p253/p253_126|I'm so angry.
p253/p253_085|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p253/p253_394|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p253/p253_149|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p253/p253_199|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p253/p253_150|There was a substantial explosion.
p253/p253_113|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p253/p253_073|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p253/p253_132|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p253/p253_344|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p253/p253_151|I was stunned.
p253/p253_359|The death rates are still as high.
p253/p253_229|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p253/p253_314|It will work.
p253/p253_036|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p253/p253_301|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p253/p253_032|Help is needed.
p253/p253_207|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p253/p253_305|The letters are going out today.
p253/p253_135|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p253/p253_274|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p253/p253_142|He realises his mistake.
p253/p253_223|It's not before time.
p253/p253_287|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p253/p253_124|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p253/p253_066|This is the first step.
p253/p253_221|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p253/p253_053|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p253/p253_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p253/p253_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p253/p253_179|The goals were good.
p253/p253_161|Well, he should know.
p253/p253_114|It's a shame.
p253/p253_261|He has not created a Festival resource.
p253/p253_092|We are on the path of change.
p253/p253_285|Who did the recruiting?
p253/p253_367|There wasn't a goal.
p253/p253_153|The weather forecast isn't good.
p253/p253_103|Two of the team became ill.
p253/p253_170|We should do everything at a stroke.
p253/p253_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p253/p253_354|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p253/p253_340|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p253/p253_298|There were no passengers on board.
p253/p253_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p253/p253_247|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p253/p253_228|My wife and family are the support system.
p253/p253_373|Something is wrong.
p253/p253_249|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p253/p253_241|The scene is about this?
p253/p253_270|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p253/p253_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p253/p253_168|I was in the train station overnight.
p253/p253_100|It is a love affair.
p253/p253_030|This is the window.
p253/p253_377|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p253/p253_156|My Dad is a hero.
p253/p253_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p253/p253_184|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p253/p253_044|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p253/p253_242|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p253/p253_173|In a way he was.
p253/p253_112|Is that right?
p253/p253_034|It is marvellous.
p253/p253_072|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p253/p253_361|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p253/p253_146|Who would have?
p253/p253_110|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p253/p253_181|It's an idea.
p253/p253_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p253/p253_182|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p253/p253_119|It is rubbish.
p253/p253_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p253/p253_049|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p253/p253_046|It's the only thing.
p253/p253_222|I'd never seen a play about me.
p253/p253_083|He is in the queue.
p253/p253_077|It is a job creation scheme.
p253/p253_338|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p253/p253_369|Colour was at the core of his life.
p253/p253_176|As we worked.
p253/p253_327|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p253/p253_280|Dialogue is the key.
p253/p253_309|She is very distinctive.
p253/p253_141|She died at her home.
p253/p253_195|It's a fact.
p253/p253_273|She looked so young.
p253/p253_218|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p253/p253_080|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p253/p253_215|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p253/p253_186|Does this matter?
p253/p253_265|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p253/p253_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p253/p253_391|It will take place in July.
p253/p253_227|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p253/p253_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p253/p253_316|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p253/p253_243|My son was too young to die.
p253/p253_311|You may have a short memory.
p253/p253_339|She is free.
p253/p253_375|That's the name of the game, though.
p253/p253_208|Twaddle is a case in point.
p253/p253_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p253/p253_269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p253/p253_302|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p253/p253_289|I was brought up in a mining background.
p253/p253_125|There were no grounds for his action.
p253/p253_145|I was awful.
p253/p253_133|It plans to return to this field.
p253/p253_232|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p253/p253_384|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p253/p253_257|There's not much money in cycling.
p253/p253_408|It is legally binding.
p253/p253_203|It was worth a photograph.
p253/p253_087|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p253/p253_086|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p253/p253_275|It's so awful.
p253/p253_288|I was the sheep.
p253/p253_167|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p253/p253_256|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p253/p253_075|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p253/p253_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p253/p253_091|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p253/p253_097|I love the Dome.
p253/p253_190|It caused a lot of upset.
p253/p253_372|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p253/p253_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p253/p253_200|Who will pay for this?
p253/p253_106|Oil embargo endorsed.
p253/p253_244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p253/p253_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p253/p253_164|I'd love to be like Peter.
p253/p253_263|He was also married with two children.
p253/p253_175|Blair's response was weak.
p253/p253_120|Who would be a referee?
p253/p253_037|They're just different.
p253/p253_381|It's a real problem.
p253/p253_278|You've got to have both sides.
p253/p253_255|They must play for each other.
p253/p253_134|We work well together.
p253/p253_191|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p253/p253_062|I expect a rapid response.
p253/p253_102|They make a selective perception process.
p253/p253_078|The party is up for it.
p253/p253_319|Feel the air, the space.
p253/p253_063|It happened so quickly.
p253/p253_297|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p253/p253_140|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p253/p253_051|It is bizarre.
p253/p253_160|Life becomes a song.
p253/p253_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p253/p253_069|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p253/p253_300|This is a war over our home.
p253/p253_392|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p253/p253_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p253/p253_111|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p253/p253_409|We went straight into the bedroom.
p253/p253_352|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p253/p253_303|You should be.
p253/p253_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p253/p253_169|We have a budget in March.
p253/p253_059|My fitness was very poor.
p253/p253_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p253/p253_322|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p253/p253_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p253/p253_209|It had all been arranged.
p253/p253_358|He could make it.
p253/p253_081|What has changed?
p253/p253_376|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p253/p253_219|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p253/p253_279|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p253/p253_290|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p253/p253_407|That may be.
p253/p253_402|He got his degree.
p253/p253_387|They are good.
p253/p253_045|They want to be entertained.
p253/p253_225|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p253/p253_128|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p253/p253_001|Please call Stella.
p253/p253_043|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p253/p253_188|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p253/p253_231|We are so proud.
p253/p253_380|Yet the data is compelling.
p253/p253_245|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p253/p253_313|We are in the end game.
p253/p253_308|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p253/p253_187|Our team is just so young.
p253/p253_144|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p253/p253_039|Indeed, he does.
p253/p253_076|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p253/p253_177|We are the gateway to justice.
p253/p253_088|They lived for their children.
p253/p253_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p253/p253_378|Does that put pressure on us?
p253/p253_115|It was the eighties.
p253/p253_260|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p253/p253_335|They should take their mobile phones.
p253/p253_318|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p253/p253_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p253/p253_071|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p253/p253_185|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p253/p253_205|We have an election in eight days.
p253/p253_390|I've had my time.
p253/p253_122|We enjoyed it today.
p253/p253_374|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p253/p253_251|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p253/p253_233|Of course I was tempted.
p253/p253_074|It could take some time.
p253/p253_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p253/p253_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p253/p253_048|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p253/p253_194|Peace was won.
p253/p253_329|Two people were interviewed.
p253/p253_143|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p253/p253_123|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p253/p253_068|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p253/p253_342|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p253/p253_116|It is so sad.
p253/p253_326|Three years ago he would have been.
p253/p253_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p253/p253_127|She really suffered for her art.
p253/p253_224|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p253/p253_038|It was clear.
p253/p253_405|Until they came to do it.
p253/p253_095|Yet, it worked.
p253/p253_217|Then another one came.
p253/p253_293|One was a lawyer.
p253/p253_052|There is no reason at all.
p253/p253_401|Relief was beyond belief.
p253/p253_368|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p253/p253_050|A neighbour said.
p253/p253_310|We have got to get the points from this one.
p253/p253_379|At the last I found a bunker.
p253/p253_399|It might be.
p253/p253_291|Nothing is safe.
p253/p253_388|I'm glad I came.
p253/p253_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p253/p253_118|The mood is upbeat.
p253/p253_404|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p253/p253_349|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p253/p253_178|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p253/p253_055|Our people are ready.
p253/p253_082|I will miss him.
p253/p253_292|But it's a subtle process.
p253/p253_267|One knows the feeling.
p253/p253_121|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p253/p253_386|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p253/p253_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p253/p253_157|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p253/p253_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p314/p314_128|Police were also perplexed.
p314/p314_278|Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
p314/p314_332|No, no, it's not what you think.
p314/p314_193|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p314/p314_167|Little Voice is on general release.
p314/p314_089|He had a moustache.
p314/p314_236|Both sides have to step back.
p314/p314_408|There is no smoking gun.
p314/p314_397|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p314/p314_118|He would just say it was terrible.
p314/p314_132|That's a huge amount.
p314/p314_045|He will emerge as a world leader.
p314/p314_180|I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
p314/p314_196|We will reform the welfare state.
p314/p314_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p314/p314_212|But he was a full, working member of our staff.
p314/p314_283|Nothing can bring back their son.
p314/p314_220|She was an only child.
p314/p314_367|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p314/p314_347|They are the heroes.
p314/p314_289|I'm not putting myself down.
p314/p314_121|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p314/p314_273|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p314/p314_387|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p314/p314_029|Four other charges were dropped.
p314/p314_213|I am a little bit tired.
p314/p314_248|EMI is a prime example.
p314/p314_280|This is my home town.
p314/p314_038|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p314/p314_065|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p314/p314_202|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p314/p314_240|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p314/p314_384|I am not obsessed with sex.
p314/p314_146|Now we look forward to it.
p314/p314_126|But then he changed his mind.
p314/p314_131|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p314/p314_040|We have reacted well to each other.
p314/p314_314|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p314/p314_409|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p314/p314_368|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p314/p314_056|Sub Not Used, MacKay.
p314/p314_415|Jackson may well be right.
p314/p314_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p314/p314_116|Which perhaps is just as well.
p314/p314_369|It looks like paradise.
p314/p314_399|Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
p314/p314_355|The home was now under new management.
p314/p314_235|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p314/p314_410|He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
p314/p314_079|I go home only once.
p314/p314_157|It's all too short term.
p314/p314_053|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p314/p314_188|It was a disaster of a race.
p314/p314_150|It was a moment of madness.
p314/p314_269|They've been at it for five hours.
p314/p314_232|The next one comes up.
p314/p314_092|He said because people had invited him.
p314/p314_311|Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
p314/p314_135|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p314/p314_172|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p314/p314_185|It was an empowering journey.
p314/p314_066|They were later discharged from hospital.
p314/p314_353|It took more than two years.
p314/p314_403|Friends of the family have given their support.
p314/p314_345|With us, we just want them to respond.
p314/p314_364|Now it has become a big picture.
p314/p314_395|The home team had an amazing start.
p314/p314_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p314/p314_224|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p314/p314_234|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p314/p314_258|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p314/p314_404|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p314/p314_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p314/p314_379|There were three boys and two girls.
p314/p314_261|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p314/p314_252|A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
p314/p314_330|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p314/p314_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p314/p314_394|I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
p314/p314_134|I'm not holding the club to ransom.
p314/p314_243|I was just getting over the time difference.
p314/p314_251|You cannot allow it to go on.
p314/p314_310|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p314/p314_073|You can't go on forever.
p314/p314_372|We were short of athletes.
p314/p314_298|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p314/p314_222|They should come forward.
p314/p314_216|I looked forward to it.
p314/p314_293|I am just trying to do my job.
p314/p314_137|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p314/p314_071|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p314/p314_233|This fact is supported by audience research.
p314/p314_272|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p314/p314_238|Is he going to look after them?
p314/p314_145|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p314/p314_178|It's just a normal life.
p314/p314_214|Broke the birdie record.
p314/p314_335|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p314/p314_301|Check that he is dead.
p314/p314_360|There is no openness.
p314/p314_331|You have to think not.
p314/p314_262|Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
p314/p314_189|It's not unlike the millennium bug.
p314/p314_191|They had been together for about three years.
p314/p314_221|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p314/p314_186|Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
p314/p314_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p314/p314_133|The final stage is paranoia.
p314/p314_373|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p314/p314_416|I am in a very difficult position.
p314/p314_076|I have got a knife.
p314/p314_422|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p314/p314_078|What did we learn?
p314/p314_380|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p314/p314_130|It's very tragic and traumatic.
p314/p314_342|His job was not advertised.
p314/p314_149|He was telling me to keep quiet.
p314/p314_294|I don't think we could have expected better.
p314/p314_287|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p314/p314_354|There is access for disabled people.
p314/p314_413|Whether this return was too soon.
p314/p314_299|I just want to change my life.
p314/p314_254|A friendship that will endure.
p314/p314_087|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p314/p314_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p314/p314_161|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p314/p314_344|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p314/p314_108|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p314/p314_160|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p314/p314_184|There is no way to do this.
p314/p314_069|They knew they shouldn't have been there.
p314/p314_356|We don't want to push him.
p314/p314_211|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p314/p314_362|It's being very carefully looked at.
p314/p314_173|We've got the top three.
p314/p314_123|It is a great shame.
p314/p314_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p314/p314_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p314/p314_266|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p314/p314_291|There is great demand for human cloning.
p314/p314_101|He was the deputy editor at the paper.
p314/p314_001|Please call Stella.
p314/p314_282|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p314/p314_151|Don't even bother applying.
p314/p314_316|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p314/p314_223|We don't say there was a massacre.
p314/p314_406|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p314/p314_312|That only came out during a radio interview.
p314/p314_247|The death toll included five children.
p314/p314_195|Our customers come first.
p314/p314_290|That is highly unfair.
p314/p314_190|No, it's never been mentioned.
p314/p314_096|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p314/p314_270|I'm not talking about his career.
p314/p314_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p314/p314_275|He has lost confidence and weight.
p314/p314_284|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p314/p314_276|Intensive care has been very busy.
p314/p314_181|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p314/p314_414|I don't believe that money is the answer.
p314/p314_407|The review has been conducted fairly.
p314/p314_026|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p314/p314_259|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p314/p314_107|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p314/p314_054|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p314/p314_205|Do you come from Moscow?
p314/p314_104|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p314/p314_363|It was a job he loved.
p314/p314_303|He is also a great finisher.
p314/p314_136|Folk music is in her blood.
p314/p314_109|That is nearly four people every day.
p314/p314_094|They are completely different from each other.
p314/p314_390|It was early morning.
p314/p314_359|One was a lawyer.
p314/p314_072|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p314/p314_348|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p314/p314_090|He has changed my life for ever.
p314/p314_206|He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
p314/p314_086|The team this year is going places.
p314/p314_338|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p314/p314_358|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p314/p314_382|There is a job to be done.
p314/p314_049|All the oil companies are talking together.
p314/p314_377|Only local people are helping.
p314/p314_396|We can make changes.
p314/p314_244|I don't have any answer for them.
p314/p314_117|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p314/p314_112|It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
p314/p314_279|It could be a danger.
p314/p314_171|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p314/p314_103|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p314/p314_192|O Neill has delivered.
p314/p314_143|My duty is to win.
p314/p314_200|The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
p314/p314_420|My thoughts are with their families.
p314/p314_295|You take a risk.
p314/p314_218|I'd come back from London.
p314/p314_095|The money is not really our concern.
p314/p314_082|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p314/p314_378|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p314/p314_318|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p314/p314_080|I'm not going to answer that right now.
p314/p314_264|He is young but not too young.
p314/p314_097|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p314/p314_203|We just want to get stuck in now.
p314/p314_060|What happens next?
p314/p314_215|We have an attorney on the ground.
p314/p314_183|He is the example for all of us.
p314/p314_419|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p314/p314_031|We are just being flooded.
p314/p314_260|I am deeply sorry they did.
p314/p314_177|This will secure the future of our industry.
p314/p314_209|You saw the football.
p314/p314_401|The best option is to destroy the plants.
p314/p314_144|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p314/p314_158|It is believed she had serious head injuries.
p314/p314_226|That is not an easy thing.
p314/p314_398|The conclusion is enthralling.
p314/p314_204|Drugs are getting through.
p314/p314_423|How come it is so often unnoticed?
p314/p314_129|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p314/p314_371|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p314/p314_034|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p314/p314_241|Obviously, we would want to look at this.
p314/p314_138|They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
p314/p314_386|I can't believe what has happened.
p314/p314_044|In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
p314/p314_099|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p314/p314_088|We should do everything at a stroke.
p314/p314_417|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p314/p314_075|So far this season this approach is working.
p314/p314_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p314/p314_327|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p314/p314_047|I only half believe it.
p314/p314_265|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p314/p314_326|He will address the nation this evening.
p314/p314_365|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p314/p314_058|But he just carried on anyway.
p314/p314_091|It plans to return to this field.
p314/p314_317|Neither was involved in violence.
p314/p314_032|It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
p314/p314_170|They've got to get better.
p314/p314_110|There are nine people here now.
p314/p314_402|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p314/p314_370|This means a great deal to the families.
p314/p314_336|Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
p314/p314_106|These guys will not lie down.
p314/p314_323|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p314/p314_297|Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
p314/p314_037|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p314/p314_229|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p314/p314_383|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p314/p314_050|We have no choice but to shut down.
p314/p314_388|You do that because you want to win.
p314/p314_267|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p314/p314_400|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p314/p314_319|Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p314/p314_306|This is too much like Scotland.
p314/p314_165|I should not be able to stand.
p314/p314_242|We are ready for the long haul.
p314/p314_352|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p314/p314_155|But we are not immune to the problem.
p314/p314_274|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p314/p314_048|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p314/p314_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p314/p314_114|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p314/p314_334|Scotland were beaten again.
p314/p314_302|CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
p314/p314_320|I am not among its admirers.
p314/p314_164|The elections should have no role in this.
p314/p314_374|The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
p314/p314_122|But the killer remains at large.
p314/p314_389|At this level, you have all to perform well.
p314/p314_111|Is my wife a racist?
p314/p314_376|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p314/p314_405|You name it, they have it.
p314/p314_339|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p314/p314_346|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p314/p314_084|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p314/p314_070|These findings would be made public.
p314/p314_063|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p314/p314_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p314/p314_042|It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
p314/p314_115|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p314/p314_176|That nation is South Africa.
p314/p314_043|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p314/p314_051|I'm feeling pretty good.
p314/p314_064|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p314/p314_125|But it will backfire.
p314/p314_357|I like what has happened!
p314/p314_227|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p314/p314_333|This is a national crisis.
p314/p314_074|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p314/p314_308|A counter reaction was.
p314/p314_199|Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
p314/p314_245|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p314/p314_313|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p314/p314_119|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p314/p314_255|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p314/p314_152|But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
p314/p314_039|His concern is only for the future.
p314/p314_139|We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
p314/p314_187|I certainly do not agree with that.
p314/p314_249|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p314/p314_041|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p314/p314_421|He is not very big, either.
p314/p314_322|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p314/p314_027|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p314/p314_142|That's the sort of game you want.
p314/p314_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p314/p314_093|Action must be taken urgently.
p314/p314_328|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p314/p314_305|He knew it would cost him millions.
p314/p314_198|His director of football is leaving.
p314/p314_163|I'd say we should give it a week.
p314/p314_166|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p314/p314_288|The alliance said it may not wait.
p314/p314_349|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p314/p314_175|There is no substitute.
p314/p314_208|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p314/p314_035|Well, what do you know?
p314/p314_281|His English counterpart agreed.
p314/p314_257|That will not change.
p314/p314_083|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p314/p314_237|This is wonderful news.
p314/p314_246|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p314/p314_250|And what is she escaping from?
p314/p314_141|This is the high point of my career.
p314/p314_159|We must move on.
p314/p314_148|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p314/p314_036|But she was very human.
p314/p314_351|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p314/p314_225|The island will never recover.
p314/p314_337|The whole thing would be perfect.
p314/p314_113|This would not be my first choice.
p314/p314_304|This club have been fair to me.
p314/p314_341|She had been sexually assaulted.
p314/p314_124|There are a lot of examples.
p314/p314_375|We want to keep the pound.
p314/p314_219|That it is a brand name.
p314/p314_068|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p314/p314_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p314/p314_307|He's been here on numerous occasions.
p314/p314_028|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p314/p314_174|I was never alone with her, right?
p314/p314_062|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p314/p314_077|If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
p314/p314_169|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p314/p314_418|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p314/p314_025|The Scots are, however, in good company.
p314/p314_127|I really hope he thinks that through.
p314/p314_268|I took a minibus into town.
p314/p314_207|That night was a terrible muddle.
p314/p314_197|It may be his last for a while, too.
p314/p314_154|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p314/p314_147|There is no such thing.
p314/p314_277|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p314/p314_315|We are now setting about finding them.
p314/p314_393|There must be boundaries.
p314/p314_324|I'll tell you honestly.
p314/p314_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p314/p314_059|The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
p314/p314_381|He had no answer.
p314/p314_300|A statement is expected in April.
p314/p314_228|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p314/p314_030|I believe in the Church.
p314/p314_067|Let's see that increase over the years.
p314/p314_366|But let's not get carried away.
p314/p314_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p314/p314_321|Hitches can be expected.
p314/p314_329|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p314/p314_156|Racism has no place in any sport.
p314/p314_140|I would love it.
p314/p314_285|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p314/p314_102|The proposal was rejected.
p314/p314_085|Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
p314/p314_239|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p314/p314_210|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p314/p314_361|We are still going ahead with our plans.
p314/p314_098|I came up through the ranks.
p314/p314_153|We like being the underdogs.
p314/p314_391|Partition is not an option.
p314/p314_033|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p314/p314_292|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p314/p314_194|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p314/p314_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p314/p314_230|It is a court case.
p314/p314_217|That was a disgraceful performance.
p314/p314_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p314/p314_343|The event has now gone to Helsinki.
p314/p314_325|Dialogue is the key.
p314/p314_340|However, we had no failures on our side.
p314/p314_271|I watched a game.
p314/p314_412|It is a natural reaction.
p314/p314_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p314/p314_263|Who would have thought it?
p314/p314_179|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p314/p314_057|It is not normal practice.
p314/p314_309|He said he was sorry.
p314/p314_231|She was a delightful person.
p314/p314_296|What are you going to do exactly?
p314/p314_052|The prognosis is excellent.
p314/p314_411|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p314/p314_081|It had a gigantic effect.
p314/p314_168|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p314/p314_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p314/p314_046|That view has not altered.
p314/p314_385|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p314/p314_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p314/p314_182|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p314/p314_253|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p314/p314_105|That would be even more disastrous.
p314/p314_100|His team management was protective.
p314/p314_286|Some may end up in hospital.
p314/p314_120|That's not fair to the supporters.
p314/p314_256|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p314/p314_201|He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
p314/p314_162|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p314/p314_350|This seems like a very good idea.
p314/p314_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p314/p314_055|It was developed in the Gulf War.
p314/p314_061|I would not want to be young again.
p314/p314_392|We've been treated with complete contempt.
p304/p304_104|Four people died instantly.
p304/p304_305|I can't say that this is very usual.
p304/p304_097|But he's not afraid to take risks.
p304/p304_262|I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
p304/p304_390|Changes need to be made.
p304/p304_309|As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
p304/p304_184|An announcement is expected today on their future.
p304/p304_299|He will feel the pain again.
p304/p304_225|I see no reason for them to be.
p304/p304_406|The baby deserves the credit.
p304/p304_040|He is dying from cancer.
p304/p304_163|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p304/p304_063|No details were disclosed.
p304/p304_073|Clearly, there will have to be changes.
p304/p304_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p304/p304_123|It was a privilege to work for him.
p304/p304_273|It was a very difficult period.
p304/p304_321|And then we got off the plane.
p304/p304_044|Scottish sport was not mentioned.
p304/p304_288|I lost my head.
p304/p304_379|Motorists will welcome this.
p304/p304_054|And then came the seventies.
p304/p304_320|He was rejected because he had retired.
p304/p304_190|I saw the whole thing.
p304/p304_297|What will they called?
p304/p304_275|It used to be less than five minutes.
p304/p304_166|What has changed?
p304/p304_376|They say they feel different.
p304/p304_195|They will have five minutes to decide.
p304/p304_250|ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
p304/p304_149|So what makes it so special?
p304/p304_074|Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
p304/p304_031|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p304/p304_292|You had to go and see him.
p304/p304_156|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p304/p304_124|But he admits he is deeply upset.
p304/p304_372|It is the voice of the survivors.
p304/p304_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p304/p304_226|I never agreed with that.
p304/p304_127|That could be at least five years away.
p304/p304_161|I have worked with him on projects.
p304/p304_311|It is a potential factor.
p304/p304_365|There was no disruption to services.
p304/p304_334|They were unable to revive him.
p304/p304_109|I can't believe it's all gone.
p304/p304_093|But we are losing that connection.
p304/p304_245|We want to learn lessons from that.
p304/p304_046|You have to have a sense of humour.
p304/p304_230|That could run into millions.
p304/p304_373|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
p304/p304_168|It is a symbolic concert.
p304/p304_027|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p304/p304_385|Clubs can only do so much.
p304/p304_350|There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
p304/p304_069|We have avoided that at least.
p304/p304_264|Had she enjoyed the experience?
p304/p304_101|This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
p304/p304_396|I doubt it would be genuine.
p304/p304_220|A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
p304/p304_080|It is bad news for us and England.
p304/p304_105|He did not know his daughter.
p304/p304_330|The matter will come up again.
p304/p304_090|They've got their own agenda.
p304/p304_352|There is room for me.
p304/p304_244|Now it has become a big picture.
p304/p304_056|I'm very angry about it.
p304/p304_325|I hope he has learned from it.
p304/p304_187|We could not get any possession.
p304/p304_375|Only the details have to be sorted out.
p304/p304_071|I do not believe they are.
p304/p304_103|He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
p304/p304_182|These are terrible offences.
p304/p304_147|They were due to have begun today.
p304/p304_269|I needed a little man in the crowd.
p304/p304_107|Our children are the future of our society.
p304/p304_029|I know my job.
p304/p304_212|Just don't go looking to be shocked.
p304/p304_112|We are about to have our own Parliament.
p304/p304_308|We are the gateway to justice.
p304/p304_266|The look on his face was something special.
p304/p304_185|There were so many characters among them.
p304/p304_138|How many cases have there been?
p304/p304_198|He was tough and relentless.
p304/p304_058|His track record is not promising.
p304/p304_233|I'm really excited about the album.
p304/p304_423|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p304/p304_280|That used to be another thing of mine.
p304/p304_211|I sincerely hope that will not change.
p304/p304_186|Or is it the European approach?
p304/p304_294|He met his wife and married in England.
p304/p304_129|Everyone can be bought.
p304/p304_393|Hard it will be.
p304/p304_414|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p304/p304_176|The result today is an impasse.
p304/p304_178|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p304/p304_130|You would be a fool not to listen.
p304/p304_271|Are we going to stay up?
p304/p304_403|Just get on with your job.
p304/p304_059|For a moment it was all about her.
p304/p304_397|You must be ready to play anyone.
p304/p304_188|Did you see that?
p304/p304_312|The working families tax credit is far better.
p304/p304_060|Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
p304/p304_338|It really was my favourite.
p304/p304_199|That would be unlawful.
p304/p304_038|At half-time you have?
p304/p304_348|Thirty people have applied for his job!
p304/p304_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p304/p304_154|This is our Olympics.
p304/p304_134|The Lobby is not failing.
p304/p304_317|Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
p304/p304_196|I see that any day now.
p304/p304_193|Then they were awarded a penalty.
p304/p304_329|The search has been called off.
p304/p304_366|We talk about effective military action.
p304/p304_363|She is still very poorly.
p304/p304_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p304/p304_028|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p304/p304_200|This guy is amazing.
p304/p304_072|That is completely against Islam.
p304/p304_203|They will want to perform well.
p304/p304_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p304/p304_150|It will be easier for us.
p304/p304_319|The teenager had been missing for six months.
p304/p304_381|She failed to win any of them.
p304/p304_247|I've enjoyed the whole experience.
p304/p304_035|But there was a heavy price to pay.
p304/p304_307|At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
p304/p304_122|We are taking the back seat on this.
p304/p304_172|Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
p304/p304_096|We will look into it.
p304/p304_078|Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
p304/p304_413|Which is worse?
p304/p304_228|I don't think it is vital.
p304/p304_268|We then went to see the headmaster.
p304/p304_394|He just attracted people.
p304/p304_091|This commitment should be built upon.
p304/p304_087|He was determined to write a novel.
p304/p304_026|Who cares about that?
p304/p304_314|It is too early to say.
p304/p304_398|It would have been a very explosive issue.
p304/p304_339|That is why this action has been taken.
p304/p304_324|We are all ecstatic.
p304/p304_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p304/p304_298|We come here in peace, for peace.
p304/p304_116|Among them are many criminals.
p304/p304_419|I can understand why they have gone.
p304/p304_136|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p304/p304_191|There is a demand for another hospice.
p304/p304_042|It was an ambush.
p304/p304_062|They don't know how to do it.
p304/p304_405|He said it was his greatest work.
p304/p304_037|We have a strong team at the moment.
p304/p304_036|The most important thing was to win today.
p304/p304_143|I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
p304/p304_048|We are waiting for advice on the film.
p304/p304_102|There, you were just a body.
p304/p304_252|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
p304/p304_034|SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
p304/p304_415|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p304/p304_249|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
p304/p304_119|It's totally double standards.
p304/p304_207|I love the moment of being first.
p304/p304_050|His father said, My son was lucky.
p304/p304_346|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p304/p304_287|I have got a wife to feed.
p304/p304_368|My neighbours are horrified.
p304/p304_371|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p304/p304_253|He wouldn't have played in all three.
p304/p304_205|Ownership was the game.
p304/p304_135|It was a takeover.
p304/p304_367|It was a discussion paper.
p304/p304_387|But it's a subtle process.
p304/p304_088|So is there anything left to say?
p304/p304_326|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
p304/p304_301|I can't stand this sort of stuff.
p304/p304_183|This is it finally finished.
p304/p304_248|He was totally without that form of fear.
p304/p304_081|They had failed to explode.
p304/p304_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p304/p304_242|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p304/p304_382|He is at war with his knee.
p304/p304_243|There is no pressure from anyone now.
p304/p304_335|This has come as a shock to everyone.
p304/p304_137|Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
p304/p304_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p304/p304_281|At the election we will oppose the euro.
p304/p304_110|I am just going to go for it.
p304/p304_291|You are not going in blind.
p304/p304_388|But let's not go down that road.
p304/p304_167|Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
p304/p304_238|But they will need to play to score.
p304/p304_131|No other offers apply.
p304/p304_082|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
p304/p304_342|It's all about money, money, money.
p304/p304_347|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p304/p304_389|It is not attempting to offer a solution.
p304/p304_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p304/p304_153|You need a trademark.
p304/p304_265|He has changed the country itself.
p304/p304_206|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p304/p304_261|The results are sometimes contentious.
p304/p304_285|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p304/p304_209|You cannot understand it until you experience it.
p304/p304_322|I think it is wide open.
p304/p304_181|Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
p304/p304_052|She was only doing her job.
p304/p304_132|Have you noticed?
p304/p304_255|It is a great shame.
p304/p304_418|We would all have liked to run.
p304/p304_258|I'll never think of myself as a star.
p304/p304_145|You have to think not.
p304/p304_259|I felt he was excellent.
p304/p304_310|We understand the changes in the world.
p304/p304_300|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p304/p304_344|What do we do for an encore?
p304/p304_117|This is not about revenge.
p304/p304_179|The real world is full of competing causes.
p304/p304_208|Some examples are presented in detail.
p304/p304_239|He is a joy to watch.
p304/p304_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p304/p304_380|It is not the message alone.
p304/p304_165|I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
p304/p304_404|We expect a full house on the night.
p304/p304_351|It is no place for a poet.
p304/p304_417|I would think they are just behind them.
p304/p304_085|Smoking is also very important.
p304/p304_194|Journalists should make him.
p304/p304_171|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p304/p304_374|I wish him well.
p304/p304_229|But he insisted that victory was possible.
p304/p304_386|Many other areas are coming up.
p304/p304_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p304/p304_141|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p304/p304_126|We are going to have a parade.
p304/p304_148|Do not listen to them.
p304/p304_222|We have a team to reach the final.
p304/p304_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p304/p304_411|But it was money well spent.
p304/p304_221|Who would be a referee?
p304/p304_412|They would never let him go.
p304/p304_146|This is a total mystery.
p304/p304_142|That's a pretty good percentage.
p304/p304_407|They are different types.
p304/p304_108|Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
p304/p304_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p304/p304_400|It is the worst of both worlds.
p304/p304_289|What are the barriers?
p304/p304_282|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
p304/p304_001|Please call Stella.
p304/p304_111|We will meet again.
p304/p304_162|It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
p304/p304_356|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
p304/p304_274|It's all going to clear the debt.
p304/p304_070|I love a clever reader.
p304/p304_095|I am about protecting the state pension.
p304/p304_421|People should not become complacent.
p304/p304_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p304/p304_237|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p304/p304_232|The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
p304/p304_118|How can we ignore it?
p304/p304_409|We are not too surprised.
p304/p304_395|It was better than a soap opera.
p304/p304_047|It is not about changing our image.
p304/p304_043|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p304/p304_065|If you can get away with it, you do it.
p304/p304_332|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
p304/p304_170|They would have looked out for each other.
p304/p304_364|That's how she wants to remember him.
p304/p304_383|I think we're going to make it.
p304/p304_410|They are not a set of options.
p304/p304_416|He took over our lives.
p304/p304_345|Things start to talk to each other.
p304/p304_284|He called for a public inquiry.
p304/p304_354|For next season, we have time to restructure.
p304/p304_378|Well, what can you do?
p304/p304_272|People were actually not on his side.
p304/p304_318|I don't understand it.
p304/p304_125|We told them in August.
p304/p304_286|I played badly, but it happens.
p304/p304_306|He is married, with two children.
p304/p304_114|We need to chat.
p304/p304_144|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p304/p304_254|And that includes the Barnett formula.
p304/p304_392|That's the way things are heading.
p304/p304_313|It added to the reverence.
p304/p304_099|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p304/p304_296|It makes no sense.
p304/p304_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p304/p304_139|But we have to plan for the future.
p304/p304_357|These will take a little time to develop.
p304/p304_051|But they also came with a downside.
p304/p304_068|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p304/p304_057|I have great respect for all my players.
p304/p304_276|It was by the numbers.
p304/p304_159|This is not a Scottish problem.
p304/p304_267|I can certainly see much better.
p304/p304_323|I am totally surprised.
p304/p304_263|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p304/p304_175|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p304/p304_304|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
p304/p304_053|Are you listening, All Saints?
p304/p304_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p304/p304_369|He had no problem with alcohol.
p304/p304_358|This is not a birthday party.
p304/p304_079|Could it be?
p304/p304_189|The cost of war is more than that.
p304/p304_030|The likelihood is that it will be negative.
p304/p304_360|It's a drop in the bucket.
p304/p304_216|The position on the euro remains unchanged.
p304/p304_067|You probably have never seen them before.
p304/p304_283|Teachers have been given the offer.
p304/p304_422|I will go out with him any time.
p304/p304_343|There wasn't anything in it.
p304/p304_315|It's to do with context.
p304/p304_420|That, though, was then.
p304/p304_077|We are almost at that point, but not quite.
p304/p304_128|That is my role.
p304/p304_359|Darren is very, very good.
p304/p304_362|I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
p304/p304_169|He asked me how they were doing.
p304/p304_174|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p304/p304_083|I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
p304/p304_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p304/p304_202|That is no use.
p304/p304_210|Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
p304/p304_377|We are in the hat.
p304/p304_214|I have learned from him.
p304/p304_213|It was total confusion.
p304/p304_218|That is why it is so lyrical.
p304/p304_113|Part of the complex is historic.
p304/p304_235|But there is a possible place.
p304/p304_151|I'm pleased for him.
p304/p304_160|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p304/p304_106|Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
p304/p304_316|David Trimble has sold out.
p304/p304_076|But, of course, it isn't.
p304/p304_025|So we will cut their numbers.
p304/p304_337|It is not for me, though.
p304/p304_121|It's something he works hard at achieving.
p304/p304_355|The truth, of course, is very different.
p304/p304_279|We are not asking for the moon.
p304/p304_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p304/p304_092|It was one he was born to play.
p304/p304_133|This is a wonderful honour for me.
p304/p304_361|I've had a hard time, to be honest.
p304/p304_391|I don't care to recall it.
p304/p304_152|The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
p304/p304_224|He was correct in everything he did.
p304/p304_399|It seems a waste of talents.
p304/p304_120|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p304/p304_341|There were many positives for this club.
p304/p304_204|We should not worry about other players.
p304/p304_045|I was doing a charity concert.
p304/p304_100|Did you get the script?
p304/p304_177|Nelson does not disappoint.
p304/p304_246|He can perform well under pressure.
p304/p304_340|They should be looking at his victims.
p304/p304_260|It was a policy they were against.
p304/p304_333|We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
p304/p304_084|Nor should there have been.
p304/p304_293|She says she has grown up.
p304/p304_192|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p304/p304_401|We need to tighten up.
p304/p304_086|I have a theory.
p304/p304_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p304/p304_180|They've got to decide to do that.
p304/p304_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p304/p304_064|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p304/p304_231|It might not survive the process.
p304/p304_049|I hadn't been looking after myself.
p304/p304_075|I will wait until later.
p304/p304_270|It would then be up to the judge.
p304/p304_234|We were desperate to get the game on.
p304/p304_066|First is open defiance.
p304/p304_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p304/p304_336|Yes, it was too short a night.
p304/p304_115|Justice was not seen today.
p304/p304_041|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p304/p304_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p304/p304_257|The council has been open and transparent.
p304/p304_327|You are a gambling man.
p304/p304_089|My back is feeling really good.
p304/p304_039|The butcher is very good.
p304/p304_215|Pupils will be the losers.
p304/p304_290|He is keen to stay in public service.
p304/p304_061|Trading Places was too obvious.
p304/p304_251|They have the cash to do that.
p304/p304_302|Is Saddam a threat?
p304/p304_402|His body was never found.
p304/p304_033|They agree to meet.
p304/p304_140|And yet his legacy is doubtful.
p304/p304_223|We want to be separate from our neighbours.
p304/p304_349|That is a lot of writing.
p304/p304_219|It isn't a happy memory.
p304/p304_227|He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
p304/p304_353|My life is in the ballet.
p304/p304_032|Scottish rugby has given me everything.
p304/p304_201|The same goes for McKenna.
p304/p304_217|Such actions are rarely popular.
p304/p304_303|The jury is still out.
p304/p304_256|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p304/p304_277|My Dad is a hero.
p304/p304_164|And there is no cause for it.
p304/p304_331|Our strategy is straightforward.
p304/p304_055|I guess it is down to focus.
p304/p304_098|We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
p304/p304_328|Who honestly expected anything else?
p304/p304_370|This was a very tragic accident.
p304/p304_241|We are now open.
p304/p304_197|But who knows?
p304/p304_240|They also have good neighbours.
p304/p304_158|There are plenty examples.
p304/p304_236|You can't have it both ways.
p304/p304_094|He was jailed for five years.
p304/p304_408|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
p304/p304_155|Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
p304/p304_157|My goal was very important to the team.
p304/p304_384|I didn't know where they were.
p304/p304_295|But it could have been written for her.
p304/p304_424|Public safety is paramount.
p304/p304_278|It is my fault.
p304/p304_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p336/p336_119|We just try to make great records.
p336/p336_106|Don't you believe it.
p336/p336_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p336/p336_337|Wouldn't it be nice?
p336/p336_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p336/p336_193|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p336/p336_092|Singing is my first love.
p336/p336_094|It's hard to see it.
p336/p336_180|I'm very happy to be here.
p336/p336_065|I let go the telephone and ran.
p336/p336_110|At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
p336/p336_296|I can't believe we didn't win that game.
p336/p336_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p336/p336_279|He denied the charge.
p336/p336_058|This ruling is a farce.
p336/p336_237|These were the dreams.
p336/p336_129|Everyone in front of me was dead.
p336/p336_208|So, where do we go from here?
p336/p336_278|It's not covered by the insurance.
p336/p336_334|They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
p336/p336_297|Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
p336/p336_127|It's better than that, it's fantastic.
p336/p336_001|Please call Stella.
p336/p336_372|His behaviour today has been disgusting.
p336/p336_088|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p336/p336_121|Why does it come out now?
p336/p336_028|This is a very interesting move.
p336/p336_355|It's been such a waste of money.
p336/p336_186|However, planners should be taking the lead.
p336/p336_333|He pretended not to care.
p336/p336_234|It may not be life long.
p336/p336_339|Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
p336/p336_419|Would he ever go back to the beginning?
p336/p336_135|Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
p336/p336_133|It has been declared.
p336/p336_328|And it's difficult to argue.
p336/p336_366|Who wouldn't do it?
p336/p336_159|Who do you think you are?
p336/p336_027|It is deeply worrying.
p336/p336_376|At this point we can only speculate.
p336/p336_089|But who was driving it?
p336/p336_336|Was it too obvious?
p336/p336_158|This is the culture change in medicine.
p336/p336_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p336/p336_238|But we must work in harmony.
p336/p336_417|They want to prove a point.
p336/p336_030|How could it not?
p336/p336_222|The warnings were a good reminder.
p336/p336_227|We have big ideas.
p336/p336_396|And then he laughs.
p336/p336_383|We are looking very hard at ourselves.
p336/p336_175|About time too, you might think.
p336/p336_057|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p336/p336_324|I don't want to do too much.
p336/p336_059|They enjoy playing the game.
p336/p336_085|I don't think it is.
p336/p336_132|I just have no maternal instincts.
p336/p336_201|It wouldn't go off.
p336/p336_416|It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
p336/p336_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p336/p336_203|The professor said the results were positive.
p336/p336_150|It's good for the city.
p336/p336_060|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p336/p336_260|All of them were killed.
p336/p336_322|No person has been charged.
p336/p336_323|One paper was not returned.
p336/p336_411|His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
p336/p336_371|It looked like a war zone.
p336/p336_306|This is a very special moment for me.
p336/p336_352|But it was fun.
p336/p336_223|I came here this week to work.
p336/p336_283|Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
p336/p336_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p336/p336_415|The auction has seven days to run.
p336/p336_332|There is a problem.
p336/p336_363|I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
p336/p336_069|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p336/p336_096|Sub Not Used, Mackay.
p336/p336_265|There is no point in denying that.
p336/p336_254|He has refused to do that.
p336/p336_285|The cause remained a mystery last night.
p336/p336_056|I have been there many times.
p336/p336_389|I am not going to sit back.
p336/p336_264|Ferguson must take the blame.
p336/p336_268|We're all going to take a holiday.
p336/p336_398|He put a lot of effort into it.
p336/p336_289|It has become very confused.
p336/p336_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p336/p336_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p336/p336_043|Yet therein is the problem.
p336/p336_198|But who will buy it?
p336/p336_240|There is no other way.
p336/p336_157|I want my audience to be challenged.
p336/p336_086|There are no other contenders.
p336/p336_382|I spoke to him yesterday.
p336/p336_211|And how much of a compliment is that?
p336/p336_329|We'll see what happens.
p336/p336_387|It's unusual to say the least.
p336/p336_075|But we will learn from that.
p336/p336_083|Would you have ever believed that was possible?
p336/p336_049|It was a joy.
p336/p336_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p336/p336_423|Tonight is very special.
p336/p336_400|I am not that sadistic.
p336/p336_273|I didn't expect to be in.
p336/p336_047|There can be no dispute about our history.
p336/p336_026|She took them for a term.
p336/p336_407|It would be that absurd.
p336/p336_359|I'd like to run.
p336/p336_284|I am not a liar.
p336/p336_114|We are getting there.
p336/p336_293|There was no secrecy.
p336/p336_390|But this is even worse.
p336/p336_357|Things don't look too good at the moment.
p336/p336_115|I just couldn't believe what had happened.
p336/p336_108|Most people know that.
p336/p336_032|Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
p336/p336_420|What is going on?
p336/p336_067|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p336/p336_312|They just would not have run away.
p336/p336_291|It's a national sport.
p336/p336_210|More than that, it's a vicious circle.
p336/p336_386|Taxes may need to rise.
p336/p336_275|I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
p336/p336_055|We said, What do you mean?
p336/p336_405|Is it any good?
p336/p336_107|There is another important factor.
p336/p336_066|Get used to it.
p336/p336_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p336/p336_205|It's part of the end game.
p336/p336_301|It was complete nonsense.
p336/p336_384|This is the stuff of live music.
p336/p336_160|Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
p336/p336_101|That is unlikely to happen.
p336/p336_235|Everyone was in tears.
p336/p336_368|He was taken to hospital, but later died.
p336/p336_070|Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
p336/p336_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
p336/p336_207|The train was on time.
p336/p336_232|It's not a party, no, no.
p336/p336_362|I am a player.
p336/p336_202|I've been enjoying it, though.
p336/p336_326|We have great support.
p336/p336_046|My office is down there.
p336/p336_197|Inspections are not the problem.
p336/p336_120|It's almost certainly not going to help.
p336/p336_050|It's the same with cinema.
p336/p336_103|This is not finished.
p336/p336_177|We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
p336/p336_303|It is three years.
p336/p336_113|It's there for people to look at.
p336/p336_062|It was a crucial moment.
p336/p336_190|The weekly average was three hours.
p336/p336_218|We have been through this with the lawyers.
p336/p336_068|Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
p336/p336_102|That is a mark of what you are.
p336/p336_393|The truth is he probably doesn't.
p336/p336_168|Their vision was not impeded.
p336/p336_099|That statement has never been withdrawn.
p336/p336_136|It's very hard to plan for it.
p336/p336_315|But he made a mistake in picking it.
p336/p336_340|It is a terrible thing to have happened.
p336/p336_178|The bombing has had a huge influence.
p336/p336_253|Our policy is very clear on this issue.
p336/p336_258|When will you listen?
p336/p336_353|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p336/p336_079|I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
p336/p336_131|I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
p336/p336_087|On that they agree.
p336/p336_404|But we say Yes - and we are the people.
p336/p336_317|They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
p336/p336_162|I hope he gets it.
p336/p336_215|What has changed?
p336/p336_262|Sub Not Used, McCormick.
p336/p336_025|I am very happy with the result.
p336/p336_090|We have to get this sorted out.
p336/p336_116|They never got into the show this time.
p336/p336_076|He has not created a Festival resource.
p336/p336_305|We meet again in Berlin.
p336/p336_104|It was one of the firemen.
p336/p336_406|The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
p336/p336_194|Where do you think she is going?
p336/p336_327|One would not want to go there anyway.
p336/p336_214|I have friends in Glasgow.
p336/p336_130|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p336/p336_256|All my training is for Athens.
p336/p336_217|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p336/p336_241|Everyone must be focused on the league.
p336/p336_153|It's like an extension of your body.
p336/p336_314|This idea has been around for four years.
p336/p336_188|New Labour are running scared.
p336/p336_343|The work was suspended following the kidnap.
p336/p336_038|IT is a terrible equation.
p336/p336_385|We were beaten by the better team today.
p336/p336_403|I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
p336/p336_230|I wish him well for the future.
p336/p336_093|When is it ever anything else?
p336/p336_271|I've had a wonderful career.
p336/p336_219|I'm not interested in the job.
p336/p336_134|His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
p336/p336_061|It is not standing army.
p336/p336_282|I watch the other visitors.
p336/p336_330|That could be in place by next year.
p336/p336_082|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p336/p336_267|Not that it is unique.
p336/p336_233|The lads are having a tour.
p336/p336_375|I'm interested in all kinds of history.
p336/p336_395|He is a one-off.
p336/p336_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p336/p336_031|It is sending the wrong message to people.
p336/p336_097|This is in a league of its own.
p336/p336_084|It will be easier for us.
p336/p336_154|Because he usually is.
p336/p336_248|She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
p336/p336_409|I just carry on with my work.
p336/p336_200|Openness is always the best way.
p336/p336_204|I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
p336/p336_247|He has to pull back from the brink.
p336/p336_074|Yet what is supposed to be said?
p336/p336_029|Are we not men?
p336/p336_176|However, it does not tell the full story.
p336/p336_034|We had a really good experience with David.
p336/p336_348|He is very much respected within the group.
p336/p336_397|She is having an affair with his partner.
p336/p336_109|I want to keep playing.
p336/p336_313|But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
p336/p336_321|Nobody should believe this story.
p336/p336_111|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p336/p336_292|I just made it.
p336/p336_225|Barry Ferguson is one of them.
p336/p336_412|He wants the festival to make a difference.
p336/p336_344|Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
p336/p336_054|I'm going to buy a car.
p336/p336_048|The crowd was waiting.
p336/p336_117|He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
p336/p336_280|I was shaking on the blocks.
p336/p336_236|It was just above the roof.
p336/p336_183|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p336/p336_399|The pressure is enormous.
p336/p336_319|This is a problem we have to tackle.
p336/p336_394|There were few surprises.
p336/p336_124|The whole thing was just unreal.
p336/p336_325|We don't have money to get to town.
p336/p336_401|Are you all right?
p336/p336_331|That's not part of the deal.
p336/p336_422|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p336/p336_287|I had no experience at all.
p336/p336_288|Yet he remains confident enough.
p336/p336_184|It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
p336/p336_257|This is a personal decision for me.
p336/p336_350|Bomber was not amused.
p336/p336_346|He wouldn't do it.
p336/p336_266|The kids are paying the price.
p336/p336_161|I have no battle with the Scots.
p336/p336_224|It's the last thing on my mind.
p336/p336_338|I was in tears in the street.
p336/p336_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p336/p336_226|The biggest resource is our staff.
p336/p336_073|Any error is severely punished.
p336/p336_040|It was pretty special.
p336/p336_126|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p336/p336_261|All the children on the roll are genuine.
p336/p336_318|Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
p336/p336_263|You can spend money on housing.
p336/p336_255|I can understand why they have gone.
p336/p336_244|I believe in theatre.
p336/p336_147|He looked at me before replying.
p336/p336_290|Fame and money followed.
p336/p336_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p336/p336_304|They are not always the same person.
p336/p336_277|If so, we want to hear from them.
p336/p336_051|It was the climax of the thing.
p336/p336_249|I don't have any regrets about the edit.
p336/p336_187|Cloning is not ready.
p336/p336_196|In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
p336/p336_081|The issues are not going to change.
p336/p336_302|I seem to keep this for the majors.
p336/p336_270|Some injustice was committed.
p336/p336_229|She told me to stop.
p336/p336_408|As if he would.
p336/p336_424|This is a matter of life and death.
p336/p336_251|The family baton is handed on.
p336/p336_080|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p336/p336_179|We've got a mixture of both.
p336/p336_311|That is when we are really effective.
p336/p336_373|Further expansion is possible.
p336/p336_295|Even then it might be difficult.
p336/p336_377|We know we have the quality.
p336/p336_221|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p336/p336_192|Don't hold your breath!
p336/p336_063|Someone else has now got them.
p336/p336_206|Do they play for the money?
p336/p336_039|That gives us something to kick against.
p336/p336_381|It is already making a difference.
p336/p336_246|It's time to say enough is enough.
p336/p336_274|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p336/p336_216|There's nothing to be gained by it.
p336/p336_388|I was quietly confident about getting the win.
p336/p336_320|Yes, it was uplifting.
p336/p336_037|That incident altered the pattern of the game.
p336/p336_209|The claim was denied by the first minister.
p336/p336_259|I'm happy that we have agreed.
p336/p336_242|The English are coming.
p336/p336_418|It is my decision and my decision alone.
p336/p336_356|Not so, it transpires.
p336/p336_351|I am not a happy man.
p336/p336_345|That is why we are here.
p336/p336_316|This is an appealing record.
p336/p336_378|In fact, he should never have been in the field.
p336/p336_252|She has a little boy.
p336/p336_095|I believe in trade unions.
p336/p336_141|We need to be more specific.
p336/p336_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p336/p336_281|There is no easy answer.
p336/p336_077|We couldn't afford it.
p336/p336_402|We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
p336/p336_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p336/p336_364|He was not alone.
p336/p336_308|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p336/p336_421|Let that be their memorial.
p336/p336_156|We have waited a long time for this.
p336/p336_174|The support from the general public was astounding.
p336/p336_035|It was another good idea.
p336/p336_171|However, they should not come as a surprise.
p336/p336_286|He had no problem with alcohol.
p336/p336_142|This is the man who provides the hope.
p336/p336_044|This isn't a new problem.
p336/p336_098|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p336/p336_100|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p336/p336_181|This is not the case.
p336/p336_185|They are now out in the cold.
p336/p336_105|Now, she has completed a family tradition.
p336/p336_149|This may be perfectly innocent.
p336/p336_118|But no, it's not funny.
p336/p336_369|Eriksson would have approved.
p336/p336_033|We are proud of them.
p336/p336_220|His contract was then not renewed.
p336/p336_307|It is a daunting task.
p336/p336_167|I can't do anything before nine.
p336/p336_071|The hearing was continued until a later date.
p336/p336_078|I get the bus.
p336/p336_169|He is married with three children.
p336/p336_410|She made no further comment.
p336/p336_392|I was living with my mum.
p336/p336_239|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p336/p336_276|I should think so, too.
p336/p336_310|That was me today.
p336/p336_122|In that case, the children were not missing.
p336/p336_036|I want to make a vigorous defence.
p336/p336_300|Beyond that would have been outrageous.
p336/p336_148|Then there is the Mini itself.
p336/p336_358|Inside, there is a kind of madness.
p336/p336_125|They haven't been thought through.
p336/p336_091|It was very fast.
p336/p336_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p336/p336_269|I've got three other ideas for the day.
p336/p336_041|Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
p336/p336_172|It could last five months.
p336/p336_391|It left me with a sadness.
p336/p336_228|How will we get there?
p336/p336_335|Not because they want to sing about something.
p336/p336_191|Is there a new way forward?
p336/p336_413|He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
p336/p336_053|It is nearly there.
p336/p336_138|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p336/p336_213|Politics is a tough game.
p336/p336_139|He is that good.
p336/p336_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p336/p336_166|Nobody could survive on that.
p336/p336_173|Everything is accounted for.
p336/p336_195|Safety is our first concern.
p336/p336_294|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p336/p336_245|Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
p336/p336_349|People want to learn.
p336/p336_182|This one was supposed to be so different.
p336/p336_380|It runs in cycles.
p336/p336_112|That is how we will be judged.
p336/p336_309|We have chosen for the patients.
p336/p336_199|And it's more subversive.
p336/p336_250|That does not mean we have failed.
p336/p336_152|Controllers major concern is safety.
p336/p336_052|He died from multiple injuries.
p336/p336_045|That, though, was just the start of it.
p336/p336_374|Tyson said he had made a mistake.
p336/p336_272|The BBC was a disgrace.
p336/p336_155|It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
p336/p336_143|This is a war over our home.
p336/p336_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p336/p336_370|We are all in the frontline.
p336/p336_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p336/p336_189|It is a good result for Great Britain.
p336/p336_137|There is nothing like this back home.
p336/p336_165|I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
p336/p336_379|It may be the first of many.
p336/p336_231|Cars are great for going long distances.
p336/p336_299|Relief was beyond belief.
p336/p336_042|I should say so.
p336/p336_163|Everything has its place and purpose.
p336/p336_354|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p336/p336_243|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p336/p336_064|The second is freedom.
p336/p336_164|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p336/p336_144|He's got me very well.
p336/p336_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p336/p336_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p336/p336_145|He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
p336/p336_170|These days will be back.
p336/p336_361|But this relative success has not been easy.
p336/p336_128|The criteria have changed.
p336/p336_072|Still, some additions are inspired.
p336/p336_151|The only answer is a public inquiry.
p336/p336_146|He was always nice to me.
p336/p336_140|We did not have a clue.
p336/p336_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p336/p336_365|There was too much at stake.
p336/p336_347|She becomes a mother.
p336/p336_360|Its future is no longer in question.
p336/p336_123|These figures are truly awful.
p229/p229_267|The warning is timely.
p229/p229_174|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p229/p229_198|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p229/p229_160|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p229/p229_211|It's the same old story.
p229/p229_320|It's not even finished.
p229/p229_260|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p229/p229_074|It is a job creation scheme.
p229/p229_187|The home was now under new management.
p229/p229_302|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p229/p229_099|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p229/p229_109|Before the game we went for a pint.
p229/p229_358|There is a cup final at stake.
p229/p229_058|What was the main difference?
p229/p229_033|And we have a singer.
p229/p229_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p229/p229_250|It's only fair.
p229/p229_355|It is long gone.
p229/p229_361|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p229/p229_064|We should have known.
p229/p229_243|It's an idea.
p229/p229_207|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p229/p229_328|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p229/p229_296|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p229/p229_068|I was as strong as a horse.
p229/p229_206|It wasn't to be.
p229/p229_213|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p229/p229_030|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p229/p229_271|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p229/p229_229|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p229/p229_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p229/p229_132|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p229/p229_371|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p229/p229_289|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p229/p229_069|Ferguson should take note.
p229/p229_279|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p229/p229_360|It was very formal.
p229/p229_209|I came home by ambulance.
p229/p229_287|I saw it at a ruck.
p229/p229_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p229/p229_096|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p229/p229_191|It is the whole package.
p229/p229_105|They were outside the circle.
p229/p229_128|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p229/p229_286|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p229/p229_073|It was chaotic.
p229/p229_165|He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
p229/p229_177|It's that sort of night.
p229/p229_292|We have other options.
p229/p229_301|I thought it was my only chance.
p229/p229_380|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p229/p229_166|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p229/p229_108|I didn't play well last year.
p229/p229_370|He could make it.
p229/p229_042|He did not know his daughter.
p229/p229_129|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p229/p229_090|However, it did not end that way.
p229/p229_127|It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
p229/p229_195|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p229/p229_306|This is a war over our home.
p229/p229_359|That is a break with tradition.
p229/p229_124|I joined a group.
p229/p229_169|Was this element always there?
p229/p229_131|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p229/p229_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p229/p229_305|There is no openness.
p229/p229_227|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p229/p229_230|Who was on the panel?
p229/p229_158|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p229/p229_097|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p229/p229_232|Saturday is gone.
p229/p229_121|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p229/p229_063|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p229/p229_076|I've not thought about it.
p229/p229_047|But it is all by design.
p229/p229_204|Last night was a key episode.
p229/p229_100|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p229/p229_080|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p229/p229_188|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p229/p229_268|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p229/p229_035|It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p229/p229_379|It's a long process.
p229/p229_135|It's an amazing landscape !
p229/p229_251|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p229/p229_094|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p229/p229_092|It is an old family habit.
p229/p229_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p229/p229_119|It's not fair.
p229/p229_376|It is a simple equation.
p229/p229_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p229/p229_113|I don't have many friends.
p229/p229_083|Someone who cares
p229/p229_041|It is not for any other purpose.
p229/p229_259|This is a big club.
p229/p229_318|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p229/p229_326|I am very happy to be here.
p229/p229_313|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p229/p229_199|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p229/p229_078|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p229/p229_215|The procedures were not in place.
p229/p229_353|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p229/p229_300|I was brought up in a mining background.
p229/p229_077|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p229/p229_298|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p229/p229_190|I drove the ball well.
p229/p229_264|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p229/p229_163|It was by the numbers.
p229/p229_348|Look at the witnesses.
p229/p229_310|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p229/p229_366|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p229/p229_167|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p229/p229_237|The track is currently covered in snow.
p229/p229_212|But we are not immune to the problem.
p229/p229_183|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p229/p229_303|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p229/p229_186|Is Saddam a threat?
p229/p229_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p229/p229_270|They are never here.
p229/p229_294|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p229/p229_139|If not, a deal could take many months.
p229/p229_297|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p229/p229_140|They took a risk.
p229/p229_239|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p229/p229_146|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p229/p229_053|A recording contract is on the horizon.
p229/p229_351|They may yet have the last laugh.
p229/p229_095|Until you hit the big games.
p229/p229_272|He was also married with two children.
p229/p229_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p229/p229_170|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p229/p229_036|I'd like to continue that record.
p229/p229_240|We are so proud.
p229/p229_347|I've got no secret.
p229/p229_284|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p229/p229_224|I had decided to quit the show.
p229/p229_253|It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
p229/p229_216|It was worth a photograph.
p229/p229_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p229/p229_246|We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
p229/p229_179|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p229/p229_386|Three years ago he would have been.
p229/p229_266|That is highly unfair.
p229/p229_261|I was happily surprised.
p229/p229_106|Two of the team became ill.
p229/p229_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p229/p229_384|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p229/p229_340|He did a good job.
p229/p229_155|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p229/p229_295|These figures are truly awful.
p229/p229_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p229/p229_136|So the European elections are extremely important.
p229/p229_172|I will tell you.
p229/p229_277|It's a way of life.
p229/p229_153|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p229/p229_088|They lived for their children.
p229/p229_061|Art is extra.
p229/p229_072|She died in hospital two hours later.
p229/p229_214|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p229/p229_281|People have no choice.
p229/p229_293|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p229/p229_314|It's certainly different.
p229/p229_218|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p229/p229_168|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p229/p229_173|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p229/p229_392|Yet the data is compelling.
p229/p229_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p229/p229_066|Try to save us.
p229/p229_057|She's a spy !
p229/p229_338|It has moved on in the last week.
p229/p229_316|This is the culture change in medicine.
p229/p229_039|They're just different.
p229/p229_134|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p229/p229_247|The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
p229/p229_138|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p229/p229_103|It is a good day for the coalition.
p229/p229_116|I was angry.
p229/p229_150|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p229/p229_220|That is an important part of our role.
p229/p229_157|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p229/p229_219|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p229/p229_262|They must play for each other.
p229/p229_162|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p229/p229_377|Talks are progressing.
p229/p229_228|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p229/p229_192|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p229/p229_123|I'm delighted about that.
p229/p229_242|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p229/p229_159|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p229/p229_154|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p229/p229_217|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p229/p229_045|It will come all right.
p229/p229_329|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p229/p229_067|That was the easy election.
p229/p229_248|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p229/p229_391|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p229/p229_044|I was scared.
p229/p229_357|Tell us about it.
p229/p229_181|Does that put pressure on us?
p229/p229_182|It is a memorial.
p229/p229_352|Everything was an effort.
p229/p229_330|It could have gone either way.
p229/p229_145|This represents a tough game for us.
p229/p229_368|I am a star.
p229/p229_278|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p229/p229_332|I'd like to take the plunge.
p229/p229_085|By then, he was walking on water.
p229/p229_193|We knew nothing about it.
p229/p229_258|Kirkwood was arrested.
p229/p229_038|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p229/p229_194|It is minute.
p229/p229_235|The boy is no longer with us.
p229/p229_363|It benefits the whole family.
p229/p229_046|But it took a lot of bottle.
p229/p229_112|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p229/p229_307|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p229/p229_362|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p229/p229_120|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p229/p229_331|He was then replaced by Ross.
p229/p229_288|I felt like I was a child.
p229/p229_344|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p229/p229_142|What will happen then?
p229/p229_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p229/p229_102|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p229/p229_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p229/p229_274|We're in shock.
p229/p229_388|It has been a lovely family occasion.
p229/p229_222|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p229/p229_079|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p229/p229_156|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p229/p229_087|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p229/p229_189|The hotel was now for sale.
p229/p229_346|Indeed, it was magical.
p229/p229_269|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p229/p229_369|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p229/p229_382|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p229/p229_093|Well, the big day has arrived.
p229/p229_263|The pensioners did not want to know.
p229/p229_349|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p229/p229_026|He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
p229/p229_345|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p229/p229_283|It was a privilege to work for him.
p229/p229_333|She did not attend the courtroom.
p229/p229_126|Who would be a referee?
p229/p229_282|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p229/p229_098|She's got to say something.
p229/p229_342|Today she has been released.
p229/p229_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p229/p229_364|It was fit for royalty.
p229/p229_180|The post will be unpaid.
p229/p229_086|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p229/p229_032|Because we do not need it.
p229/p229_254|It was a hit.
p229/p229_031|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p229/p229_390|There were no casualties.
p229/p229_365|We are looking for perfection.
p229/p229_196|Four policemen were wounded.
p229/p229_164|I knew he was good.
p229/p229_101|She has so much to offer.
p229/p229_115|I came to complete.
p229/p229_147|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p229/p229_141|Government will intervene.
p229/p229_104|We work on the same level.
p229/p229_226|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p229/p229_356|It's the last thing on my mind.
p229/p229_122|Maybe this battle has been.
p229/p229_043|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p229/p229_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p229/p229_050|We need to chat.
p229/p229_130|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p229/p229_374|It is not too late to get on board.
p229/p229_070|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p229/p229_324|We are very strongly behind the bid.
p229/p229_065|It is like a river running by my home.
p229/p229_325|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p229/p229_309|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p229/p229_319|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p229/p229_236|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p229/p229_257|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p229/p229_343|These days are long gone.
p229/p229_034|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p229/p229_234|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p229/p229_089|It is a lifeline.
p229/p229_111|It is normal.
p229/p229_197|What has caused the demise of singing?
p229/p229_185|One season, they might do well.
p229/p229_178|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p229/p229_056|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p229/p229_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p229/p229_255|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p229/p229_028|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p229/p229_233|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p229/p229_205|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p229/p229_176|We have to move forward.
p229/p229_040|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p229/p229_378|They play together perfectly.
p229/p229_210|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p229/p229_304|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p229/p229_336|The team for the first game could be this one.
p229/p229_290|The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
p229/p229_244|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p229/p229_184|They thought they had found a home.
p229/p229_354|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p229/p229_312|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p229/p229_114|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p229/p229_334|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p229/p229_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p229/p229_054|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p229/p229_060|And a film maker was born.
p229/p229_071|Neither it is.
p229/p229_245|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p229/p229_223|I am delighted for Simon.
p229/p229_029|I have a theory.
p229/p229_117|They were behind the wheel.
p229/p229_389|That's the name of the game, though.
p229/p229_075|It works for us.
p229/p229_231|We've got the bronze.
p229/p229_200|I've got good news and bad news for you.
p229/p229_225|The FBI could become involved.
p229/p229_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p229/p229_052|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p229/p229_175|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p229/p229_337|They haven't got a hope.
p229/p229_280|I am an estate agent.
p229/p229_221|She should not be blamed.
p229/p229_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p229/p229_265|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p229/p229_084|He can do everything.
p229/p229_241|We were a load of rubbish.
p229/p229_143|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p229/p229_249|The letters are going out today.
p229/p229_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p229/p229_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p229/p229_323|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p229/p229_373|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p229/p229_048|I am just going to go for it.
p229/p229_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p229/p229_118|The fire was above the hole.
p229/p229_059|My mother is a widow.
p229/p229_308|It's just not funny !
p229/p229_082|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p229/p229_311|You are the glory.
p229/p229_151|Who would be right?
p229/p229_285|If not, he should go home.
p229/p229_387|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p229/p229_062|Scotland had great assets.
p229/p229_001|Please call Stella.
p229/p229_339|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p229/p229_171|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p229/p229_125|It is rubbish.
p229/p229_137|He is slightly confused.
p229/p229_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p229/p229_335|He told the court.
p229/p229_133|She really suffered for her art.
p229/p229_110|I'm not depressed.
p229/p229_144|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p229/p229_350|I'm very lucky.
p229/p229_152|We just had a go.
p229/p229_367|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p229/p229_202|People will ask about us.
p229/p229_027|It's nice to hear.
p229/p229_238|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p229/p229_091|We must look forward.
p229/p229_148|Three penalties were given.
p229/p229_252|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p229/p229_256|This year I understood.
p229/p229_203|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p229/p229_275|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p229/p229_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p229/p229_322|It should be equal.
p229/p229_381|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p229/p229_055|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p229/p229_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p229/p229_149|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p229/p229_081|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p229/p229_201|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p229/p229_341|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p229/p229_315|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p229/p229_051|It is difficult for Ali.
p229/p229_161|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p297/p297_417|This is his personal life.
p297/p297_118|It's too big a risk to take.
p297/p297_349|It was all too little, too late.
p297/p297_079|Then he did it twice.
p297/p297_029|I feel strongly about it.
p297/p297_052|All will be revealed in due course.
p297/p297_411|You have to rely on each other.
p297/p297_395|It was to be published next month.
p297/p297_077|Raised the way you want it.
p297/p297_295|That idea is rubbish.
p297/p297_358|He said he had no reports of casualties.
p297/p297_121|The General Election is all to play for.
p297/p297_175|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p297/p297_327|You will never replace the child.
p297/p297_344|O, Is there anything in the wound?
p297/p297_245|I am sorry to hear this news.
p297/p297_286|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p297/p297_159|The captaincy will help that, too.
p297/p297_161|If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
p297/p297_167|They would never let him go.
p297/p297_186|Some may end up in hospital.
p297/p297_340|This is the start of a slippery slope.
p297/p297_388|We have big ideas.
p297/p297_061|Basically, the classical tradition won out.
p297/p297_410|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p297/p297_210|He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p297/p297_328|I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
p297/p297_348|Surely it can do better than that?
p297/p297_330|There will have to be a full inquiry.
p297/p297_372|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p297/p297_055|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p297/p297_225|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p297/p297_036|In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
p297/p297_396|It's not a party, no, no.
p297/p297_345|Mini rugby is a great thing.
p297/p297_043|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
p297/p297_153|That's my big challenge.
p297/p297_136|We were extremely poor.
p297/p297_375|This is the same old story.
p297/p297_138|It was better than a soap opera.
p297/p297_314|And he is immensely loyal.
p297/p297_394|I ran to get out of the way.
p297/p297_120|Our lives have been turned upside down.
p297/p297_269|The criteria have changed.
p297/p297_323|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p297/p297_222|There has been no reaction from them.
p297/p297_397|We have understood the problems for some time.
p297/p297_277|It does not move, which is amazing.
p297/p297_317|He confirmed that there had been no warning.
p297/p297_086|She is still very poorly.
p297/p297_092|The scientific debate is dead.
p297/p297_280|It may have been a cry for help.
p297/p297_058|You just have to accept.
p297/p297_206|From day one, we were a family.
p297/p297_099|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p297/p297_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p297/p297_155|They said we were out of touch.
p297/p297_142|Nato was not a love affair.
p297/p297_146|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p297/p297_164|It's always the same, isn't it?
p297/p297_322|I was pregnant and very worried.
p297/p297_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p297/p297_276|They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
p297/p297_105|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
p297/p297_231|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p297/p297_250|That is how it will be judged.
p297/p297_306|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p297/p297_045|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p297/p297_211|That's hard for a woman.
p297/p297_034|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p297/p297_363|So, where do we go from here?
p297/p297_068|We will be paying agency rates.
p297/p297_124|United were in control without always being dominant.
p297/p297_237|I have great confidence in Annabelle.
p297/p297_212|THE atmosphere was electric.
p297/p297_139|It's not a great art.
p297/p297_041|Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
p297/p297_359|It's easy to see why.
p297/p297_315|The actor has met with Mandela.
p297/p297_235|Some were close to tears.
p297/p297_364|I was never alone with her, right?
p297/p297_054|January is a bad time of year.
p297/p297_049|Things start to talk to each other.
p297/p297_203|The home team also had their moments.
p297/p297_027|And the art of performance is taking risks.
p297/p297_179|The first time you read a play.
p297/p297_267|When he came to see me on Monday.
p297/p297_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p297/p297_287|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p297/p297_143|We believe that the reason is poverty.
p297/p297_420|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p297/p297_293|But today was the real big one.
p297/p297_301|Almost overnight, he found his voice.
p297/p297_248|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p297/p297_371|What has changed?
p297/p297_125|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p297/p297_311|Bob Dylan's getting old.
p297/p297_160|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p297/p297_154|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p297/p297_347|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p297/p297_042|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p297/p297_300|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p297/p297_404|I played really well on the back nine.
p297/p297_209|It's a metaphor for consumption.
p297/p297_319|The company's in good shape.
p297/p297_381|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p297/p297_180|We are committed to urgent action.
p297/p297_236|I saw it at a ruck.
p297/p297_406|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p297/p297_373|It's like English in its underwear.
p297/p297_419|Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
p297/p297_350|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p297/p297_135|Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
p297/p297_147|We had a really good experience with David.
p297/p297_128|It was my shortest audition.
p297/p297_320|There are different cultures in different departments.
p297/p297_233|We need a visionary producer.
p297/p297_247|They chose the latter.
p297/p297_332|The way ahead is not easy.
p297/p297_081|You have to do your research.
p297/p297_337|You are going to take away my life.
p297/p297_076|I had a tie in my hand.
p297/p297_039|Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
p297/p297_038|You have caught a serial killer.
p297/p297_266|England against France is always a big game.
p297/p297_370|The vacancies are in support services and arts.
p297/p297_090|We talk about effective military action.
p297/p297_217|Access has been a nightmare.
p297/p297_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p297/p297_194|I'm sure you all can relate to that.
p297/p297_338|That was one very hard game.
p297/p297_254|Who did the recruiting?
p297/p297_102|It isn't just a defining issue for them.
p297/p297_387|Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
p297/p297_168|That could be in place by next year.
p297/p297_114|It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
p297/p297_333|He intends to appeal the sentences.
p297/p297_308|I can understand why they have gone.
p297/p297_183|I read it every year.
p297/p297_282|Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
p297/p297_390|And who would argue with that?
p297/p297_412|However, it was well worth the wait.
p297/p297_065|It's not only my respect for them.
p297/p297_384|I'm not sure.
p297/p297_380|You need a licence to run a pub.
p297/p297_094|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p297/p297_422|It's a true story.
p297/p297_223|She failed in her action.
p297/p297_093|I sincerely hope not.
p297/p297_080|We were short of athletes.
p297/p297_259|They were assured that it would.
p297/p297_418|Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
p297/p297_127|Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
p297/p297_334|There is no smoking gun.
p297/p297_192|We've never seen so many.
p297/p297_122|I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
p297/p297_352|It is only one night, after all.
p297/p297_087|That's how she wants to remember him.
p297/p297_242|Dialogue is the key.
p297/p297_084|It was the crowning point of my career.
p297/p297_157|Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
p297/p297_071|They can be time consuming.
p297/p297_421|It'`	s the tip of the iceberg.
p297/p297_318|I am not against a further inquiry.
p297/p297_361|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p297/p297_275|How do you find the youngsters?
p297/p297_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p297/p297_053|It was located on the remote control.
p297/p297_151|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p297/p297_044|Bombing is the easy option.
p297/p297_218|What does she consider her greatest achievement?
p297/p297_097|I was doing well at the hustings.
p297/p297_091|Craig is a major concern for us.
p297/p297_199|Any error is severely punished.
p297/p297_163|We meet again in Berlin.
p297/p297_133|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p297/p297_095|There is no such thing.
p297/p297_257|This is his first movie.
p297/p297_258|The farmers had no choice in the matter.
p297/p297_116|Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
p297/p297_207|Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
p297/p297_400|She now lives in London.
p297/p297_377|All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
p297/p297_392|This is the real thing now.
p297/p297_074|Subtle it is not.
p297/p297_057|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p297/p297_070|In the end, however, it all came together.
p297/p297_083|Its first awards will do just that.
p297/p297_299|It has not yet opened to pupils.
p297/p297_409|My heart is not so sure.
p297/p297_051|I would like to stay with Rangers.
p297/p297_108|She died in middle age.
p297/p297_181|I wish him well.
p297/p297_033|Other forces were, however, at work.
p297/p297_307|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p297/p297_200|They tend to be female and retired.
p297/p297_224|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p297/p297_141|It is easy to agree with him.
p297/p297_190|There's not much money in cycling.
p297/p297_110|A great deal has been achieved.
p297/p297_321|He was caught and fired.
p297/p297_229|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
p297/p297_131|Three penalties were given.
p297/p297_150|It is the wealthiest in Europe.
p297/p297_294|Someone else can do the cooking that night.
p297/p297_137|He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
p297/p297_386|We've been calling for a level playing field.
p297/p297_165|Don't get me wrong.
p297/p297_385|One might think that is a power.
p297/p297_403|In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
p297/p297_272|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
p297/p297_187|I'll tell you honestly.
p297/p297_274|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p297/p297_166|He died from multiple injuries.
p297/p297_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p297/p297_351|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p297/p297_268|Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
p297/p297_062|It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
p297/p297_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p297/p297_216|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p297/p297_196|I was just doing my job.
p297/p297_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p297/p297_230|They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
p297/p297_035|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p297/p297_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p297/p297_174|But what lies ahead?
p297/p297_082|Things were so intense in the studio.
p297/p297_241|Every game against New Zealand is.
p297/p297_382|I don't want a burial service.
p297/p297_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p297/p297_389|I hope the voters will respond.
p297/p297_106|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p297/p297_346|It was blown out of proportion.
p297/p297_205|He has not created a Festival resource.
p297/p297_285|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
p297/p297_189|News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
p297/p297_088|Do something that you haven't done before.
p297/p297_354|Gilbert was not amused.
p297/p297_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p297/p297_030|Tommy is not a problem.
p297/p297_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p297/p297_240|He just wants to leave a legacy.
p297/p297_109|You need insurance to bring people in.
p297/p297_152|I will go out with him any time.
p297/p297_204|I have played well the past two days.
p297/p297_026|We have gone on about him no end.
p297/p297_292|He looked at me before replying.
p297/p297_148|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p297/p297_132|But that's not the idea behind this article.
p297/p297_255|Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
p297/p297_335|His primary residence is Scotland.
p297/p297_415|It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
p297/p297_111|What was it like playing real people?
p297/p297_393|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p297/p297_296|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
p297/p297_107|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
p297/p297_025|But it's been kept to a minimum.
p297/p297_238|He's a sort of mystery figure.
p297/p297_232|She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
p297/p297_341|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
p297/p297_355|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p297/p297_226|The group will report back in the summer.
p297/p297_424|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p297/p297_158|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
p297/p297_169|I'm going to buy a car.
p297/p297_112|We are just being flooded.
p297/p297_246|However we're capable of beating them.
p297/p297_067|BIG Brother is listening to you.
p297/p297_072|It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
p297/p297_213|The boys are very confident.
p297/p297_149|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p297/p297_001|Please call Stella.
p297/p297_298|After that, we made some changes.
p297/p297_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p297/p297_037|My fitness was very poor.
p297/p297_195|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p297/p297_144|It's my nature.
p297/p297_198|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p297/p297_376|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p297/p297_398|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p297/p297_123|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p297/p297_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
p297/p297_297|He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
p297/p297_244|We just wish they had done so before.
p297/p297_263|But something has been lost in the translation.
p297/p297_367|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p297/p297_408|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p297/p297_353|The professor said the results were positive.
p297/p297_331|They are now out in the cold.
p297/p297_184|I think we've got the balance right.
p297/p297_040|I am writing a novel.
p297/p297_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p297/p297_182|Others may be trying to catch up.
p297/p297_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p297/p297_172|I'm not talking about his career.
p297/p297_069|This is a very high price.
p297/p297_085|You could feel the heat.
p297/p297_312|Our number one goal is prevention.
p297/p297_356|The course record was in his name.
p297/p297_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p297/p297_284|They were not up to the required standard.
p297/p297_170|Which is worse?
p297/p297_219|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p297/p297_119|It's an expensive part of their equipment.
p297/p297_374|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p297/p297_173|Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
p297/p297_290|Taxation should be simplified.
p297/p297_289|I couldn't put my finger on it.
p297/p297_313|Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
p297/p297_305|Who do you think you are?
p297/p297_066|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p297/p297_140|She took them for a term.
p297/p297_185|There is no guarantee.
p297/p297_096|However, their reaction could not have been more different.
p297/p297_103|However, what is his calibre?
p297/p297_365|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p297/p297_177|I couldn't honestly tell you.
p297/p297_366|I think we'll just keep it.
p297/p297_283|This is wrong, but that's believed.
p297/p297_339|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p297/p297_402|I don't have a problem with getting older.
p297/p297_383|And it's time for new leadership.
p297/p297_178|The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
p297/p297_130|It's unsafe for society.
p297/p297_234|I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
p297/p297_101|That gives it a spirit.
p297/p297_271|Who reminded him about the score?
p297/p297_378|They finished second and third.
p297/p297_221|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p297/p297_343|The girls are ready to compete.
p297/p297_046|Except for this, it was offside.
p297/p297_078|Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
p297/p297_407|One policeman was killed.
p297/p297_360|The board is currently resolving its differences.
p297/p297_316|But there was no time for that.
p297/p297_416|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p297/p297_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p297/p297_063|Nobody can get at them there.
p297/p297_391|I believe that gap is nearly there.
p297/p297_273|I will not walk away from this job.
p297/p297_126|Which brings us to the question of money.
p297/p297_028|Appointments should be made on merit.
p297/p297_405|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p297/p297_310|Your father was a good man.
p297/p297_048|What do we do for an encore?
p297/p297_368|It has proved a double whammy.
p297/p297_227|She looked so young.
p297/p297_228|I will let you in on a secret.
p297/p297_032|Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
p297/p297_325|It's only tackling congestion.
p297/p297_304|That, too, was over two years ago.
p297/p297_176|It was like the old days.
p297/p297_188|I let go the telephone and ran.
p297/p297_047|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p297/p297_329|Off with their heads.
p297/p297_265|I made a big mistake.
p297/p297_113|This ruling is unfair to everyone.
p297/p297_262|With us, we just want them to respond.
p297/p297_357|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p297/p297_423|There was a substantial explosion.
p297/p297_413|It is a thing of beauty to watch.
p297/p297_115|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p297/p297_202|We have a high quality product.
p297/p297_401|But every country has its own character.
p297/p297_156|My son was too young to die.
p297/p297_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p297/p297_193|After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
p297/p297_208|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p297/p297_201|I think it will make a huge difference.
p297/p297_288|We want to replicate that success.
p297/p297_324|I'll never have problems with any football managers.
p297/p297_145|He was shocked by what he saw.
p297/p297_362|He had lost his confidence again.
p297/p297_264|That's the last thing they need.
p297/p297_336|It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p297/p297_279|Part of England, is not?
p297/p297_414|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p297/p297_050|At the time, he was a living legend.
p297/p297_302|I want my audience to be challenged.
p297/p297_060|The tribunal continues today.
p297/p297_031|I started on fire a couple of times.
p297/p297_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p297/p297_129|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p297/p297_281|There were no passengers on board.
p297/p297_303|It was quite a new prescription.
p297/p297_260|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p297/p297_075|If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
p297/p297_261|She was charged with perjury.
p297/p297_309|They will give it a couple of years.
p297/p297_342|Don't hold your breath.
p297/p297_134|What did they think of her voice?
p297/p297_197|Blood samples were taken.
p297/p297_256|However, we had no failures in our side.
p297/p297_399|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p297/p297_104|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
p297/p297_326|I came into this world with nothing.
p297/p297_379|Everyone has his share of trouble.
p297/p297_369|We make good weapons.
p297/p297_098|My wife and family are the support system.
p297/p297_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p297/p297_239|Europe is not a threat to Britain.
p297/p297_059|People will see this over time.
p297/p297_278|We've always had a very positive attitude.
p297/p297_249|It's like a high school play.
p297/p297_220|The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
p297/p297_243|But they didn't much like that.
p297/p297_270|A new school will be built.
p297/p297_162|He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
p297/p297_056|That is an important part of our role.
p297/p297_100|The body follows the mind.
p297/p297_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p297/p297_291|That's a trend which will be encouraged.
p297/p297_251|It's there for people to look at.
p297/p297_191|Public safety is paramount.
p297/p297_215|This club have been fair to me.
p297/p297_117|The singer's condition was not specified.
p297/p297_171|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p333/p333_157|But he is not using them.
p333/p333_117|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p333/p333_394|If not, he should go home.
p333/p333_362|They have two children.
p333/p333_211|They must be kept on the ground.
p333/p333_304|It is a very special city.
p333/p333_195|There was no happy ending.
p333/p333_045|However, the report was incorrect.
p333/p333_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p333/p333_111|We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
p333/p333_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p333/p333_127|It was a disaster.
p333/p333_046|It does make a big difference.
p333/p333_099|Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
p333/p333_030|All would be under threat.
p333/p333_201|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p333/p333_408|There's nothing for you here.
p333/p333_194|There was an element of jealousy.
p333/p333_109|He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
p333/p333_376|You will not feel a thing.
p333/p333_414|A judicial review is also being considered.
p333/p333_192|I have been very nervous.
p333/p333_231|It's because they can't understand the language.
p333/p333_337|You encourage them - you can do it.
p333/p333_079|Then it was the turn of the carnival.
p333/p333_221|A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
p333/p333_310|That was him under pressure.
p333/p333_162|That's been our position all along.
p333/p333_090|It's a true story.
p333/p333_074|That would have killed the match.
p333/p333_256|We started from scratch.
p333/p333_071|Every game against New Zealand is.
p333/p333_176|He will be judged by his actions.
p333/p333_049|You can't give in to the vandals.
p333/p333_369|I felt we had fallen back a little.
p333/p333_124|He said it was the worst possible result.
p333/p333_322|This is my music.
p333/p333_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p333/p333_315|The Government has to grasp the nettle.
p333/p333_187|The feeling between the two men was mutual.
p333/p333_121|This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
p333/p333_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p333/p333_396|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p333/p333_265|It has to be funded.
p333/p333_001|Please call Stella.
p333/p333_159|I cannot believe she has been admonished.
p333/p333_326|It's fantastic to have finally won.
p333/p333_271|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p333/p333_116|Henry was strong and talented.
p333/p333_422|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p333/p333_288|It's too big a risk to take.
p333/p333_156|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p333/p333_125|Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
p333/p333_073|My game is in pretty good shape.
p333/p333_212|We still don't know.
p333/p333_303|I made a mistake.
p333/p333_095|Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
p333/p333_243|This is the subway.
p333/p333_324|I haven't won the world title.
p333/p333_219|If only we had known.
p333/p333_279|It is a very interesting subject.
p333/p333_389|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p333/p333_119|We must improve our relations with government.
p333/p333_182|It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
p333/p333_350|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p333/p333_142|However, it's good to turn the page.
p333/p333_407|However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
p333/p333_357|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
p333/p333_138|It is never an easy game.
p333/p333_312|He will make an excellent chief inspector.
p333/p333_316|Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
p333/p333_307|It's my favourite place to hang out.
p333/p333_348|So now you know.
p333/p333_169|They tried to give her advice.
p333/p333_229|Our job is to change that.
p333/p333_233|That is very, very bad news for our nation.
p333/p333_272|That's a very strong element.
p333/p333_131|I have been coming here for nine years.
p333/p333_409|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p333/p333_292|My wife is totally behind me on this.
p333/p333_180|In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
p333/p333_382|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p333/p333_048|Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
p333/p333_343|He was different from the rest of us.
p333/p333_395|There is no margin for error.
p333/p333_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p333/p333_130|Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
p333/p333_056|The performance was excellent.
p333/p333_150|The Scots are great.
p333/p333_054|My parents are exhausted.
p333/p333_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p333/p333_063|I didn't expect to get one.
p333/p333_301|I will carry on.
p333/p333_067|I've taken to the hills.
p333/p333_390|We have chosen for the patients.
p333/p333_418|I'd just like to play.
p333/p333_220|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p333/p333_043|Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
p333/p333_163|I was in jail for five years.
p333/p333_158|Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
p333/p333_318|However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
p333/p333_217|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p333/p333_248|It is a weakness, and not the only one.
p333/p333_406|After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
p333/p333_280|We know we can't rely on you.
p333/p333_155|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p333/p333_075|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p333/p333_161|It was a breathtaking moment.
p333/p333_174|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p333/p333_198|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p333/p333_400|Which means it matters.
p333/p333_413|Is this accurate?
p333/p333_336|It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
p333/p333_291|It is just too long since the war.
p333/p333_309|Was that not awful?
p333/p333_331|This Patton will also return.
p333/p333_200|Now it has been eclipsed.
p333/p333_262|THE headless man has finally developed a face.
p333/p333_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p333/p333_242|It ignores the future.
p333/p333_086|That is in the public domain.
p333/p333_261|The New Deal will constantly be improved.
p333/p333_381|There are moments of honesty, too.
p333/p333_246|We were hopeful that it would be successful.
p333/p333_421|Three months or so later, they are returning.
p333/p333_205|It has come as a bombshell.
p333/p333_051|And does it even matter?
p333/p333_070|The crowd was awesome.
p333/p333_351|I foolishly had done nothing about it.
p333/p333_391|They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
p333/p333_092|John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
p333/p333_148|That alibi is now gone.
p333/p333_420|It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
p333/p333_151|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p333/p333_297|And sooner than we may think.
p333/p333_050|Everything was an effort.
p333/p333_044|Nobody else was with me.
p333/p333_172|It's going to be epic.
p333/p333_066|It sounded awfully like panic.
p333/p333_085|It was different from our other work.
p333/p333_275|It was a journey into a new life.
p333/p333_228|But Annika is just amazing.
p333/p333_041|We have nothing to say about that.
p333/p333_126|This is our way to make our point.
p333/p333_145|That is impressive by any standards.
p333/p333_284|There is something in this.
p333/p333_399|In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
p333/p333_173|Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
p333/p333_393|He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
p333/p333_355|We have obviously got some work to do.
p333/p333_103|Maybe he will act again.
p333/p333_218|Or some thought that they have.
p333/p333_404|She said he showed no remorse.
p333/p333_097|They didn't take you to mass graves.
p333/p333_240|We are all equal.
p333/p333_160|We are not moving in.
p333/p333_055|No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
p333/p333_269|It was very frightened and dirty.
p333/p333_042|We've tried every other way.
p333/p333_344|His name is Michael Owen.
p333/p333_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p333/p333_104|Safety was also an issue.
p333/p333_306|They certainly do not socialise.
p333/p333_328|And now he tells us.
p333/p333_062|The chief constable is right.
p333/p333_209|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p333/p333_185|This area is perfect for children.
p333/p333_186|No, they have not.
p333/p333_058|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p333/p333_386|But there's no eye contact.
p333/p333_196|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p333/p333_064|It has been blown out of all proportion.
p333/p333_110|It needs somebody to give way.
p333/p333_222|You'll get on like a house on fire.
p333/p333_266|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p333/p333_308|I think that could work to our advantage.
p333/p333_183|The same goes for personnel.
p333/p333_053|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p333/p333_129|He was back to square one.
p333/p333_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p333/p333_385|It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
p333/p333_334|He came in an army uniform.
p333/p333_197|I didn't play well last year.
p333/p333_300|I know you went back this morning.
p333/p333_031|Some will be deployed on submarines.
p333/p333_040|It is time for a new approach.
p333/p333_380|All of the names are familiar to me.
p333/p333_416|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p333/p333_249|He's in with the furniture.
p333/p333_402|There is a great potential on this river.
p333/p333_397|I get very excited by that.
p333/p333_263|I heard some of his remarks.
p333/p333_251|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p333/p333_239|I want to play at the highest level.
p333/p333_293|Debbie Harry was cool.
p333/p333_294|Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
p333/p333_230|She will also get a pay rise.
p333/p333_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p333/p333_120|Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
p333/p333_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p333/p333_367|There was a great support all round the route.
p333/p333_210|Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
p333/p333_274|The whole region is in shock.
p333/p333_276|It's a way of making a mark.
p333/p333_340|The stadium was full.
p333/p333_384|We used to keep our business rates.
p333/p333_332|That is as it may be.
p333/p333_330|Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
p333/p333_025|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p333/p333_356|Which he can do.
p333/p333_423|I don't know why you say goodbye.
p333/p333_254|What's it got to do with them, anyway?
p333/p333_175|He just carried on filming.
p333/p333_089|In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
p333/p333_296|That sort of thing is long gone.
p333/p333_341|Cinema is a communal experience.
p333/p333_146|There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
p333/p333_144|It was important to win the singles.
p333/p333_191|When he took over it really took off.
p333/p333_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p333/p333_193|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p333/p333_252|Who will provide the wine?
p333/p333_080|But the tragedy did not stop there.
p333/p333_387|There was no energy behind it.
p333/p333_257|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p333/p333_068|John was a very nice man.
p333/p333_184|In a way he was.
p333/p333_392|It is not a wish list.
p333/p333_319|I was doing well at the hustings.
p333/p333_052|This is the same old story.
p333/p333_298|Raised the way you want it.
p333/p333_226|I hope they understand that.
p333/p333_415|I want to win this thing.
p333/p333_118|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p333/p333_236|It is a big time for me.
p333/p333_135|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p333/p333_165|His funeral is not expected until next week.
p333/p333_278|You were the kidnappers.
p333/p333_189|I was chosen to do this.
p333/p333_267|I was just overwhelmed.
p333/p333_123|Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
p333/p333_287|There are no plans to change this.
p333/p333_403|This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
p333/p333_154|She is a valuable member of the Government.
p333/p333_321|We are worried about casualties.
p333/p333_057|Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
p333/p333_290|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p333/p333_039|His views are hardly surprising.
p333/p333_352|The feeling is awesome.
p333/p333_360|And we're talking Big Money.
p333/p333_152|However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
p333/p333_282|It was indeed a night to remember.
p333/p333_037|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p333/p333_339|I always said No.
p333/p333_333|They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
p333/p333_168|They got the job done.
p333/p333_313|I'm not blaming audiences.
p333/p333_345|He's got a great chance of making it.
p333/p333_179|It is a job creation scheme.
p333/p333_359|They were that poor.
p333/p333_419|They were in good humour, too.
p333/p333_114|The days of empty promises are over.
p333/p333_302|A review of the decision is being sought.
p333/p333_115|I thought he was terrific.
p333/p333_076|I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
p333/p333_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p333/p333_206|Before the games it was pretty open.
p333/p333_034|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p333/p333_108|Clark is back on top form.
p333/p333_224|It could not be too high.
p333/p333_093|It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
p333/p333_370|Both managements are very supportive.
p333/p333_077|They had not been handcuffed.
p333/p333_238|It's something we want to make work.
p333/p333_140|No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
p333/p333_289|It's going to be quite a challenge.
p333/p333_203|Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
p333/p333_245|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p333/p333_028|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p333/p333_083|All of us do.
p333/p333_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p333/p333_388|They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
p333/p333_327|But she's also beautiful behind the face.
p333/p333_078|I think we will join the single currency.
p333/p333_100|Could they perhaps be related?
p333/p333_164|There are no charges.
p333/p333_107|There was nobody on the roof.
p333/p333_096|He could face a jail sentence.
p333/p333_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p333/p333_255|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p333/p333_349|But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
p333/p333_311|Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
p333/p333_026|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p333/p333_143|He had reason to be pleased.
p333/p333_234|Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
p333/p333_250|There are two games to go after that.
p333/p333_061|Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
p333/p333_112|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p333/p333_375|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p333/p333_132|It is just part of modern day life.
p333/p333_178|I didn't mean to kill her.
p333/p333_412|I have not come in to take over.
p333/p333_133|A young Briton had a lucky escape.
p333/p333_268|It had been in place since last July.
p333/p333_361|His silence on the issue is interesting.
p333/p333_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p333/p333_094|Subs not used, McCulloch.
p333/p333_139|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p333/p333_167|I am very, very happy.
p333/p333_346|Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
p333/p333_338|The winner will be announced by early summer.
p333/p333_286|That's why he plays for Scotland.
p333/p333_258|There are a few changes.
p333/p333_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p333/p333_170|They won the trophy in the Hoops.
p333/p333_365|I'm really proud of my young players.
p333/p333_363|With Pierre, you can never be sure.
p333/p333_368|They should feel ashamed.
p333/p333_215|This is a foolish idea.
p333/p333_136|YOU thought it was a headache.
p333/p333_047|Do not forget about Monaco.
p333/p333_166|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p333/p333_353|By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
p333/p333_277|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p333/p333_283|It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
p333/p333_072|The jury is still out on this one.
p333/p333_081|They wanted to show what they could do.
p333/p333_244|Altman has every right to be bitter.
p333/p333_247|Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
p333/p333_354|Smith has not let him down.
p333/p333_347|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p333/p333_320|We will just get on with it.
p333/p333_208|He is only now regaining his confidence.
p333/p333_102|We all thought we were going to die.
p333/p333_295|We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
p333/p333_342|So, how will it be received in the US?
p333/p333_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p333/p333_378|It's not just for classical music.
p333/p333_084|But will they fall in love?
p333/p333_113|I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
p333/p333_329|I am not changing my event.
p333/p333_259|You're not going to get hurt.
p333/p333_035|Bobby Robson called him a genius.
p333/p333_087|The Hague is too good for him.
p333/p333_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p333/p333_281|Arguably, they have already done it.
p333/p333_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p333/p333_149|We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
p333/p333_188|That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
p333/p333_153|I will certainly be having words with him.
p333/p333_260|THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
p333/p333_204|It is legally binding.
p333/p333_253|We are still getting signals.
p333/p333_410|Officials say the city must achieve this.
p333/p333_101|Happily we found it in the library.
p333/p333_411|It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
p333/p333_227|Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
p333/p333_059|It will come up here.
p333/p333_401|I think it can count against you now.
p333/p333_106|I know a lot of people who don't.
p333/p333_134|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p333/p333_177|I never found my rhythm.
p333/p333_032|There are moments of silence.
p333/p333_038|Too many factors are now working against him.
p333/p333_424|Appointed general secretary last September.
p333/p333_105|That's why he visited.
p333/p333_202|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p333/p333_036|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p333/p333_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p333/p333_225|How many cases have there been?
p333/p333_358|It has been recorded twice.
p333/p333_213|Police have appealed for witnesses.
p333/p333_325|After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
p333/p333_065|This is only the start of my season.
p333/p333_091|We are looking for volunteers.
p333/p333_082|It runs until the beginning of June.
p333/p333_417|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p333/p333_383|Is that where we are?
p333/p333_141|The post will run for four years.
p333/p333_207|We didn't know he was even out.
p333/p333_223|Two and a half million people have died.
p333/p333_137|All the people thought that he would die.
p333/p333_181|We might be back next year.
p333/p333_232|It is time for a more honest approach.
p333/p333_317|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p333/p333_364|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p333/p333_264|Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
p333/p333_377|It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
p333/p333_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p333/p333_216|It separates the men from the boys.
p333/p333_237|There were two things going on at once.
p333/p333_235|What's it all about?
p333/p333_366|People buy everything with cash.
p333/p333_128|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p333/p333_088|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p333/p333_199|That certainly brought me back down to earth.
p333/p333_069|This is a big, big win.
p333/p333_033|So now this series has had its day.
p333/p333_060|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p333/p333_273|How much of a cop out is that?
p333/p333_190|The weekly average was three hours.
p333/p333_323|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p333/p333_372|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p333/p333_241|That is the key message.
p333/p333_371|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p333/p333_270|Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
p333/p333_405|They hold on for many years.
p333/p333_335|Eleven events are required.
p333/p333_122|A venue was found.
p333/p333_373|This is important for two reasons.
p333/p333_299|However, consumers may take a different view.
p333/p333_171|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p333/p333_027|But who shot the president?
p333/p333_098|There was no option.
p333/p333_305|A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
p333/p333_285|I could feel the blood on my face.
p333/p333_147|I'm thinking, what would be easier?
p333/p333_379|This must be kept in total perspective.
p333/p333_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p333/p333_398|Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
p333/p333_374|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p285/p285_325|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p285/p285_328|The outcome is not in doubt.
p285/p285_389|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p285/p285_051|I love the Dome.
p285/p285_218|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p285/p285_198|The service from the other players was super.
p285/p285_392|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p285/p285_159|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p285/p285_126|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p285/p285_214|People should make their own decisions.
p285/p285_402|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p285/p285_070|Even the one she loved.
p285/p285_252|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p285/p285_050|It's a miracle.
p285/p285_153|My Dad is a hero.
p285/p285_201|Today was first class.
p285/p285_271|It was very fast.
p285/p285_047|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p285/p285_226|At the time, he was a living legend.
p285/p285_103|She reflects a bit.
p285/p285_195|I came home by ambulance.
p285/p285_116|Who would be a referee?
p285/p285_313|Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
p285/p285_270|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p285/p285_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p285/p285_376|Something is wrong.
p285/p285_075|He is in the queue.
p285/p285_096|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p285/p285_378|You can cope with it.
p285/p285_060|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p285/p285_099|No, the equipment is extra.
p285/p285_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p285/p285_142|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p285/p285_356|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p285/p285_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p285/p285_206|Twaddle is a case in point.
p285/p285_105|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p285/p285_083|It will be tight.
p285/p285_107|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p285/p285_310|We are a peaceful people.
p285/p285_245|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p285/p285_049|I was lost.
p285/p285_398|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p285/p285_074|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p285/p285_385|They deserved the win.
p285/p285_359|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p285/p285_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p285/p285_219|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p285/p285_085|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p285/p285_311|Hartley should know.
p285/p285_067|I had my suspicions.
p285/p285_393|But we are a young side.
p285/p285_172|One season, they might do well.
p285/p285_135|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p285/p285_119|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p285/p285_086|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p285/p285_230|They tried to give her advice.
p285/p285_391|They are good.
p285/p285_092|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p285/p285_312|Henman has been warned.
p285/p285_267|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p285/p285_256|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p285/p285_199|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p285/p285_278|He looked very sharp.
p285/p285_150|We are on a four-year mission.
p285/p285_132|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p285/p285_383|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p285/p285_185|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p285/p285_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p285/p285_360|This is a club on the rise.
p285/p285_361|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p285/p285_292|He was at home with his pals.
p285/p285_314|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p285/p285_123|It is not a U-turn.
p285/p285_374|I'm still an amateur in that sense.
p285/p285_171|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p285/p285_366|It seems a long time ago.
p285/p285_320|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p285/p285_231|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p285/p285_101|Oil embargo endorsed.
p285/p285_305|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p285/p285_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p285/p285_036|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p285/p285_308|The letters are going out today.
p285/p285_382|Yet the data is compelling.
p285/p285_131|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p285/p285_093|It was mayhem.
p285/p285_327|The party is up for it.
p285/p285_316|It will work.
p285/p285_274|I feel pretty good.
p285/p285_342|They should take their mobile phones.
p285/p285_046|He looks like an Afghan.
p285/p285_377|It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
p285/p285_117|We enjoyed it today.
p285/p285_208|It's not ideal.
p285/p285_128|We work well together.
p285/p285_236|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p285/p285_001|Please call Stella.
p285/p285_349|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p285/p285_243|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p285/p285_100|We have an election in eight days.
p285/p285_071|It's now down in black and white.
p285/p285_229|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p285/p285_064|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p285/p285_224|He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
p285/p285_381|It is the old story.
p285/p285_276|She looked so young.
p285/p285_162|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p285/p285_069|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p285/p285_054|That's the truth.
p285/p285_121|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p285/p285_102|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p285/p285_235|It's quite nice.
p285/p285_297|One was a lawyer.
p285/p285_178|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p285/p285_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p285/p285_097|They tried to deny it.
p285/p285_397|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p285/p285_151|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p285/p285_238|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p285/p285_048|Here's a clue.
p285/p285_169|I carried on for him.
p285/p285_209|We want to keep the pound.
p285/p285_242|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p285/p285_215|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p285/p285_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p285/p285_367|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p285/p285_379|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p285/p285_073|What has changed?
p285/p285_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p285/p285_257|Is that a serious question?
p285/p285_334|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p285/p285_387|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p285/p285_210|In each case they were a goal down.
p285/p285_384|It's just outrageous.
p285/p285_291|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p285/p285_365|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p285/p285_032|This is the window.
p285/p285_025|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p285/p285_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p285/p285_057|Scotland had great assets.
p285/p285_216|Because they didn't want to know.
p285/p285_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p285/p285_091|I saw the whole thing.
p285/p285_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p285/p285_164|They are not advertised.
p285/p285_031|There's a story, too.
p285/p285_369|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p285/p285_306|There is no excuse.
p285/p285_137|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p285/p285_063|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p285/p285_364|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p285/p285_114|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p285/p285_191|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p285/p285_290|There was a vacuum.
p285/p285_084|This is the start of our season.
p285/p285_399|Is that possible?
p285/p285_205|He knows a lot.
p285/p285_250|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p285/p285_044|Is a drug dealer?
p285/p285_353|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p285/p285_197|We live by the rule of law.
p285/p285_155|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p285/p285_282|Yet, it worked.
p285/p285_111|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p285/p285_183|Many innocent people will die.
p285/p285_127|I am now unemployed.
p285/p285_289|Who can predict?
p285/p285_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p285/p285_157|Well, he should know.
p285/p285_286|We are not going to forget.
p285/p285_239|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p285/p285_204|There was an e-mail.
p285/p285_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p285/p285_115|It is rubbish.
p285/p285_249|There's the mix.
p285/p285_154|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p285/p285_042|Sure, it's funny.
p285/p285_213|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p285/p285_146|The weather forecast isn't good.
p285/p285_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p285/p285_329|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p285/p285_283|Who will perform?
p285/p285_077|All options are open.
p285/p285_066|The death rates are still as high.
p285/p285_112|It is so sad.
p285/p285_403|Emotions were complex.
p285/p285_212|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p285/p285_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p285/p285_080|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p285/p285_300|It could work.
p285/p285_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p285/p285_177|I drove the ball well.
p285/p285_319|Off with their heads.
p285/p285_370|There is no signature.
p285/p285_045|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p285/p285_347|There may be reasons for it.
p285/p285_225|But she was.
p285/p285_194|It's a fact.
p285/p285_264|He was also married with two children.
p285/p285_323|Either team will be hard.
p285/p285_200|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p285/p285_149|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p285/p285_186|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p285/p285_255|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p285/p285_340|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p285/p285_207|It's not before time.
p285/p285_175|It is not either national standards or local control.
p285/p285_346|I HAVE a dream.
p285/p285_139|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p285/p285_324|It's not long enough.
p285/p285_299|They are wrong.
p285/p285_138|Who would be right?
p285/p285_122|She really suffered for her art.
p285/p285_140|I was awful.
p285/p285_395|It will take place in July.
p285/p285_181|Nothing is safe.
p285/p285_176|My players are special.
p285/p285_341|I will miss him.
p285/p285_386|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p285/p285_090|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p285/p285_193|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p285/p285_078|I was too young.
p285/p285_284|It was good.
p285/p285_037|They're just different.
p285/p285_087|We knew they could do it.
p285/p285_125|No production was achieved.
p285/p285_338|I'm very lucky.
p285/p285_180|His name was unknown.
p285/p285_333|Three years ago he would have been.
p285/p285_263|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p285/p285_355|We will be homeless.
p285/p285_095|It is a love affair.
p285/p285_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p285/p285_371|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p285/p285_173|As we worked.
p285/p285_160|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p285/p285_315|A review is under way.
p285/p285_336|I've got no secret.
p285/p285_170|He was a crazy man.
p285/p285_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p285/p285_317|I came into this world with nothing.
p285/p285_035|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p285/p285_233|Wealth is relative.
p285/p285_166|Seven people were later detained by police.
p285/p285_141|That group reported just before Christmas.
p285/p285_273|They seem to get away with it.
p285/p285_241|If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
p285/p285_351|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p285/p285_053|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p285/p285_109|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p285/p285_326|He scored a touchdown.
p285/p285_129|It's not true.
p285/p285_388|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p285/p285_302|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p285/p285_145|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p285/p285_228|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p285/p285_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p285/p285_187|What has caused the demise of singing?
p285/p285_362|They believed it worked.
p285/p285_130|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p285/p285_120|There were no grounds for his action.
p285/p285_260|There's not much money in cycling.
p285/p285_269|Of course I was tempted.
p285/p285_330|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p285/p285_108|Is that right?
p285/p285_056|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p285/p285_285|Who did the recruiting?
p285/p285_223|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p285/p285_350|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p285/p285_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p285/p285_401|What was the difference between them?
p285/p285_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p285/p285_106|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p285/p285_133|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p285/p285_113|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p285/p285_147|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p285/p285_089|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p285/p285_303|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p285/p285_354|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p285/p285_258|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p285/p285_118|She does not want to speak.
p285/p285_167|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p285/p285_352|The pair are very much in love.
p285/p285_136|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p285/p285_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p285/p285_094|Journalists should make him.
p285/p285_363|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p285/p285_275|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p285/p285_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p285/p285_390|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p285/p285_076|He is driven.
p285/p285_058|It's that kind of place.
p285/p285_148|I was on a roll.
p285/p285_043|This represents a tough game for us.
p285/p285_348|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p285/p285_184|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p285/p285_344|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p285/p285_318|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p285/p285_062|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p285/p285_059|They are real.
p285/p285_246|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p285/p285_332|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p285/p285_033|He was jailed for five years.
p285/p285_081|It is a blow.
p285/p285_298|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p285/p285_295|She is really magic.
p285/p285_268|We're in shock.
p285/p285_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p285/p285_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p285/p285_279|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p285/p285_307|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p285/p285_217|That has been the easy part.
p285/p285_196|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p285/p285_234|You should be.
p285/p285_134|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p285/p285_221|I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
p285/p285_304|It needs a team approach.
p285/p285_277|It's so awful.
p285/p285_052|There was no safety net.
p285/p285_220|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p285/p285_055|We will treat it like a World Cup match.
p285/p285_061|We should have known.
p285/p285_174|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p285/p285_026|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p285/p285_265|The system can work.
p285/p285_161|As, indeed, they would be.
p285/p285_088|But I was wrong.
p285/p285_253|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p285/p285_254|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p285/p285_358|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p285/p285_165|Tell it like it was?
p285/p285_281|He will address the nation this evening.
p285/p285_296|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p285/p285_373|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p285/p285_262|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p285/p285_339|Our policy is clear.
p285/p285_301|This is a war over our home.
p285/p285_345|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p285/p285_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p285/p285_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p285/p285_158|I will tell you.
p285/p285_143|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p285/p285_104|It was an interesting thing to do.
p285/p285_182|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p285/p285_244|I WAS certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p285/p285_038|It was clear.
p285/p285_144|The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
p285/p285_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p285/p285_202|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p285/p285_380|At the last I found a bunker.
p285/p285_372|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p285/p285_110|It was the eighties.
p285/p285_368|So there, we won.
p285/p285_266|We are happy.
p285/p285_251|The concerns are the same.
p285/p285_098|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p285/p285_168|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p285/p285_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p285/p285_375|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p285/p285_222|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p285/p285_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p285/p285_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p285/p285_321|There was no time scale.
p285/p285_294|I was brought up in a mining background.
p285/p285_322|Our message was inclusive.
p285/p285_394|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p285/p285_287|No Briton has ever won.
p285/p285_065|There could be a way back.
p285/p285_280|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p285/p285_203|I don't want to use it.
p285/p285_068|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p285/p285_261|Souter will be back.
p285/p285_072|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p285/p285_240|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p285/p285_227|My wife and family are the support system.
p285/p285_247|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p285/p285_190|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p285/p285_309|She is very distinctive.
p285/p285_288|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p285/p285_232|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p285/p285_293|What has altered?
p285/p285_188|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p285/p285_156|That includes the equipment?
p285/p285_331|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p285/p285_179|The goals were good.
p285/p285_211|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p285/p285_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p285/p285_163|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p285/p285_248|It was a hit.
p285/p285_082|They lived for their children.
p285/p285_335|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p285/p285_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p285/p285_079|Someone who cares
p285/p285_039|Indeed, he does.
p285/p285_124|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p285/p285_337|went on sale.
p285/p285_152|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p285/p285_343|I got a yellow card.
p285/p285_189|There is no openness.
p285/p285_396|What happened in the summer?
p285/p285_357|It is a memorial.
p285/p285_192|It caused a lot of upset.
p226/p226_119|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p226/p226_090|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p226/p226_305|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p226/p226_215|I am delighted for Simon.
p226/p226_071|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p226/p226_109|Oil embargo endorsed.
p226/p226_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p226/p226_328|That's the law of the land.
p226/p226_252|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p226/p226_055|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p226/p226_261|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p226/p226_197|There was no option.
p226/p226_177|I took the gun.
p226/p226_346|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p226/p226_299|There was no hint of scandal.
p226/p226_256|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p226/p226_036|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p226/p226_286|Yet, it worked.
p226/p226_354|That is a break with tradition.
p226/p226_338|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p226/p226_202|They are in the euro.
p226/p226_120|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p226/p226_330|The weekly average was three hours.
p226/p226_065|You do not change overnight.
p226/p226_352|His contract was then not renewed.
p226/p226_228|I am immensely sad.
p226/p226_129|She has been shot.
p226/p226_204|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p226/p226_047|We need to chat.
p226/p226_172|It became a book by itself.
p226/p226_218|I was so nervous.
p226/p226_227|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p226/p226_284|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p226/p226_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p226/p226_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p226/p226_287|Who will perform?
p226/p226_244|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p226/p226_078|There could be a way back.
p226/p226_134|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p226/p226_049|But it might have done.
p226/p226_316|The whole region is in shock.
p226/p226_255|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p226/p226_312|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p226/p226_276|It's a way of life.
p226/p226_080|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p226/p226_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p226/p226_300|I thought it was my only chance.
p226/p226_040|It was clear.
p226/p226_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p226/p226_349|He's been the key to everything.
p226/p226_178|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p226/p226_291|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p226/p226_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p226/p226_331|Donald was his friend.
p226/p226_141|Our intentions are real.
p226/p226_027|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p226/p226_315|It was a question of patience.
p226/p226_096|However, it did not end that way.
p226/p226_091|Someone who cares
p226/p226_171|A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
p226/p226_155|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p226/p226_238|Hospitals are for the ill.
p226/p226_355|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p226/p226_121|Maybe this battle has been.
p226/p226_180|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p226/p226_257|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p226/p226_042|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p226/p226_175|It is not either national standards or local control.
p226/p226_236|It is set in Paris.
p226/p226_240|She is well balanced.
p226/p226_083|It works for us.
p226/p226_207|It's a mixture of everything.
p226/p226_085|It can be halted.
p226/p226_075|Painful, but only because it's true.
p226/p226_124|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p226/p226_307|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p226/p226_056|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p226/p226_062|This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
p226/p226_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p226/p226_048|It's a blessing.
p226/p226_214|I'm pleased about one thing.
p226/p226_179|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p226/p226_283|He looked very sharp.
p226/p226_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p226/p226_337|I'd like to take the plunge.
p226/p226_254|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p226/p226_266|The warning is timely.
p226/p226_232|My wife and family are the support system.
p226/p226_136|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p226/p226_192|People will ask about us.
p226/p226_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p226/p226_063|It's a real challenge.
p226/p226_030|Because we do not need it.
p226/p226_308|This is a war over our home.
p226/p226_306|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p226/p226_089|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p226/p226_105|May not have been at fault?
p226/p226_366|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p226/p226_310|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p226/p226_365|I have got a wife to feed.
p226/p226_253|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p226/p226_341|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p226/p226_108|That time is not now, however.
p226/p226_107|It was a good performance.
p226/p226_140|They made such decisions in London.
p226/p226_069|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p226/p226_357|I kept going for her.
p226/p226_187|I had a train to catch.
p226/p226_234|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p226/p226_185|It is not fair.
p226/p226_269|They are never here.
p226/p226_319|Craig is a major concern for us.
p226/p226_293|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p226/p226_153|That group reported just before Christmas.
p226/p226_151|We have seen a copy of the report.
p226/p226_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p226/p226_054|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p226/p226_235|Police later said the scheme would end in November.
p226/p226_334|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p226/p226_360|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p226/p226_093|It's never too late.
p226/p226_079|Neither it is.
p226/p226_359|He's very explosive.
p226/p226_190|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p226/p226_143|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p226/p226_061|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p226/p226_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p226/p226_152|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p226/p226_067|It's a matter of balance.
p226/p226_271|He was popular.
p226/p226_325|I am very happy to be here.
p226/p226_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p226/p226_144|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p226/p226_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p226/p226_329|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p226/p226_102|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p226/p226_045|This represents a tough game for us.
p226/p226_112|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p226/p226_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p226/p226_070|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p226/p226_335|The boat was fantastic.
p226/p226_128|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p226/p226_258|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p226/p226_160|They should stop the bombing.
p226/p226_001|Please call Stella.
p226/p226_053|He had no enemies.
p226/p226_212|They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
p226/p226_132|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p226/p226_106|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p226/p226_356|She is free.
p226/p226_082|It is a terrible place.
p226/p226_347|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p226/p226_223|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p226/p226_208|I don't want to use it.
p226/p226_326|The airport was even different.
p226/p226_158|We will turn the corner.
p226/p226_237|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p226/p226_245|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p226/p226_072|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p226/p226_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p226/p226_113|The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
p226/p226_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p226/p226_367|Equity declined to comment.
p226/p226_270|We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
p226/p226_073|The script was funny.
p226/p226_279|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p226/p226_345|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p226/p226_146|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p226/p226_320|The home team had an amazing start.
p226/p226_220|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p226/p226_278|I feel pretty good.
p226/p226_344|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p226/p226_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p226/p226_249|I should think so, too.
p226/p226_174|It's quite a routine.
p226/p226_318|Kids are terrible.
p226/p226_247|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p226/p226_216|His third goal was superb.
p226/p226_268|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
p226/p226_133|She really suffered for her art.
p226/p226_194|It is a case of taking a risk.
p226/p226_311|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p226/p226_290|Scotland were beaten again.
p226/p226_159|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p226/p226_157|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p226/p226_046|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p226/p226_052|It is the whole package.
p226/p226_265|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p226/p226_037|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p226/p226_110|Before the game we went for a pint.
p226/p226_099|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p226/p226_301|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p226/p226_201|The service from the other players was super.
p226/p226_313|The minister is the engineer.
p226/p226_183|I have no sympathy with her at all.
p226/p226_188|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p226/p226_198|Is that it?
p226/p226_092|It's just awful.
p226/p226_370|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p226/p226_186|It just came into my head that day.
p226/p226_138|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p226/p226_142|Government will intervene.
p226/p226_369|He took over our lives.
p226/p226_163|I've learned from my mistakes.
p226/p226_169|Nobody did in those days.
p226/p226_206|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p226/p226_088|Detection is often difficult.
p226/p226_162|It is an attitude of mind.
p226/p226_362|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p226/p226_239|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p226/p226_193|The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
p226/p226_217|It's not ideal.
p226/p226_149|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p226/p226_148|Three penalties were given.
p226/p226_165|We have to move forward.
p226/p226_267|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p226/p226_368|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p226/p226_292|It goes back a long way.
p226/p226_333|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p226/p226_145|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p226/p226_280|He has a wealth of experience.
p226/p226_154|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p226/p226_211|But I am a worried man.
p226/p226_104|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p226/p226_302|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p226/p226_264|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p226/p226_122|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p226/p226_243|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p226/p226_156|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p226/p226_166|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p226/p226_274|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p226/p226_150|We just had a go.
p226/p226_224|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p226/p226_288|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p226/p226_317|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p226/p226_076|Help is needed.
p226/p226_195|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p226/p226_229|I'd never seen a play about me.
p226/p226_200|Is that success?
p226/p226_263|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p226/p226_059|She's a spy!
p226/p226_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p226/p226_103|They were outside the circle.
p226/p226_199|We live by the rule of law.
p226/p226_272|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p226/p226_281|It happens from time to time.
p226/p226_032|I was an athlete.
p226/p226_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p226/p226_050|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p226/p226_336|It is a time bomb.
p226/p226_135|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p226/p226_095|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p226/p226_025|He has not been named.
p226/p226_043|Is there a new way forward?
p226/p226_137|It will be too hot.
p226/p226_114|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p226/p226_289|This is a national crisis.
p226/p226_260|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p226/p226_131|I was furious.
p226/p226_262|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p226/p226_231|The track is currently covered in snow.
p226/p226_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p226/p226_339|My view has now completely changed.
p226/p226_115|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p226/p226_251|There's the mix.
p226/p226_041|It is not for any other purpose.
p226/p226_309|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p226/p226_184|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p226/p226_044|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p226/p226_031|This is the window.
p226/p226_363|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p226/p226_077|Tommy is not a problem.
p226/p226_358|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p226/p226_086|This is the way things should be handled.
p226/p226_100|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p226/p226_033|From that day on we started to look for another full back.
p226/p226_126|It is a delight on every level.
p226/p226_066|Art is extra.
p226/p226_060|It is unique.
p226/p226_294|The results are sometimes contentious.
p226/p226_094|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p226/p226_167|They will do their own thing.
p226/p226_303|One was a lawyer.
p226/p226_226|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p226/p226_051|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p226/p226_248|I was shocked.
p226/p226_246|His body was never found.
p226/p226_097|We could not get any possession.
p226/p226_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p226/p226_233|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p226/p226_101|It was mayhem.
p226/p226_191|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p226/p226_068|Scotland had great assets.
p226/p226_161|These days are long gone.
p226/p226_364|This is a club on the rise.
p226/p226_029|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p226/p226_189|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p226/p226_118|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p226/p226_127|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p226/p226_332|I am so upset.
p226/p226_298|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p226/p226_209|Now, it's all right.
p226/p226_225|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p226/p226_348|Look at the witnesses.
p226/p226_139|I am now unemployed.
p226/p226_173|His team management was protective.
p226/p226_342|Three years ago he would have been.
p226/p226_343|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p226/p226_241|They are all bright and different.
p226/p226_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p226/p226_213|Feel the heat?
p226/p226_130|I thought it was a fantastic game.
p226/p226_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p226/p226_314|I did not name it.
p226/p226_039|It has failed.
p226/p226_295|He should have won.
p226/p226_304|Our task is to complete the picture.
p226/p226_323|He said she was mad.
p226/p226_181|I've been there.
p226/p226_098|If you could find it.
p226/p226_321|My body is clearly capable.
p226/p226_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p226/p226_176|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p226/p226_064|It is not great art.
p226/p226_259|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p226/p226_074|You need a trademark.
p226/p226_205|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p226/p226_221|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p226/p226_273|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p226/p226_210|It's like a garage.
p226/p226_327|We do the same.
p226/p226_058|Next league matches Celtic.
p226/p226_111|It was an adventure.
p226/p226_285|It was a virus.
p226/p226_230|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p226/p226_242|It's only fair.
p226/p226_125|She's got to say something.
p226/p226_028|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p226/p226_117|I don't have many friends.
p226/p226_361|Our numbers are small.
p226/p226_340|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p226/p226_164|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p226/p226_203|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p226/p226_084|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p226/p226_353|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p226/p226_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p226/p226_351|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p226/p226_322|Referees are easy targets.
p226/p226_026|That's no bad thing.
p226/p226_057|It's the big omission.
p226/p226_219|I might come back.
p226/p226_324|We are in the end game.
p226/p226_168|It is too much for me.
p226/p226_116|It is normal.
p226/p226_297|There's a pause.
p226/p226_350|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p250/p250_163|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p250/p250_472|He certainly did a good job!
p250/p250_188|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p250/p250_206|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p250/p250_152|We will try to find someone.
p250/p250_276|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p250/p250_217|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p250/p250_268|That was a disgraceful performance.
p250/p250_298|He has not created a Festival resource.
p250/p250_440|THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
p250/p250_220|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p250/p250_430|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p250/p250_382|She is obviously very disappointed.
p250/p250_475|At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
p250/p250_321|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p250/p250_458|They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
p250/p250_026|Meetings will also remain private.
p250/p250_084|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p250/p250_092|That view is held by many others within the industry.
p250/p250_077|He was a lovely man.
p250/p250_134|It isn't a happy memory.
p250/p250_184|They could not match it.
p250/p250_481|Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
p250/p250_494|I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
p250/p250_253|There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
p250/p250_350|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p250/p250_073|It wasn't possible to relax.
p250/p250_036|It was just appalling luck.
p250/p250_351|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p250/p250_455|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p250/p250_249|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p250/p250_230|My daughter is an adult.
p250/p250_043|This represents a tough game for us.
p250/p250_136|Failure is not an option.
p250/p250_241|That you can do it.
p250/p250_413|I had a fortunate war.
p250/p250_194|Miller was every bit as happy.
p250/p250_057|I expect a rapid response.
p250/p250_432|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p250/p250_301|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p250/p250_478|Well, he is an artist.
p250/p250_187|This championship is different from the other majors.
p250/p250_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p250/p250_053|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p250/p250_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p250/p250_101|Are you from the rugby?
p250/p250_040|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p250/p250_262|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p250/p250_062|We have to keep our clients.
p250/p250_493|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p250/p250_391|The team hadn't been picked.
p250/p250_443|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p250/p250_054|I had trouble with the producers.
p250/p250_364|Three years ago he would have been.
p250/p250_290|I feel really confident in that department.
p250/p250_267|We've had several problems over injuries.
p250/p250_398|He has earned the right to their respect.
p250/p250_037|Rugby has an extended run.
p250/p250_393|One-third of the places are already taken.
p250/p250_446|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p250/p250_103|It is an old family habit.
p250/p250_221|That might help a bit.
p250/p250_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p250/p250_388|How do you take them away?
p250/p250_313|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p250/p250_486|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p250/p250_228|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p250/p250_326|McNaughton was not so sure.
p250/p250_192|This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
p250/p250_295|We shall rely on human beings.
p250/p250_193|They need to look after themselves.
p250/p250_485|And rugby fans can help.
p250/p250_074|We need to increase the membership.
p250/p250_107|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p250/p250_133|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p250/p250_110|They must be on commission.
p250/p250_236|It's just a normal life.
p250/p250_061|Let's hope that it does.
p250/p250_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p250/p250_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p250/p250_105|He was released after treatment.
p250/p250_294|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p250/p250_471|I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
p250/p250_090|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
p250/p250_385|We will win the argument.
p250/p250_325|There's still no-one like him.
p250/p250_283|I felt about this big.
p250/p250_161|Life is still very tough for them.
p250/p250_338|And he goes with it.
p250/p250_148|I had decided to quit the show.
p250/p250_416|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p250/p250_078|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p250/p250_409|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p250/p250_408|Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
p250/p250_401|The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
p250/p250_032|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p250/p250_469|The move is considered a major breakthrough.
p250/p250_087|They lived for their children.
p250/p250_038|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p250/p250_222|Does the name matter?
p250/p250_147|You are a gambling man.
p250/p250_328|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p250/p250_403|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p250/p250_143|My life has changed a lot.
p250/p250_352|The pain is still acute.
p250/p250_113|Mr Wilson has received no such request.
p250/p250_033|He works at the airport.
p250/p250_135|We have a team to reach the final.
p250/p250_117|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p250/p250_239|It is good for our team.
p250/p250_191|Our fans have been marvellous.
p250/p250_369|He had no access to the database.
p250/p250_047|So is that it, then?
p250/p250_251|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p250/p250_064|Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
p250/p250_324|Holland won by five wickets.
p250/p250_270|It was a kind of contempt.
p250/p250_242|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p250/p250_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p250/p250_363|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p250/p250_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p250/p250_435|No date has been fixed for his return.
p250/p250_412|Neither man has been charged.
p250/p250_310|You have to expect this type of thing.
p250/p250_476|I have always believed in myself.
p250/p250_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p250/p250_081|It makes for an interesting conference.
p250/p250_089|I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
p250/p250_144|We did what we had to do.
p250/p250_357|Finally came the moment of truth.
p250/p250_151|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p250/p250_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p250/p250_339|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p250/p250_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p250/p250_343|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p250/p250_495|We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
p250/p250_311|Stephen will get his first cap.
p250/p250_080|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p250/p250_462|Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
p250/p250_299|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p250/p250_278|They are interior designers and architects.
p250/p250_400|There was a substantial explosion.
p250/p250_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p250/p250_116|He was prepared for this.
p250/p250_212|It gave no further details.
p250/p250_027|I am pretty careful with money.
p250/p250_225|I think, therefore I am?
p250/p250_362|Is there a waiting list?
p250/p250_285|was everything done to save people?
p250/p250_367|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p250/p250_366|Look at the Liberal Democrats.
p250/p250_106|We have made no final decisions.
p250/p250_223|how do you get it back?
p250/p250_070|I am about protecting the state pension.
p250/p250_137|She's got to say something.
p250/p250_146|You've got to be vigilant.
p250/p250_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p250/p250_169|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p250/p250_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p250/p250_119|No, the equipment is extra.
p250/p250_096|Why do it otherwise?
p250/p250_173|Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
p250/p250_327|I was brought up in a mining background.
p250/p250_174|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p250/p250_235|The process will start tomorrow.
p250/p250_396|The marshall at the turn was great.
p250/p250_093|The excitement could hardly be contained.
p250/p250_342|The letters are going out today.
p250/p250_034|Smoking is also very important.
p250/p250_365|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p250/p250_360|What form did that take?
p250/p250_456|But we have built a platform for next season.
p250/p250_063|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p250/p250_069|Only water is currently allowed.
p250/p250_397|There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
p250/p250_474|I am certainly thinking about retirement.
p250/p250_030|This is a central issue.
p250/p250_287|Do I think about them often?
p250/p250_349|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p250/p250_463|Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
p250/p250_378|She said they would appeal.
p250/p250_189|It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
p250/p250_126|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p250/p250_374|It's fantastic to win again.
p250/p250_207|You could feel the heat.
p250/p250_167|People were actually not on his side.
p250/p250_001|Please call Stella.
p250/p250_237|The transaction is not feasible.
p250/p250_491|IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
p250/p250_243|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p250/p250_417|It became a national network.
p250/p250_483|That argument has been won.
p250/p250_261|He was good, but not that good.
p250/p250_334|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p250/p250_354|It's wonderful to have won.
p250/p250_170|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p250/p250_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p250/p250_202|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p250/p250_414|The choice is strictly personal.
p250/p250_068|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p250/p250_439|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p250/p250_245|They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
p250/p250_109|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p250/p250_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p250/p250_244|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p250/p250_461|The budget was too low for that.
p250/p250_404|It has only been rumours.
p250/p250_433|First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
p250/p250_083|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p250/p250_035|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p250/p250_332|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p250/p250_175|He was asked to quit.
p250/p250_306|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p250/p250_150|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p250/p250_196|It was a bit like having children.
p250/p250_479|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p250/p250_108|We knew they could do it.
p250/p250_302|It was an easy decision to come here.
p250/p250_335|It was nice to finish in style.
p250/p250_305|Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
p250/p250_138|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p250/p250_200|We always felt we could win.
p250/p250_490|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p250/p250_172|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p250/p250_162|It is not just about pay.
p250/p250_227|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p250/p250_056|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p250/p250_380|There is no deal as yet.
p250/p250_183|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p250/p250_254|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p250/p250_111|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p250/p250_411|We're not taking any risks.
p250/p250_232|It will affect their work.
p250/p250_176|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p250/p250_132|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p250/p250_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p250/p250_336|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p250/p250_181|That would open the gates of hell.
p250/p250_210|And we have the experience.
p250/p250_341|Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
p250/p250_465|Let that be their memorial.
p250/p250_042|No meaningful response was issued.
p250/p250_185|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p250/p250_389|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p250/p250_371|I was delighted to accept.
p250/p250_252|The most important thing is the game.
p250/p250_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p250/p250_085|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p250/p250_482|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p250/p250_480|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p250/p250_098|So, did she meet him?
p250/p250_160|He was pleased with his display.
p250/p250_444|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p250/p250_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p250/p250_460|It was like someone had died.
p250/p250_331|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p250/p250_309|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p250/p250_088|Potions said he would drive.
p250/p250_376|The salary changes are long overdue.
p250/p250_082|I've had it for the exams.
p250/p250_320|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p250/p250_337|Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
p250/p250_319|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p250/p250_346|He has made his base in Spain.
p250/p250_271|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p250/p250_447|External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
p250/p250_099|So what is the campaign about?
p250/p250_263|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
p250/p250_123|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p250/p250_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p250/p250_477|The chief constable has retired.
p250/p250_066|We will pay their bills.
p250/p250_434|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p250/p250_231|His third goal was superb.
p250/p250_067|We are talking about the outskirts of London.
p250/p250_381|It's as wide as a church in here.
p250/p250_489|He is not a dancer.
p250/p250_044|I made a terrible start.
p250/p250_345|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p250/p250_216|It was worth a photograph.
p250/p250_387|Does it matter?
p250/p250_333|The party lasted all night.
p250/p250_204|We are going through difficult times.
p250/p250_071|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p250/p250_257|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
p250/p250_274|Messages have to be reinforced.
p250/p250_265|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p250/p250_468|It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
p250/p250_258|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p250/p250_129|I have learned from him.
p250/p250_076|I was as strong as a horse.
p250/p250_436|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p250/p250_377|Those people must be accountable.
p250/p250_340|There will be good prospects ahead.
p250/p250_445|Everything in golf is a balance.
p250/p250_406|Rugby is a hard game.
p250/p250_353|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p250/p250_250|She will attend in July.
p250/p250_195|They were seriously after him.
p250/p250_300|I understand the security issue.
p250/p250_438|National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
p250/p250_379|The countryside is in crisis.
p250/p250_046|How are you, sir?
p250/p250_072|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p250/p250_280|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p250/p250_488|The Israeli military denied the claim.
p250/p250_158|What do we want to do that for?
p250/p250_308|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p250/p250_484|It was a narrow escape.
p250/p250_226|Who was she?
p250/p250_473|Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
p250/p250_421|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p250/p250_420|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p250/p250_315|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p250/p250_451|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p250/p250_286|What was the matter for concern?
p250/p250_179|You will be very welcome.
p250/p250_361|Are they free?
p250/p250_214|I won't make an official complaint.
p250/p250_316|I wanted to change the formula.
p250/p250_329|The takeover comes as no surprise.
p250/p250_164|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p250/p250_273|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p250/p250_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p250/p250_045|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p250/p250_492|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p250/p250_139|This is a frightening development.
p250/p250_097|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p250/p250_118|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p250/p250_190|The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
p250/p250_130|The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
p250/p250_140|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p250/p250_356|I'd like to take the plunge.
p250/p250_065|This is the first step.
p250/p250_466|The boys are mentally focused.
p250/p250_392|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p250/p250_091|We are progressing with a few interested parties.
p250/p250_312|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p250/p250_234|I am considered a teenager.
p250/p250_288|Is it in the right place?
p250/p250_304|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p250/p250_079|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
p250/p250_186|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p250/p250_297|We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
p250/p250_266|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p250/p250_289|It is also very valuable.
p250/p250_418|It is a large number.
p250/p250_247|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p250/p250_211|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p250/p250_154|What happened in that game?
p250/p250_457|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p250/p250_050|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p250/p250_177|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p250/p250_165|It has become a way of life.
p250/p250_368|We put our bid in last night.
p250/p250_131|He thought she was amazing.
p250/p250_323|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p250/p250_157|Why change it?
p250/p250_264|He is a reporter for us.
p250/p250_394|I always knew she was funny.
p250/p250_464|The damage is all inside.
p250/p250_255|The right decision has been made.
p250/p250_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p250/p250_248|I have spoken to the skipper.
p250/p250_155|Are you going to win?
p250/p250_422|The BBC was a disgrace.
p250/p250_496|Subsidy income will not be affected.
p250/p250_405|I was conceived in Aberdeen.
p250/p250_156|Was it the wife?
p250/p250_402|Theatre is not a museum.
p250/p250_383|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p250/p250_149|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p250/p250_344|We will listen to any suggestion.
p250/p250_238|I wouldn't even respond to that question.
p250/p250_094|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p250/p250_487|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p250/p250_442|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p250/p250_205|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p250/p250_197|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p250/p250_453|But you can go beyond that condition.
p250/p250_120|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p250/p250_052|Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
p250/p250_233|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p250/p250_277|We accept the new rules.
p250/p250_171|They have not been named.
p250/p250_454|The removal would take place in France.
p250/p250_168|The defender made an impressive debut.
p250/p250_348|A Home Office spokesman said.
p250/p250_269|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p250/p250_425|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p250/p250_159|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p250/p250_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p250/p250_291|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p250/p250_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p250/p250_198|We represent a wide range of society.
p250/p250_272|I should think so, too.
p250/p250_322|The effect was almost magical.
p250/p250_039|Costs have got to be controlled.
p250/p250_275|I got a yellow card.
p250/p250_240|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p250/p250_449|That will be best for him.
p250/p250_166|The whole industry is a shambles.
p250/p250_419|She started to put on weight.
p250/p250_281|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p250/p250_399|The law would appear to be on our side.
p250/p250_410|Growth will come later in the cycle.
p250/p250_215|British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
p250/p250_224|What are you not good at?
p250/p250_219|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p250/p250_141|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p250/p250_426|The second goal was superb.
p250/p250_246|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p250/p250_048|Do I have a favourite?
p250/p250_028|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p250/p250_437|The trial will open today.
p250/p250_102|Had I heard?
p250/p250_182|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p250/p250_209|It was a moment of madness.
p250/p250_292|Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
p250/p250_114|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p250/p250_318|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p250/p250_448|The people around me were fantastic.
p250/p250_260|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p250/p250_330|Job losses were also announced.
p250/p250_355|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p250/p250_142|That is far too high.
p250/p250_060|There's still plenty time left.
p250/p250_180|It had so much to do with output.
p250/p250_407|My immune system had been depleted.
p250/p250_384|They will fight for everything.
p250/p250_128|That's not an assumption that I had made.
p250/p250_450|And we might go back.
p250/p250_359|Is our children learning?
p250/p250_086|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p250/p250_467|This is the stuff of live music.
p250/p250_100|And does it?
p250/p250_395|Everyone could see the joke.
p250/p250_208|We have to be happy with a British and European record.
p250/p250_121|Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
p250/p250_104|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p250/p250_199|He was rejected because he had retired.
p250/p250_358|We have very limited capacity.
p250/p250_372|They should take their mobile phones.
p250/p250_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p250/p250_051|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p250/p250_201|It may have been a cry for help.
p250/p250_125|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p250/p250_115|It's good to have a voice.
p250/p250_431|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p250/p250_031|We will not tolerate it.
p250/p250_127|I understand the medical concerns.
p250/p250_375|We are really good friends.
p250/p250_370|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p250/p250_415|It's too close to call.
p250/p250_424|The next few months will tell.
p250/p250_390|After the match, do you?
p250/p250_428|There is a solution, she believes.
p250/p250_427|I am astonished at attack.
p250/p250_153|She died at her home.
p250/p250_293|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p250/p250_314|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p250/p250_423|Russell is delighted with them.
p250/p250_441|There were a lot of emotions.
p250/p250_282|We are aiming for early March.
p250/p250_058|She said she was really sorry.
p250/p250_284|And they were being paid?
p250/p250_429|That was the agreement with the manager.
p250/p250_317|He will address the nation this evening.
p250/p250_229|It had all been arranged.
p250/p250_049|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p250/p250_296|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p250/p250_178|I'd love to be like Peter.
p250/p250_459|The jury is still out.
p250/p250_075|There's nothing they can get on me.
p250/p250_386|Is it worth it?
p250/p250_055|The teacher would have approved.
p250/p250_218|It carried a double message.
p250/p250_095|It is high time to act.
p250/p250_124|Before the game we went for a pint.
p250/p250_059|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p250/p250_452|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p330/p330_322|We are all family men with children.
p330/p330_361|Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
p330/p330_143|That is the last thing they need.
p330/p330_273|However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
p330/p330_405|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p330/p330_163|I was delighted with every one of them.
p330/p330_218|You remember how long he lasted?
p330/p330_145|The results are sometimes contentious.
p330/p330_192|Referees are easy targets.
p330/p330_149|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p330/p330_314|There's a lot of hysteria.
p330/p330_096|What do we do for an encore?
p330/p330_065|We have to expand.
p330/p330_146|I never thought it would take this long.
p330/p330_402|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p330/p330_387|Was it just negligent.
p330/p330_216|We are not far from a deal.
p330/p330_296|For now, we must take one game at a time.
p330/p330_098|Many other Scottish locations also feature.
p330/p330_264|He will decide tomorrow.
p330/p330_090|Everything has the potential to be serious.
p330/p330_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p330/p330_238|We have great team spirit.
p330/p330_155|His parenthood is called into question.
p330/p330_041|This advice was accepted by ministers.
p330/p330_083|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p330/p330_384|So people will come out with these things.
p330/p330_029|That was their attitude.
p330/p330_385|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p330/p330_250|The board of governors must act.
p330/p330_103|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p330/p330_032|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p330/p330_159|I'm really looking forward to it.
p330/p330_214|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p330/p330_259|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p330/p330_061|I find it rather oppressive.
p330/p330_376|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p330/p330_051|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p330/p330_355|I've got my own ideas.
p330/p330_365|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p330/p330_073|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p330/p330_228|All these women were actors.
p330/p330_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p330/p330_225|But it's just great to have won.
p330/p330_326|They were at her bedside when she died.
p330/p330_251|We must all play our part.
p330/p330_117|The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
p330/p330_235|That is the first thing we need.
p330/p330_180|He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
p330/p330_039|Or so she thought.
p330/p330_262|I played really well on the back nine.
p330/p330_308|We really need research to help with that.
p330/p330_078|The way ahead is not easy.
p330/p330_337|You let a lot of people down.
p330/p330_062|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p330/p330_190|We're not an employment agency.
p330/p330_144|Was society doing enough?
p330/p330_419|This is about the Orange Order.
p330/p330_388|That would open the gates of hell.
p330/p330_070|I let go the telephone and ran.
p330/p330_366|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p330/p330_063|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p330/p330_127|He was part of South Africa.
p330/p330_397|They are interior designers and architects.
p330/p330_400|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p330/p330_001|Please call Stella.
p330/p330_113|Don't say you have not been warned.
p330/p330_132|They want to avoid a flashpoint.
p330/p330_126|It's like a high school play.
p330/p330_301|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p330/p330_201|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p330/p330_396|Then  all was revealed.
p330/p330_112|Wallace was in at the deep end.
p330/p330_056|We shall not forget him.
p330/p330_109|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p330/p330_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p330/p330_076|I want to help other women.
p330/p330_413|Their welfare is very important to us.
p330/p330_150|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p330/p330_187|He went to see what he could learn.
p330/p330_305|They still have the dirty work to do.
p330/p330_279|It is always the same, isn't it?
p330/p330_031|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p330/p330_319|It's just that we see different things.
p330/p330_298|Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
p330/p330_207|I think the euro has slipped.
p330/p330_219|Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
p330/p330_294|Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
p330/p330_082|I am here to play football.
p330/p330_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p330/p330_254|That is a break with tradition.
p330/p330_057|And thought we would get away with it.
p330/p330_050|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p330/p330_185|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p330/p330_260|The question is, Is that a negative?
p330/p330_331|Yet the data is compelling.
p330/p330_171|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p330/p330_111|You just know it.
p330/p330_362|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p330/p330_390|The line-up is a tasty one.
p330/p330_383|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p330/p330_255|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p330/p330_358|The goal will stay with me forever.
p330/p330_403|They had given up on him.
p330/p330_350|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p330/p330_119|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p330/p330_345|Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
p330/p330_193|It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
p330/p330_268|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p330/p330_130|What do they pay to join the club?
p330/p330_386|I am not a happy man.
p330/p330_059|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p330/p330_373|He scored a touchdown.
p330/p330_204|She was right about the struggle.
p330/p330_342|It is like being a qualifier again.
p330/p330_106|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p330/p330_169|This is not a Scottish problem.
p330/p330_410|What does he want him to look like?
p330/p330_312|It was a cry for help.
p330/p330_092|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p330/p330_245|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p330/p330_071|It is also very valuable.
p330/p330_208|We began to walk down.
p330/p330_222|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p330/p330_394|They will now get that support.
p330/p330_336|Will he be given time?
p330/p330_353|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p330/p330_290|If convicted, they face the death penalty.
p330/p330_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p330/p330_100|Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
p330/p330_115|Seven children had lost both parents.
p330/p330_046|They said we were out of touch.
p330/p330_389|If only we had known.
p330/p330_359|Our people should be immune.
p330/p330_349|We are very very proud of Alain.
p330/p330_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p330/p330_140|He will be judged by his actions.
p330/p330_168|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p330/p330_293|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p330/p330_167|I was proud of our lads.
p330/p330_370|I have chosen to do this research.
p330/p330_374|He wouldn't do it.
p330/p330_253|It was to be published next month.
p330/p330_044|Our decision making was poor.
p330/p330_407|I am greatly encouraged.
p330/p330_339|The result today is an impasse.
p330/p330_392|She was my big sister.
p330/p330_114|Some were close to tears.
p330/p330_122|Some people still think she should be English.
p330/p330_378|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p330/p330_203|Our message was inclusive.
p330/p330_256|It could have been a hammering by now.
p330/p330_332|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p330/p330_310|It is extremely popular with families.
p330/p330_205|Only the scale of change differed.
p330/p330_300|We have to offer value for money.
p330/p330_183|Euro The single currency is a fact.
p330/p330_148|There was nothing else to match it.
p330/p330_089|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p330/p330_226|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p330/p330_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p330/p330_072|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p330/p330_272|I always knew she was funny.
p330/p330_286|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p330/p330_280|Who would take it now, after all this?
p330/p330_423|I have no problem with that.
p330/p330_391|He was located after going to Singapore.
p330/p330_302|Chris is big and jolly.
p330/p330_406|We will deal with the refugees.
p330/p330_101|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p330/p330_047|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p330/p330_341|One person was believed to have been hit.
p330/p330_411|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p330/p330_265|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p330/p330_416|You have to work with what you've got.
p330/p330_234|To a level which we consider appropriate.
p330/p330_093|This will be great for the young lads.
p330/p330_357|They might want to play.
p330/p330_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p330/p330_247|They are also exploited by the markets.
p330/p330_271|For this government, reform and resources go together.
p330/p330_142|The answer is with ourselves.
p330/p330_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p330/p330_151|They have worked with each other.
p330/p330_422|It's been a long, long journey.
p330/p330_328|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p330/p330_153|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p330/p330_086|Four minutes later, the show was over.
p330/p330_258|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p330/p330_239|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p330/p330_043|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p330/p330_173|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p330/p330_097|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p330/p330_340|It would have to be backdated.
p330/p330_105|The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
p330/p330_036|I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
p330/p330_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p330/p330_398|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p330/p330_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p330/p330_134|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p330/p330_418|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p330/p330_282|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p330/p330_404|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p330/p330_354|It is patently true.
p330/p330_064|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p330/p330_213|There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
p330/p330_297|That was quite an interesting part.
p330/p330_371|That's the law of the land.
p330/p330_287|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p330/p330_080|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p330/p330_164|Sure the COE is a cracking band.
p330/p330_210|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p330/p330_227|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p330/p330_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p330/p330_120|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p330/p330_267|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p330/p330_195|The luxury has been well used.
p330/p330_095|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p330/p330_177|I have no battle with the Scots.
p330/p330_303|It is quite an eye opener.
p330/p330_295|There were no formal announcements.
p330/p330_309|We all work for nothing.
p330/p330_360|It is simple and easy to use.
p330/p330_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p330/p330_104|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p330/p330_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p330/p330_211|The cold war is over.
p330/p330_074|This makes up for it.
p330/p330_209|I will not take you out of context.
p330/p330_191|It has all been positive.
p330/p330_401|WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
p330/p330_116|So, how will it be received in the US?
p330/p330_087|It was an easy decision to come here.
p330/p330_306|I do not want to wait until May.
p330/p330_075|This is purely financial.
p330/p330_220|Ordering online was very easy.
p330/p330_184|This is a dream come true for me.
p330/p330_058|I think they should have more respect.
p330/p330_367|I think we finished fifth.
p330/p330_200|This is a good result for them.
p330/p330_084|That is the crunch.
p330/p330_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p330/p330_028|Surely history will not repeat itself.
p330/p330_175|Scotland were beaten again.
p330/p330_344|Our biggest threat is the BBC.
p330/p330_364|This was another video cassette.
p330/p330_125|Who will perform?
p330/p330_215|It had to be more flexible.
p330/p330_189|A board of inquiry has already been convened.
p330/p330_317|Axis itself was created from that exercise.
p330/p330_178|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p330/p330_261|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p330/p330_067|We gave everything we had.
p330/p330_179|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p330/p330_324|We've had our problems at the club.
p330/p330_139|It's like a garage.
p330/p330_343|And he's the first to see that, and say that.
p330/p330_417|O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
p330/p330_052|He has one son and one daughter.
p330/p330_135|The reason, of course, was Iraq.
p330/p330_274|All kinds of things occur.
p330/p330_232|What happened to me last week was wrong.
p330/p330_240|A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
p330/p330_277|The film has also been superbly designed.
p330/p330_325|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p330/p330_346|She is very upset.
p330/p330_079|I could do a better job.
p330/p330_381|However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
p330/p330_081|An announcement will follow in due course.
p330/p330_335|It could have been just a quick fix.
p330/p330_292|Twaddle is a case in point.
p330/p330_188|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p330/p330_206|That was one very hard game.
p330/p330_030|It was nothing to do with my daughter.
p330/p330_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p330/p330_202|There was no time scale.
p330/p330_137|He was obviously very genuine.
p330/p330_338|It's annoying in a way.
p330/p330_299|Motion described it as a unique event.
p330/p330_162|The party lasted all night.
p330/p330_186|I think it'll be a great occasion.
p330/p330_197|Billie was yet to be born.
p330/p330_320|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p330/p330_154|That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
p330/p330_033|And it had two seats.
p330/p330_027|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p330/p330_372|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p330/p330_217|Are there muscular problems?
p330/p330_147|He changed my life.
p330/p330_170|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p330/p330_161|We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
p330/p330_165|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p330/p330_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p330/p330_068|I think it is a release of tension.
p330/p330_198|She died in hospital two hours later.
p330/p330_053|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p330/p330_233|I never made any offer to Mark.
p330/p330_252|I first met him last summer.
p330/p330_133|We are now in a safe place.
p330/p330_025|Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
p330/p330_054|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p330/p330_412|What is next?
p330/p330_393|Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
p330/p330_281|I felt really good until Friday.
p330/p330_395|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p330/p330_276|I expected these kind of questions.
p330/p330_172|After that, we made some changes.
p330/p330_166|It was horrible, but there is still more.
p330/p330_040|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p330/p330_278|It was fit for royalty.
p330/p330_249|Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
p330/p330_289|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p330/p330_136|It will be very useful for us.
p330/p330_415|She has now been registered as disabled.
p330/p330_329|I am not in denial.
p330/p330_321|I am very happy with life.
p330/p330_348|It was a poor performance.
p330/p330_333|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p330/p330_363|It is the way they work.
p330/p330_060|This is a big club.
p330/p330_285|There is precious little middle ground.
p330/p330_420|But it looks good for next year.
p330/p330_414|It's nothing to do with me.
p330/p330_229|I've got no secret.
p330/p330_327|I think we showed that after half time.
p330/p330_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p330/p330_176|Glasgow is a tour de force.
p330/p330_421|We will do so again.
p330/p330_223|I think it is a great idea.
p330/p330_157|But it could have been written for her.
p330/p330_288|They were both delightful to work with.
p330/p330_121|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p330/p330_069|This is a most serious matter.
p330/p330_158|His only reply was a laugh.
p330/p330_369|We know them as mobile telephones.
p330/p330_236|Will they ever reopen?
p330/p330_379|And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
p330/p330_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p330/p330_110|The money is not really our concern.
p330/p330_269|Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
p330/p330_118|Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
p330/p330_108|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p330/p330_316|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p330/p330_356|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p330/p330_399|However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
p330/p330_318|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p330/p330_257|Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
p330/p330_246|Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
p330/p330_347|We have to learn lessons from these things.
p330/p330_266|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p330/p330_291|It's now down in black and white.
p330/p330_124|Repayment is not part of the game.
p330/p330_088|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p330/p330_231|Craig is still suffering seizures.
p330/p330_160|A report will be issued by March.
p330/p330_323|The committee's remit is far reaching.
p330/p330_152|O, Is there a lot of blood?
p330/p330_037|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p330/p330_221|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p330/p330_241|We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
p330/p330_242|You would fall over, he said.
p330/p330_128|It's much more dynamic.
p330/p330_330|There is a solution, she believes.
p330/p330_380|Debate is not just talk.
p330/p330_315|The casualties were not named.
p330/p330_311|He will do very well.
p330/p330_408|They offer a kind of narrative.
p330/p330_181|She is on a life support machine.
p330/p330_212|I'd like to take the plunge.
p330/p330_107|I'm astonished the men were not injured.
p330/p330_199|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p330/p330_048|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p330/p330_123|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p330/p330_313|They also intend to travel today.
p330/p330_034|They could move in at any moment.
p330/p330_035|There were no reported injuries.
p330/p330_038|It is my nature.
p330/p330_094|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p330/p330_196|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p330/p330_351|There was no sign that anything was amiss.
p330/p330_382|Neither was involved in violence.
p330/p330_368|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p330/p330_409|You guys are not out of it yet.
p330/p330_045|Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
p330/p330_283|I am confident of the outcome this week.
p330/p330_091|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p330/p330_131|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p330/p330_248|The principle is quite clear.
p330/p330_270|That is our main aim.
p330/p330_156|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p330/p330_244|They should take their mobile phones.
p330/p330_026|I was backing him up.
p330/p330_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p330/p330_224|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p330/p330_352|It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
p330/p330_138|We told them in July.
p330/p330_141|No Briton has ever won.
p330/p330_304|It became a national network.
p330/p330_042|We did not even get a free kick.
p330/p330_194|No government has that right.
p330/p330_263|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p330/p330_307|The festival idea has been a great success.
p330/p330_377|We are waiting for them to calm down.
p330/p330_237|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p330/p330_375|I don't know exactly what happened.
p330/p330_066|Others may be trying to catch up.
p330/p330_284|Equity declined to comment.
p330/p330_099|There's nothing for the kids.
p330/p330_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p330/p330_182|The actor has met with Mandela.
p330/p330_174|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p330/p330_243|We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
p330/p330_275|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p330/p330_085|I did not want any damage to us.
p330/p330_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p330/p330_049|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p330/p330_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p330/p330_102|The feeling is marvellous.
p330/p330_230|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p330/p330_334|What are you waiting for?
p330/p330_129|The party will make up its own mind.
p330/p330_077|The problem is Labour.
p330/p330_055|Scotland had great assets.
p245/p245_045|Sure, it's funny.
p245/p245_092|He's a star.
p245/p245_236|You can feel at home in China.
p245/p245_315|They had a confession.
p245/p245_145|It has to be now.
p245/p245_167|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p245/p245_038|It has failed.
p245/p245_229|He was good, but not that good.
p245/p245_168|It is tough, but possible.
p245/p245_106|Who would be a referee?
p245/p245_301|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p245/p245_184|They are in the euro.
p245/p245_164|It is not fair.
p245/p245_085|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p245/p245_252|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p245/p245_281|He was obviously very genuine.
p245/p245_166|I had a train to catch.
p245/p245_098|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p245/p245_327|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p245/p245_057|None has ever been found.
p245/p245_189|That will be vital.
p245/p245_077|That is bound to happen.
p245/p245_156|The hotel was now for sale.
p245/p245_065|The script was funny.
p245/p245_226|It's quite a line-up!
p245/p245_271|She looked so young.
p245/p245_074|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p245/p245_243|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p245/p245_108|Who would have?
p245/p245_270|People have no choice.
p245/p245_219|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p245/p245_086|It is a lifeline.
p245/p245_265|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p245/p245_051|It's a blessing.
p245/p245_293|There was no hint of scandal.
p245/p245_104|I'm delighted about that.
p245/p245_071|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p245/p245_027|It's nice to hear.
p245/p245_097|It was an adventure.
p245/p245_224|It is not the message alone.
p245/p245_049|The boy is no longer with us.
p245/p245_060|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p245/p245_034|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p245/p245_204|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p245/p245_199|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p245/p245_206|But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
p245/p245_177|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p245/p245_126|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p245/p245_128|I was awful.
p245/p245_066|You need a trademark.
p245/p245_323|I saw some good things.
p245/p245_056|Sadly, it can't.
p245/p245_249|I can't get a job.
p245/p245_031|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p245/p245_348|They should take their mobile phones.
p245/p245_176|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p245/p245_182|The red card was okay.
p245/p245_123|Is that it?
p245/p245_124|He was in a great deal of pain.
p245/p245_075|What has changed?
p245/p245_238|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p245/p245_082|It's never too late.
p245/p245_228|This fact is supported by audience research.
p245/p245_251|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p245/p245_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p245/p245_275|You've got to have both sides.
p245/p245_197|His third goal was superb.
p245/p245_122|What will happen then?
p245/p245_140|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p245/p245_231|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p245/p245_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p245/p245_254|they fail to engage.
p245/p245_337|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p245/p245_062|He should have asked for a second opinion.
p245/p245_129|That group reported just before Christmas.
p245/p245_311|I never thought it would take this long.
p245/p245_246|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p245/p245_072|People must remain vigilant.
p245/p245_109|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p245/p245_355|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p245/p245_039|It was clear.
p245/p245_055|He had no enemies.
p245/p245_232|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p245/p245_345|He was then replaced by Ross.
p245/p245_256|I was happily surprised.
p245/p245_244|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p245/p245_026|But it failed.
p245/p245_091|They were outside the circle.
p245/p245_304|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p245/p245_076|I'd like to continue that record.
p245/p245_143|I've learned from my mistakes.
p245/p245_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p245/p245_240|I was shocked.
p245/p245_234|It's only fair.
p245/p245_235|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p245/p245_147|The release attracted little attention.
p245/p245_036|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p245/p245_269|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p245/p245_146|I was in the train station overnight.
p245/p245_326|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p245/p245_148|That will do for me.
p245/p245_198|It's been a good year.
p245/p245_133|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p245/p245_195|I began to pray.
p245/p245_333|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p245/p245_001|Please call Stella.
p245/p245_083|Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
p245/p245_080|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p245/p245_188|It's all about money, money, money.
p245/p245_318|There was no time scale.
p245/p245_287|That could change.
p245/p245_163|We did everything by the book.
p245/p245_261|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p245/p245_209|You have to do your research.
p245/p245_192|We don't even know his name.
p245/p245_253|It's that kind of place.
p245/p245_088|Then came the crunch.
p245/p245_276|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p245/p245_321|It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
p245/p245_121|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p245/p245_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p245/p245_087|The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
p245/p245_120|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p245/p245_190|Now, it's all right.
p245/p245_042|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p245/p245_050|Who can say?
p245/p245_344|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p245/p245_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p245/p245_116|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p245/p245_113|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p245/p245_272|It happens from time to time.
p245/p245_215|It's so special.
p245/p245_144|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p245/p245_154|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p245/p245_089|If you could find it.
p245/p245_217|I can't wait to meet him.
p245/p245_107|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p245/p245_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p245/p245_119|Who will attend?
p245/p245_245|This year I understood.
p245/p245_325|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p245/p245_125|We want to keep the pound.
p245/p245_185|He's not perfect.
p245/p245_227|I might get an injury very easily.
p245/p245_299|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p245/p245_341|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p245/p245_160|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p245/p245_233|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p245/p245_170|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p245/p245_202|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p245/p245_035|So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
p245/p245_319|My view has now completely changed.
p245/p245_203|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p245/p245_032|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p245/p245_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p245/p245_158|Everyone can be bought.
p245/p245_302|And he goes with it.
p245/p245_211|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p245/p245_046|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p245/p245_171|People will ask about us.
p245/p245_292|He has retired.
p245/p245_230|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p245/p245_334|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p245/p245_127|There is a lack of chemistry.
p245/p245_340|There's no place to hide.
p245/p245_172|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p245/p245_314|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p245/p245_165|What has caused the demise of singing?
p245/p245_339|I would miss him.
p245/p245_241|They are different types.
p245/p245_162|They will run a mile.
p245/p245_084|Now the system is right behind us.
p245/p245_138|Mr Blair had done well.
p245/p245_216|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p245/p245_142|Was this element always there?
p245/p245_282|It goes back a long way.
p245/p245_317|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p245/p245_094|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p245/p245_037|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p245/p245_131|He will emerge as a world leader.
p245/p245_356|It's not that clear-cut.
p245/p245_305|We want to play at the worlds.
p245/p245_174|However, he said the money had not been wasted.
p245/p245_354|It was very formal.
p245/p245_308|This is the culture change in medicine.
p245/p245_112|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p245/p245_283|The weather forecast isn't good.
p245/p245_266|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p245/p245_061|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p245/p245_336|Action is needed now.
p245/p245_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p245/p245_033|I was an athlete.
p245/p245_247|They need to look after themselves.
p245/p245_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p245/p245_295|Nothing is safe.
p245/p245_136|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p245/p245_300|It's just not funny!
p245/p245_332|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p245/p245_180|Is that success?
p245/p245_183|I have a cold.
p245/p245_335|The train was on time.
p245/p245_117|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p245/p245_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p245/p245_264|It left me with a sadness.
p245/p245_118|He has been under great pressure.
p245/p245_115|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p245/p245_346|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p245/p245_179|The conference is the first test.
p245/p245_316|I am very happy to be here.
p245/p245_187|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p245/p245_135|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p245/p245_218|My wife and family are the support system.
p245/p245_303|You are the glory.
p245/p245_277|It was a virus.
p245/p245_289|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p245/p245_178|It was still there, but right at the end.
p245/p245_193|Feel the heat?
p245/p245_309|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p245/p245_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p245/p245_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p245/p245_279|It's very safe.
p245/p245_357|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p245/p245_173|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p245/p245_284|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p245/p245_212|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p245/p245_053|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p245/p245_248|Is there on his hands?
p245/p245_285|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p245/p245_329|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p245/p245_175|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p245/p245_150|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p245/p245_353|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p245/p245_222|We were a load of rubbish.
p245/p245_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p245/p245_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p245/p245_259|I HAVE a dream.
p245/p245_207|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p245/p245_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p245/p245_028|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p245/p245_214|At the time, he was a living legend.
p245/p245_352|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p245/p245_263|Immediate action must be taken.
p245/p245_200|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p245/p245_290|This is a huge confidence boost.
p245/p245_320|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p245/p245_073|This is the way things should be handled.
p245/p245_291|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p245/p245_132|They did very well.
p245/p245_093|It was some time before she found out he was safe.
p245/p245_134|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p245/p245_350|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p245/p245_220|They had no children.
p245/p245_041|Indeed, he does.
p245/p245_294|I thought it was my only chance.
p245/p245_181|But we are not immune to the problem.
p245/p245_090|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p245/p245_079|We have other options.
p245/p245_059|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p245/p245_063|He was popular.
p245/p245_196|I had decided to quit the show.
p245/p245_047|This represents a tough game for us.
p245/p245_139|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p245/p245_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p245/p245_273|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p245/p245_105|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p245/p245_223|They should come forward.
p245/p245_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p245/p245_141|He can do no wrong.
p245/p245_313|Craig is a major concern for us.
p245/p245_130|It is not just about pay.
p245/p245_068|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p245/p245_191|It's like a garage.
p245/p245_161|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p245/p245_239|There wasn't a goal.
p245/p245_312|They wanted the club to make money.
p245/p245_095|Oil embargo endorsed.
p245/p245_099|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p245/p245_250|It is nearly there.
p245/p245_343|It was forced to divert.
p245/p245_296|They are wrong.
p245/p245_331|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p245/p245_242|It was a hit.
p245/p245_208|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p245/p245_280|Well, he can do it.
p245/p245_064|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p245/p245_347|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p245/p245_213|It was good fun.
p245/p245_016|Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p245/p245_149|Nobody did in those days.
p245/p245_029|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p245/p245_267|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p245/p245_268|Of course I was tempted.
p245/p245_043|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p245/p245_351|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p245/p245_081|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p245/p245_297|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p245/p245_260|It is set in Paris.
p245/p245_070|Is there a new way forward?
p245/p245_101|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p245/p245_103|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p245/p245_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p245/p245_225|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p245/p245_307|He was solid.
p245/p245_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p245/p245_237|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p245/p245_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p245/p245_262|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p245/p245_359|But nothing happened.
p245/p245_286|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p245/p245_210|Saturday is gone.
p245/p245_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p245/p245_349|It is not like working for a living.
p245/p245_110|We work on the same level.
p245/p245_040|It's a great thing.
p245/p245_048|We need to chat.
p245/p245_298|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p245/p245_054|They had to explain it.
p245/p245_310|It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
p245/p245_030|They should be so lucky.
p245/p245_274|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p245/p245_201|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p245/p245_102|I have had no social life at all.
p245/p245_306|We have waited a long time for this.
p245/p245_342|I'm very lucky.
p245/p245_278|Yet, it worked.
p245/p245_078|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p245/p245_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p245/p245_186|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p245/p245_221|We are in the hat.
p245/p245_338|Indeed, it was magical.
p245/p245_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p245/p245_137|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p245/p245_157|I drove the ball well.
p245/p245_044|But it took a lot of bottle.
p245/p245_058|It's a matter of balance.
p245/p245_330|Who will do it?
p245/p245_069|She died in hospital two hours later.
p245/p245_322|The boat was fantastic.
p245/p245_114|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p245/p245_111|I can't even get into the A team.
p245/p245_258|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p245/p245_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p245/p245_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p245/p245_096|No date has been set for the appeal.
p245/p245_194|He knows a lot.
p245/p245_358|He's very explosive.
p245/p245_288|The goals will come.
p245/p245_155|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p245/p245_152|It became a book by itself.
p245/p245_205|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p245/p245_328|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p245/p245_100|I was angry.
p245/p245_324|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p245/p245_151|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p262/p262_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p262/p262_226|At the time, he was a living legend.
p262/p262_368|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p262/p262_092|They are now divorced.
p262/p262_334|It could have gone either way.
p262/p262_119|Next season for every manager is a long time away.
p262/p262_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p262/p262_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p262/p262_375|I am a wealthy person.
p262/p262_275|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p262/p262_263|I saw one body.
p262/p262_323|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p262/p262_307|However, the groups denied the claims.
p262/p262_112|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p262/p262_392|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p262/p262_039|It was ugly.
p262/p262_369|Talks are progressing.
p262/p262_118|I felt very strongly that England should have it.
p262/p262_297|And huge, indeed, it is.
p262/p262_040|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p262/p262_278|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p262/p262_215|Work has started.
p262/p262_236|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p262/p262_090|Then came the crunch.
p262/p262_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p262/p262_186|That would be my view.
p262/p262_241|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p262/p262_230|But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
p262/p262_273|Things can change.
p262/p262_321|We are a peaceful people.
p262/p262_082|It's never too late.
p262/p262_081|Someone who cares
p262/p262_132|We need to chat.
p262/p262_279|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p262/p262_156|He's been the key to everything.
p262/p262_373|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p262/p262_184|Miller was every bit as happy.
p262/p262_051|Next league matches Celtic.
p262/p262_078|He is driven.
p262/p262_250|I was shocked.
p262/p262_044|It is difficult for Ali.
p262/p262_300|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p262/p262_333|It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
p262/p262_108|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p262/p262_155|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p262/p262_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p262/p262_298|The results are sometimes contentious.
p262/p262_363|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p262/p262_135|It would be a last resort.
p262/p262_070|Then followed a bout of flu.
p262/p262_178|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p262/p262_258|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p262/p262_083|Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
p262/p262_206|But I am a worried man.
p262/p262_136|That group reported just before Christmas.
p262/p262_096|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p262/p262_257|We run within the law.
p262/p262_382|It would be a massive boost for them.
p262/p262_159|As, indeed, they would be.
p262/p262_252|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p262/p262_255|That could be in place by next year.
p262/p262_388|They are good.
p262/p262_145|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p262/p262_150|They were later discharged from hospital.
p262/p262_380|We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
p262/p262_077|Detection is often difficult.
p262/p262_209|We'll have to work hard today.
p262/p262_065|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
p262/p262_123|It plans to return to this field.
p262/p262_175|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p262/p262_001|Please call Stella.
p262/p262_122|It was the same at Twickenham.
p262/p262_066|It is like a river running by my home.
p262/p262_265|They wanted the club to make money.
p262/p262_309|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p262/p262_353|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p262/p262_127|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p262/p262_330|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p262/p262_120|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p262/p262_376|Something is wrong.
p262/p262_205|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p262/p262_367|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p262/p262_086|Today I couldn't run on it.
p262/p262_201|They are in the euro.
p262/p262_163|It's that sort of night.
p262/p262_385|Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
p262/p262_097|It is a good day for the coalition.
p262/p262_383|The release attracted little attention.
p262/p262_296|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p262/p262_181|Nothing is safe.
p262/p262_249|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p262/p262_207|There was an e-mail.
p262/p262_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p262/p262_104|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p262/p262_144|Mr Blair had done well.
p262/p262_139|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p262/p262_277|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p262/p262_242|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p262/p262_246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p262/p262_286|The attacker died in the crash.
p262/p262_283|I saw it at a ruck.
p262/p262_046|I was angry.
p262/p262_312|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p262/p262_276|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p262/p262_061|There was a battle there.
p262/p262_048|They had to explain it.
p262/p262_053|It's very odd.
p262/p262_161|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p262/p262_154|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p262/p262_164|It is not too late to get on board.
p262/p262_339|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p262/p262_105|He pleaded for caution.
p262/p262_157|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p262/p262_272|It's not even finished.
p262/p262_188|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p262/p262_264|At first I thought I was gone.
p262/p262_329|We are in the end game.
p262/p262_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p262/p262_217|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p262/p262_140|It is huge.
p262/p262_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p262/p262_171|We've made a couple of albums.
p262/p262_212|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p262/p262_251|A friendship that will endure.
p262/p262_089|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p262/p262_091|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p262/p262_027|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p262/p262_233|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p262/p262_364|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p262/p262_125|The goals were good.
p262/p262_095|FOR once, you should believe the hype.
p262/p262_151|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p262/p262_274|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p262/p262_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p262/p262_202|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p262/p262_034|Life was like a timetable.
p262/p262_080|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p262/p262_050|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p262/p262_319|I never thought it would take this long.
p262/p262_063|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p262/p262_314|The letters are going out today.
p262/p262_062|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p262/p262_216|His death was a tragic accident.
p262/p262_331|The parents will have a great time, too.
p262/p262_285|He will address the nation this evening.
p262/p262_271|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p262/p262_290|The death toll included five children.
p262/p262_169|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p262/p262_116|Who would have?
p262/p262_315|We want to play at the worlds.
p262/p262_340|The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
p262/p262_076|I'd like to continue that record.
p262/p262_354|The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
p262/p262_302|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p262/p262_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p262/p262_064|He was popular.
p262/p262_280|We have to break that cycle.
p262/p262_031|I expected these kind of questions.
p262/p262_197|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p262/p262_059|And a film maker was born.
p262/p262_057|New York is expected to come to a standstill.
p262/p262_260|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p262/p262_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p262/p262_393|Emotions were complex.
p262/p262_355|A man has since been charged with his murder.
p262/p262_377|Mentally, you have to be tough.
p262/p262_374|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p262/p262_324|The problems began a long time ago.
p262/p262_060|I fell against him.
p262/p262_033|People love to see this stuff.
p262/p262_235|But it's a subtle process.
p262/p262_325|My body is clearly capable.
p262/p262_174|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p262/p262_088|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p262/p262_308|They should be swept away.
p262/p262_133|She died at her home.
p262/p262_288|The mood is good.
p262/p262_322|It should be equal.
p262/p262_168|The post will be unpaid.
p262/p262_270|It was an easy decision to come here.
p262/p262_055|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p262/p262_304|What has altered?
p262/p262_100|Oil embargo endorsed.
p262/p262_190|It wasn't to be.
p262/p262_221|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p262/p262_282|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p262/p262_075|What has changed?
p262/p262_224|The track is currently covered in snow.
p262/p262_243|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p262/p262_094|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p262/p262_029|We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
p262/p262_182|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p262/p262_310|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p262/p262_047|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p262/p262_141|I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
p262/p262_130|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p262/p262_259|This is a big club.
p262/p262_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p262/p262_111|This film will be totally awesome.
p262/p262_128|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p262/p262_387|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p262/p262_336|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p262/p262_238|He was good, but not that good.
p262/p262_351|There is no link.
p262/p262_124|Our intentions are real.
p262/p262_244|They may yet have the last laugh.
p262/p262_162|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p262/p262_229|It's that kind of place.
p262/p262_342|I would miss him.
p262/p262_391|This is a major step forward for carers.
p262/p262_352|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p262/p262_210|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p262/p262_267|Immediate action must be taken.
p262/p262_245|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p262/p262_254|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p262/p262_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p262/p262_361|We will be homeless.
p262/p262_170|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p262/p262_338|The team for the first game could be this one.
p262/p262_107|It's a shame.
p262/p262_067|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p262/p262_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p262/p262_106|They are ready.
p262/p262_087|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p262/p262_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p262/p262_386|We're looking for justice.
p262/p262_328|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p262/p262_284|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p262/p262_114|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p262/p262_335|He was then replaced by Ross.
p262/p262_266|We shall rely on human beings.
p262/p262_356|It is horrible.
p262/p262_110|They were behind the wheel.
p262/p262_101|It is a good lifestyle.
p262/p262_172|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p262/p262_394|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p262/p262_069|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p262/p262_054|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p262/p262_165|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p262/p262_350|I got a yellow card.
p262/p262_360|It was one in the afternoon.
p262/p262_143|Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
p262/p262_032|This is the window.
p262/p262_327|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p262/p262_196|The service from the other players was super.
p262/p262_365|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p262/p262_109|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p262/p262_213|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p262/p262_138|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p262/p262_166|We have a budget in March.
p262/p262_071|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p262/p262_026|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p262/p262_131|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p262/p262_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p262/p262_058|Jobs could go.
p262/p262_301|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p262/p262_158|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p262/p262_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p262/p262_222|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p262/p262_193|Our strategy is straightforward.
p262/p262_074|I've not thought about it.
p262/p262_359|He's very explosive.
p262/p262_248|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p262/p262_192|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p262/p262_191|I came home by ambulance.
p262/p262_121|So the European elections are extremely important.
p262/p262_103|It's not perfect.
p262/p262_214|He seemed to lose his focus.
p262/p262_211|I had decided to quit the show.
p262/p262_189|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p262/p262_357|The council said the house would have to be demolished.
p262/p262_068|It's all I can do.
p262/p262_043|It's a crucial award.
p262/p262_379|I was so nervous.
p262/p262_219|We have not given up hope.
p262/p262_269|He was also married with two children.
p262/p262_198|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p262/p262_305|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p262/p262_200|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p262/p262_231|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p262/p262_045|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p262/p262_085|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p262/p262_390|It was on fire.
p262/p262_370|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p262/p262_041|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p262/p262_204|There was no rescue.
p262/p262_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p262/p262_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p262/p262_194|The group is separate from the Real IRA.
p262/p262_113|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p262/p262_316|Is there on his hands?
p262/p262_042|The judge said.
p262/p262_099|Two of the team became ill.
p262/p262_126|Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
p262/p262_203|It's all about money, money, money.
p262/p262_056|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p262/p262_262|I am very angry.
p262/p262_306|One was a lawyer.
p262/p262_261|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p262/p262_303|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p262/p262_137|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p262/p262_326|He said she was mad.
p262/p262_293|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p262/p262_142|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p262/p262_347|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p262/p262_281|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p262/p262_372|It is a large number.
p262/p262_052|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p262/p262_240|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p262/p262_149|I knew he was good.
p262/p262_234|It is a terrible loss.
p262/p262_173|Is Saddam a threat?
p262/p262_320|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p262/p262_167|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p262/p262_291|Who did the recruiting?
p262/p262_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p262/p262_313|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p262/p262_332|I am so upset.
p262/p262_232|It's very safe.
p262/p262_179|That has been the easy part.
p262/p262_073|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p262/p262_152|Neither side can win this war.
p262/p262_247|The scene is about this?
p262/p262_295|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p262/p262_366|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p262/p262_180|He will need that machine.
p262/p262_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p262/p262_348|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p262/p262_185|I had a train to catch.
p262/p262_317|Special measures were needed.
p262/p262_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p262/p262_195|People acted too quickly.
p262/p262_220|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p262/p262_218|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p262/p262_079|All options are open.
p262/p262_311|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p262/p262_349|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p262/p262_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p262/p262_344|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p262/p262_345|It was forced to divert.
p262/p262_239|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p262/p262_183|They need to look after themselves.
p262/p262_117|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p262/p262_037|It was clear.
p262/p262_358|Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
p262/p262_268|It's very nice.
p262/p262_146|We should be clear about the role of government.
p262/p262_093|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p262/p262_381|However, it's good to turn the page.
p262/p262_343|It will be very, very tight.
p262/p262_362|That would help.
p262/p262_237|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p262/p262_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p262/p262_148|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p262/p262_292|Mr Campbell received a phone call.
p262/p262_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p262/p262_098|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p262/p262_384|It was important to win the singles.
p262/p262_134|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p262/p262_147|It is a freedom.
p262/p262_025|The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
p262/p262_072|I had my suspicions.
p262/p262_225|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p262/p262_102|It was an adventure.
p262/p262_337|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p262/p262_176|The clarity is vital.
p262/p262_084|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p262/p262_228|However, no further action was taken by police.
p262/p262_153|He can do no wrong.
p262/p262_160|They are not advertised.
p262/p262_199|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p262/p262_177|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p262/p262_378|I am very happy with life.
p262/p262_129|It's a question of fashion.
p262/p262_371|It was a funny game.
p262/p262_115|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p262/p262_038|The problem is the pitch.
p262/p262_256|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p262/p262_049|He had no enemies.
p262/p262_389|It was a breathtaking moment.
p262/p262_208|It's a big deal for me.
p262/p262_036|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p262/p262_253|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p262/p262_294|Well, he can do it.
p262/p262_187|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p262/p262_299|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p262/p262_227|The Dow Jones is way up.
p262/p262_289|This is a national crisis.
p262/p262_346|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p262/p262_287|It was a virus.
p262/p262_341|His views are hardly surprising.
p262/p262_223|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p262/p262_318|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p262/p262_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p313/p313_032|It was important to win the singles.
p313/p313_053|It was large enough to fit the wall.
p313/p313_408|I want to keep him.
p313/p313_152|I am ashamed of them.
p313/p313_132|He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
p313/p313_384|We have been preparing all year.
p313/p313_316|But then they scored their fourth.
p313/p313_386|I can't wait for the outdoors.
p313/p313_395|It's time to fight a decisive battle.
p313/p313_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p313/p313_404|I will never manage another Scottish club.
p313/p313_142|It's typical of me.
p313/p313_218|It's not a wish list.
p313/p313_206|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
p313/p313_065|The house was so well alight.
p313/p313_315|The odds are that it will.
p313/p313_336|He pleaded for caution.
p313/p313_128|What has changed since then?
p313/p313_392|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p313/p313_235|My body is exhausted.
p313/p313_087|Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
p313/p313_211|I suspect that it will.
p313/p313_126|What's the point?
p313/p313_229|It doesn't take much.
p313/p313_321|But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
p313/p313_165|Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
p313/p313_120|The Tory party will last.
p313/p313_100|They've just got to believe in themselves.
p313/p313_258|Or so everyone believed.
p313/p313_367|The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
p313/p313_248|I thought they could have made the gesture.
p313/p313_146|But the championship is not over yet.
p313/p313_312|I'm not a paedophile.
p313/p313_169|But what are the songs about?
p313/p313_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
p313/p313_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p313/p313_370|The hearing was fair.
p313/p313_307|I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
p313/p313_286|We're talking about the outskirts of London.
p313/p313_028|I intend to raise the matter there.
p313/p313_283|Funding needs to be long term.
p313/p313_393|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p313/p313_403|It would have been very easily done.
p313/p313_252|The man became a reporter.
p313/p313_210|Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
p313/p313_365|They took a risk.
p313/p313_389|That time is not far away.
p313/p313_227|That figure will always remain with me.
p313/p313_347|This morning was very quiet.
p313/p313_067|Sandy was very active.
p313/p313_368|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p313/p313_300|So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
p313/p313_153|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
p313/p313_361|Well, you can have a tree.
p313/p313_193|All these things have an impact.
p313/p313_242|I tried to push him away.
p313/p313_049|He was critically ill in hospital last night.
p313/p313_224|There is no margin for error.
p313/p313_233|They hold on for many years.
p313/p313_274|My mother is a widow.
p313/p313_406|It's going to be a new challenge.
p313/p313_117|They will be destroyed.
p313/p313_175|It was that kind of night.
p313/p313_324|The referee had a shocking game.
p313/p313_331|Everyone's too upset to comment.
p313/p313_234|Is it the shape of things to come?
p313/p313_192|Stan is a vital part of our future.
p313/p313_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p313/p313_344|It's a question of perception.
p313/p313_121|It was a journey into a new life.
p313/p313_098|Peter doesn't want to leave.
p313/p313_056|I've really noticed that this week.
p313/p313_144|They played it like a cup final.
p313/p313_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p313/p313_068|However, there is great potential in this right.
p313/p313_057|We might be back next year.
p313/p313_400|His primary residence is Scotland.
p313/p313_018|Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p313/p313_265|By this point the couple were approaching fast.
p313/p313_291|It's never over until it's over.
p313/p313_311|Could you put it in writing?
p313/p313_380|They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
p313/p313_124|Life, as many people know it, in other words.
p313/p313_202|It looks as though there is no chance.
p313/p313_421|It appears to have been closed down.
p313/p313_035|We are doing very well as we are.
p313/p313_409|He deserves a top team.
p313/p313_399|Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
p313/p313_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p313/p313_268|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p313/p313_305|SO now we know the secret.
p313/p313_222|If not, he should go home.
p313/p313_330|We are now in an election period.
p313/p313_074|But you can go beyond that condition.
p313/p313_140|But every two minutes it was exploding.
p313/p313_186|Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
p313/p313_156|If so, we want to hear from them.
p313/p313_052|What were they?
p313/p313_394|You can't go back and change things.
p313/p313_069|We have no idea what caused the derailment.
p313/p313_092|The crucial strike was yet to come.
p313/p313_048|We were very much a happy family.
p313/p313_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p313/p313_266|I had trouble with the producers.
p313/p313_217|He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
p313/p313_214|We are a party for people, not against people.
p313/p313_213|The squad will be the same for France.
p313/p313_362|It was the same at Twickenham.
p313/p313_181|I hope we do.
p313/p313_109|Nothing is being offered in exchange.
p313/p313_255|Our people are paying high prices.
p313/p313_025|They will be dealt with.
p313/p313_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p313/p313_054|He will be judged by his actions.
p313/p313_397|Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
p313/p313_419|I didn't play all that well.
p313/p313_115|Such a policy would be a disaster.
p313/p313_295|We gave them the goal.
p313/p313_118|We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
p313/p313_317|They deserve a lot of credit.
p313/p313_097|But Allen is deadly serious.
p313/p313_226|From our point of view, it's the right time.
p313/p313_354|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p313/p313_335|I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
p313/p313_376|She died at her home.
p313/p313_216|We're still paying the price for that.
p313/p313_236|Home is in the Scottish Borders.
p313/p313_289|I'm not a threat to coaches.
p313/p313_261|He was in contention almost every week.
p313/p313_285|I would never even consider it.
p313/p313_091|It's a very, very special day.
p313/p313_278|Something was plainly wrong.
p313/p313_194|That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
p313/p313_027|This year it will be Billy Crystal.
p313/p313_207|There are moments of honesty, too.
p313/p313_301|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
p313/p313_106|However, he added there were signs of progress.
p313/p313_350|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
p313/p313_045|I never had a childhood.
p313/p313_204|Election results are expected soon.
p313/p313_061|The firm was down and almost out.
p313/p313_131|I'd love to be at the World Cup.
p313/p313_183|I didn't want to ignore the punters.
p313/p313_346|My heart is not so sure.
p313/p313_243|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p313/p313_219|He's very, very lucky to be alive.
p313/p313_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p313/p313_150|Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
p313/p313_325|Players are fighting to stay in the team.
p313/p313_269|The conference is the first test.
p313/p313_060|It is not a standing army.
p313/p313_270|That's what we're trying to achieve.
p313/p313_123|There is a great carry over value.
p313/p313_151|Surely it can do better than that?
p313/p313_173|The stadium was full.
p313/p313_201|I'm just looking to take my chances.
p313/p313_369|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
p313/p313_103|Although, you never know.
p313/p313_110|I took the gun.
p313/p313_029|However, it's good to turn the page.
p313/p313_263|It's up to Ann.
p313/p313_223|We remain committed to it, as does the government.
p313/p313_089|This gives us a lot of practice.
p313/p313_247|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p313/p313_309|I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
p313/p313_163|It was a fiery game.
p313/p313_205|So she told him.
p313/p313_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p313/p313_102|There was no trouble at all.
p313/p313_149|It will be about commitment, not compliance.
p313/p313_221|It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
p313/p313_001|Please call Stella.
p313/p313_249|We should be rewarded for producing.
p313/p313_051|Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
p313/p313_282|I'm confident we can do that.
p313/p313_101|This is my personal assessment.
p313/p313_162|The General Election is all to play for.
p313/p313_135|I mean it happens.
p313/p313_328|It went on to become an annual event.
p313/p313_339|I can't believe the buzz.
p313/p313_359|The hotel was huge.
p313/p313_340|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
p313/p313_041|But he is not using them.
p313/p313_137|This performance has given my confidence a boost.
p313/p313_378|That's the only thing that matters.
p313/p313_253|It is a memorial.
p313/p313_381|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
p313/p313_414|We never agreed to it.
p313/p313_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p313/p313_420|Who can tell?
p313/p313_090|The Parliament will make its own decisions.
p313/p313_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p313/p313_036|The waiting is over, well almost.
p313/p313_306|It may well have been.
p313/p313_039|It helped me to get noticed.
p313/p313_411|The next eight weeks are critical to us.
p313/p313_105|The quality of work is very impressive.
p313/p313_343|It's no less intriguing, however.
p313/p313_327|Medical staff are with them at the moment.
p313/p313_318|That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
p313/p313_081|Who wants to be a millionaire?
p313/p313_215|Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
p313/p313_178|Any error is severely punished.
p313/p313_293|This year, it was a little different.
p313/p313_164|Agents and coaches must be paid.
p313/p313_196|After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
p313/p313_111|It's just one of those things.
p313/p313_093|There's also the point.
p313/p313_363|This is an internal matter.
p313/p313_273|There is no more money.
p313/p313_043|We are not moving in.
p313/p313_185|The United Nations must act.
p313/p313_299|The incident is being taken seriously.
p313/p313_171|The ministers are now to make their decision.
p313/p313_122|It's a way of making a mark.
p313/p313_240|Life was like a timetable.
p313/p313_264|We are playing them at their own game.
p313/p313_212|But there's no eye contact.
p313/p313_127|Why is this?
p313/p313_158|Who was on the panel?
p313/p313_080|Did they give any good advice?
p313/p313_398|He says it often enough.
p313/p313_084|That's why the ministers resigned.
p313/p313_108|I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
p313/p313_220|Some of the players have not progressed.
p313/p313_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p313/p313_026|It is never an easy game.
p313/p313_139|Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
p313/p313_277|It's an absolute disgrace.
p313/p313_334|She has nothing to say to journalists.
p313/p313_130|We need to make more inquiries about that.
p313/p313_086|This process of attrition is expected to continue.
p313/p313_134|At some point, the bill will be presented.
p313/p313_345|Staff have been informed.
p313/p313_297|What's the point of staying sober?
p313/p313_037|This was the performance, and the result they needed.
p313/p313_323|As if they ever stopped.
p313/p313_410|I knew people on that committee.
p313/p313_064|I learned a lot from that.
p313/p313_107|Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
p313/p313_079|They must be kept on the ground.
p313/p313_182|From now on there is no hiding place.
p313/p313_390|I may think about performing it.
p313/p313_179|He's got a great chance of making it.
p313/p313_391|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p313/p313_159|They may differ on other issues.
p313/p313_085|He has lost confidence and weight.
p313/p313_238|There is nothing to fear.
p313/p313_066|He got his degree.
p313/p313_225|This was not an easy meeting for me.
p313/p313_055|Her role in it was small.
p313/p313_038|I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
p313/p313_114|I was very fortunate.
p313/p313_095|Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
p313/p313_287|The end result is precisely the same.
p313/p313_320|Then came the crunch.
p313/p313_160|He'd never run the distance before.
p313/p313_099|He wouldn't allow that to happen.
p313/p313_059|It's back to how it used to be.
p313/p313_298|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
p313/p313_155|I, like an idiot, agreed.
p313/p313_188|His manager blamed the referee.
p313/p313_296|Is being naturally funny enough?
p313/p313_030|We have to put this behind us.
p313/p313_031|I thought it was quite good.
p313/p313_382|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
p313/p313_388|I was released after six days.
p313/p313_413|Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
p313/p313_405|The Open champion is back.
p313/p313_112|A web site is planned for November.
p313/p313_133|I'm sorry to hear this news.
p313/p313_113|We played so well at times.
p313/p313_230|She asked us a lot of questions.
p313/p313_319|Why is that?
p313/p313_326|For a few years we had good fun.
p313/p313_174|Dewar is the medium.
p313/p313_357|It seems very odd.
p313/p313_254|We feel it sends out the wrong message.
p313/p313_239|I was an athlete.
p313/p313_355|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
p313/p313_070|I'm confident of the outcome this week.
p313/p313_195|They believed it worked.
p313/p313_050|My brother's buried under there.
p313/p313_341|The picture is the same across Scotland.
p313/p313_147|We haven't found out anything different.
p313/p313_083|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p313/p313_072|Before the games it was pretty open.
p313/p313_418|Would they work together again?
p313/p313_250|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p313/p313_148|A review of the decision is being sought.
p313/p313_241|World leaders expressed their sympathy.
p313/p313_364|I'm amazed at what he's done.
p313/p313_276|There have been different reports from different people.
p313/p313_256|The reason is partly because of tradition.
p313/p313_304|I'm not a fan of books.
p313/p313_042|That, though, was just the start of it.
p313/p313_209|The night is young.
p313/p313_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p313/p313_191|We have understood the problems for some time.
p313/p313_075|I'm so worried about the roads.
p313/p313_377|She's currently in foster care.
p313/p313_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p313/p313_073|It really has left the town in shock.
p313/p313_267|So, it took me back to boarding school.
p313/p313_189|They were that poor.
p313/p313_244|This was done by the council staff.
p313/p313_353|He was made redundant in February of last year.
p313/p313_157|I'm not blaming audiences.
p313/p313_260|I read it every year.
p313/p313_096|That's the National Grid.
p313/p313_379|I enjoy the creative process.
p313/p313_407|As, indeed, they would be.
p313/p313_294|That, though, is to miss the point.
p313/p313_356|You've obviously got an answer to it.
p313/p313_288|We have it on video.
p313/p313_308|It was a simple question.
p313/p313_352|Two others were also seriously injured.
p313/p313_199|So they will settle again.
p313/p313_415|But that night they killed her housekeeper.
p313/p313_141|That sort of thing is long gone.
p313/p313_161|I can make one further announcement.
p313/p313_237|We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
p313/p313_373|Frank Warren is a great man.
p313/p313_360|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
p313/p313_423|The whole nation will be delighted.
p313/p313_422|Now, that is a good deal.
p313/p313_058|In a way he was.
p313/p313_280|One thing is sure.
p313/p313_262|Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
p313/p313_416|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
p313/p313_272|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
p313/p313_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p313/p313_385|We could learn a lot from them.
p313/p313_166|Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
p313/p313_329|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
p313/p313_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p313/p313_040|They hit me in the head.
p313/p313_371|I see it as my job.
p313/p313_125|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p313/p313_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p313/p313_168|This one is a special case.
p313/p313_046|Its effect on humans is not yet known.
p313/p313_333|But when we do it is great.
p313/p313_088|This could be her way forward.
p313/p313_313|Some of their movement was excellent.
p313/p313_314|But they had to be paid for.
p313/p313_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p313/p313_190|Patients will be partners in decision making.
p313/p313_047|We offered something different.
p313/p313_303|I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
p313/p313_401|I found that much more challenging.
p313/p313_176|It is very much a matter for them.
p313/p313_375|That was never their agenda.
p313/p313_177|Perhaps it is jealousy.
p313/p313_396|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
p313/p313_170|There is a simmering anger out there.
p313/p313_076|This was much worse.
p313/p313_071|There were no formal announcements.
p313/p313_245|The truth is otherwise.
p313/p313_342|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
p313/p313_197|They should feel ashamed.
p313/p313_180|We won't do that.
p313/p313_322|But will they fall in love?
p313/p313_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p313/p313_251|Which, in effect, it is.
p313/p313_348|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
p313/p313_034|That is impressive by any standards.
p313/p313_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p313/p313_417|Sightings were replaced by rumours.
p313/p313_275|The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
p313/p313_063|I was chosen to do this.
p313/p313_129|Raymond was always on the outside.
p313/p313_412|Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
p313/p313_187|Her daughter is getting married.
p313/p313_281|It was a foolhardy decision.
p313/p313_259|Perhaps we should do the same.
p313/p313_310|And we've beaten them before.
p313/p313_200|How do we get more people in?
p313/p313_374|I'm a little bit tired.
p313/p313_257|Nor is it likely to do so.
p313/p313_077|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p313/p313_302|I can feel the sound inside.
p313/p313_349|It's been handled entirely properly.
p313/p313_203|This is not a European Army.
p313/p313_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
p313/p313_172|That is not a position they enjoy.
p313/p313_119|O Neill is reputed to have replied.
p313/p313_078|We are confident of taking that back.
p313/p313_062|They said they were only young men.
p313/p313_271|I expect a rapid response.
p313/p313_104|We shall be victorious.
p313/p313_402|This fight is not going to go away.
p313/p313_228|And then a funny thing happened.
p313/p313_358|Closure is not one of them.
p313/p313_082|This does not help.
p313/p313_372|This was not a summit about the euro.
p313/p313_154|The salary changes are long overdue.
p313/p313_208|It was good to score the goal today.
p313/p313_184|He quit in October.
p313/p313_232|It is a technique.
p313/p313_284|It's funny how it comes and goes.
p313/p313_246|We haven't come out of this very well.
p313/p313_292|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
p313/p313_332|Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
p313/p313_116|We act because we must.
p313/p313_138|Receiving this medal is an honour.
p313/p313_198|This is a really serious issue.
p313/p313_033|This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
p313/p313_383|It's always the same, isn't it?
p313/p313_044|We have not had a formal request.
p313/p313_231|It was a stunning strike.
p313/p313_136|This week is a perfect example.
p313/p313_279|Why should he go anywhere?
p313/p313_094|It was forced to divert.
p313/p313_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p313/p313_167|It will not be easy for him.
p313/p313_145|However, it's not all bad news for women.
p313/p313_387|Sure, we have problems.
p313/p313_366|The idea was presented to me.
p313/p313_351|That might help a bit.
p313/p313_143|However, consumers may take a different view.
p263/p263_111|It has been a nightmare of frustration.
p263/p263_414|Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
p263/p263_416|I'm pleased about one thing.
p263/p263_289|He was also married with two children.
p263/p263_424|We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
p263/p263_213|He should emerge as the winner.
p263/p263_216|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p263/p263_201|It is a terrible loss.
p263/p263_360|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p263/p263_251|Do I think about them often?
p263/p263_186|Time is now very short.
p263/p263_434|It is not a standing army.
p263/p263_454|Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
p263/p263_389|This season has been a nightmare.
p263/p263_310|However, a ruling will not come before next week.
p263/p263_069|It is the only way forward for the club.
p263/p263_072|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p263/p263_384|It was like a weekly wage.
p263/p263_318|Nothing has been put into action.
p263/p263_409|The casualties were not named.
p263/p263_155|Check that he is dead.
p263/p263_370|The value of the merger is still there.
p263/p263_122|The problem was a social problem.
p263/p263_131|You can spend money on housing.
p263/p263_061|We have to keep our clients.
p263/p263_181|The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
p263/p263_312|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p263/p263_438|I can't wait for the season to end.
p263/p263_374|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p263/p263_456|They offer a kind of narrative.
p263/p263_156|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p263/p263_415|It was important to win the singles.
p263/p263_418|I had a tie in my hand.
p263/p263_053|He will need that machine.
p263/p263_187|Our position remains the same.
p263/p263_159|Like the others, he was arrested.
p263/p263_354|How do you take them away?
p263/p263_192|It makes no influence on the public.
p263/p263_410|We shall not be moved.
p263/p263_346|In the old days, it was easy.
p263/p263_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p263/p263_194|Says the Duke of York.
p263/p263_284|I was delighted with the way he jumped.
p263/p263_430|Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
p263/p263_267|The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
p263/p263_466|They're just a good retailer.
p263/p263_378|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p263/p263_171|Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
p263/p263_248|We were a load of rubbish.
p263/p263_306|What are they for?
p263/p263_129|It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
p263/p263_121|Pupils will be the losers.
p263/p263_168|The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
p263/p263_075|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p263/p263_325|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p263/p263_403|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p263/p263_319|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p263/p263_356|After the match, do you?
p263/p263_252|Is it in the right place?
p263/p263_081|Are you from the rugby?
p263/p263_327|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
p263/p263_030|We would like to find another region to develop in England.
p263/p263_209|However, this idea is never developed.
p263/p263_204|Or was it?
p263/p263_343|It's difficult to predict the future.
p263/p263_228|We can hardly talk about it.
p263/p263_381|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p263/p263_260|It might be sad, but it's a fact.
p263/p263_157|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p263/p263_183|Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
p263/p263_045|It seemed the tough times were behind him.
p263/p263_422|The Queen Mother is dead.
p263/p263_127|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p263/p263_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p263/p263_401|He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
p263/p263_071|It's all I can do.
p263/p263_435|We know about the crisis in cattle.
p263/p263_391|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p263/p263_001|Please call Stella.
p263/p263_146|Any success would have been an improvement.
p263/p263_326|The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
p263/p263_379|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p263/p263_448|It is not over by any means.
p263/p263_309|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p263/p263_417|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p263/p263_245|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p263/p263_472|It's just a place to open it.
p263/p263_083|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p263/p263_153|But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
p263/p263_407|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p263/p263_135|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p263/p263_286|You get a lot for your money.
p263/p263_337|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p263/p263_460|It has been a waste of time.
p263/p263_150|Next time round, it will be different.
p263/p263_179|So was the first half.
p263/p263_421|Today, the story is different.
p263/p263_123|Such actions are rarely popular.
p263/p263_420|Such an attack is bizarre.
p263/p263_332|It is a court case.
p263/p263_427|But we are severely limited in funds.
p263/p263_323|We're not an employment agency.
p263/p263_296|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p263/p263_291|I was first in the door.
p263/p263_302|I have lost all confidence.
p263/p263_199|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p263/p263_447|I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
p263/p263_275|I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
p263/p263_395|I was just happy to get my own goal.
p263/p263_254|Does that put pressure on us?
p263/p263_080|And does it?
p263/p263_090|Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
p263/p263_152|We have seen a copy of the report.
p263/p263_465|It was another reminder of the power of an image.
p263/p263_178|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p263/p263_136|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p263/p263_138|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p263/p263_225|Bombing is the easy option.
p263/p263_261|You look like a rugby player.
p263/p263_440|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p263/p263_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p263/p263_431|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p263/p263_308|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p263/p263_089|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p263/p263_451|It is a tough game but we have a chance.
p263/p263_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p263/p263_126|When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
p263/p263_137|It is just a tax on employment.
p263/p263_262|Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
p263/p263_471|That should get their attention.
p263/p263_117|He was jailed for a year.
p263/p263_442|There is The Beautiful Game to write.
p263/p263_299|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p263/p263_247|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p263/p263_229|It was located on the remote control.
p263/p263_339|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p263/p263_437|We shall not forget him.
p263/p263_118|It was won on the issue of the land.
p263/p263_095|It might change your life.
p263/p263_317|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p263/p263_086|Thomson is expected to manage the business.
p263/p263_393|She has a little boy.
p263/p263_335|He will go a long way.
p263/p263_036|Life was like a timetable.
p263/p263_052|He looks like an Afghan.
p263/p263_154|It is the quality of the work that counts.
p263/p263_051|I would love to have him home.
p263/p263_463|To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
p263/p263_278|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p263/p263_212|It is hard to tell.
p263/p263_119|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p263/p263_388|You have to rely on each other.
p263/p263_049|I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
p263/p263_158|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p263/p263_377|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p263/p263_235|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p263/p263_371|Nobody else was with me.
p263/p263_398|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p263/p263_338|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p263/p263_352|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p263/p263_098|You might not make it.
p263/p263_085|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p263/p263_054|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p263/p263_380|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p263/p263_218|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p263/p263_112|That all hope is never lost.
p263/p263_198|You know the sort of thing.
p263/p263_462|I saw it didn't work.
p263/p263_386|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p263/p263_130|It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
p263/p263_280|They must play for each other.
p263/p263_382|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p263/p263_099|Officers recovered a second body in the area.
p263/p263_243|The body follows the mind.
p263/p263_206|Two years later, she was dead.
p263/p263_363|The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
p263/p263_368|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p263/p263_288|He has not created a Festival resource.
p263/p263_197|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p263/p263_281|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p263/p263_270|We were not allowed to go to help them.
p263/p263_172|These days are long gone.
p263/p263_066|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p263/p263_223|A deadline is still essential.
p263/p263_330|We have a good healthy debate.
p263/p263_076|Even the one she loved.
p263/p263_140|Why change it?
p263/p263_249|He has run a hell of a race.
p263/p263_108|Our preference is to play in midweek.
p263/p263_449|The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
p263/p263_056|We have not given up hope.
p263/p263_331|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p263/p263_060|Four other charges were dropped.
p263/p263_340|She is on a life support machine.
p263/p263_210|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p263/p263_147|Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
p263/p263_256|The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
p263/p263_230|It is safe in our hands.
p263/p263_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p263/p263_038|You have to expect this type of thing.
p263/p263_073|It was nice to get a clean sheet.
p263/p263_266|We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
p263/p263_231|I'm just a regular person.
p263/p263_196|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p263/p263_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p263/p263_191|The championship is different from the other majors.
p263/p263_161|I have had a good life.
p263/p263_285|Much of the equipment was new.
p263/p263_439|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p263/p263_320|Like many companies, it is a problem.
p263/p263_032|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p263/p263_170|Neither side can win this war.
p263/p263_361|He was then replaced by Ross.
p263/p263_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p263/p263_110|In the end we made too many errors.
p263/p263_097|Mr Blair should be warned.
p263/p263_193|I thought he did very well.
p263/p263_222|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
p263/p263_350|Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
p263/p263_376|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p263/p263_217|The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
p263/p263_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p263/p263_102|I did not have a bet on myself.
p263/p263_269|It should have taken a year for a company this size.
p263/p263_167|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p263/p263_444|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p263/p263_385|Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
p263/p263_106|There is a contract in existence for Allan.
p263/p263_065|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p263/p263_324|I could not have hoped to run at this level.
p263/p263_294|It will always be the highlight of my career.
p263/p263_405|MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
p263/p263_226|He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
p263/p263_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p263/p263_241|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p263/p263_203|Who was she?
p263/p263_433|Which may be the same thing.
p263/p263_237|That you can do it.
p263/p263_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p263/p263_282|It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
p263/p263_077|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p263/p263_345|Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
p263/p263_457|He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
p263/p263_188|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p263/p263_208|It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
p263/p263_455|However, one has arrived in the post.
p263/p263_273|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p263/p263_214|I came home by ambulance.
p263/p263_227|Abbey National is an option.
p263/p263_316|But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
p263/p263_342|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p263/p263_300|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p263/p263_219|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p263/p263_313|I have decided to stand down from the list.
p263/p263_333|The minister is the engineer.
p263/p263_321|Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
p263/p263_259|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p263/p263_279|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p263/p263_272|It seems a shame to leave it.
p263/p263_425|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p263/p263_468|It's been a long, long journey.
p263/p263_341|He is married with three children.
p263/p263_349|It is the same old story.
p263/p263_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p263/p263_025|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p263/p263_215|This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
p263/p263_255|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p263/p263_450|He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p263/p263_305|Are they free?
p263/p263_148|I never wanted a legal battle.
p263/p263_160|She will do for me.
p263/p263_445|No, because it was too many.
p263/p263_046|That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
p263/p263_293|Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
p263/p263_348|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p263/p263_375|And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
p263/p263_411|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p263/p263_383|The bank was now involved.
p263/p263_429|It is that sort of film.
p263/p263_087|The damage from the fire was huge.
p263/p263_182|It's nice to be involved.
p263/p263_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p263/p263_104|A progress report will be published in October.
p263/p263_031|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p263/p263_351|Overall, we are very pleased.
p263/p263_068|Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
p263/p263_116|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p263/p263_353|Does it matter?
p263/p263_211|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p263/p263_055|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p263/p263_396|He later became a respected High Court judge.
p263/p263_253|Did he trip?
p263/p263_114|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p263/p263_441|You have got to be careful.
p263/p263_265|You can feel at home in China.
p263/p263_125|It isn't a happy memory.
p263/p263_246|That will be the criteria for the future.
p263/p263_185|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p263/p263_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p263/p263_050|People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
p263/p263_400|They have put in a lot of time and effort.
p263/p263_446|He deserves a second chance.
p263/p263_257|The irony was not lost.
p263/p263_173|It is an attitude of mind.
p263/p263_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p263/p263_040|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p263/p263_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p263/p263_404|He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
p263/p263_297|She failed in her action.
p263/p263_220|They are in the euro.
p263/p263_174|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p263/p263_461|The rest of the business is very robust.
p263/p263_105|The investment will be in the food.
p263/p263_169|I would like to see the figures  for the second quarter.
p263/p263_029|What do we do?
p263/p263_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p263/p263_390|I felt the head was very like me.
p263/p263_303|John was there already in spirit.
p263/p263_103|I saw the whole thing.
p263/p263_276|That could be in place by next year.
p263/p263_233|In each case they were a goal down.
p263/p263_064|I am pleased to be in them.
p263/p263_287|An announcement will follow in due course.
p263/p263_128|They've got to account for it.
p263/p263_202|I think, therefore I am?
p263/p263_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p263/p263_058|I've got to provide for my family.
p263/p263_142|Does the name matter?
p263/p263_242|She will attend in July.
p263/p263_366|But we welcome this document.
p263/p263_298|Its body language is all wrong.
p263/p263_470|There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
p263/p263_473|My place is in the kitchen.
p263/p263_034|The idea is not new.
p263/p263_084|The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
p263/p263_133|They have to come clean.
p263/p263_244|I always felt that I was in control of the match.
p263/p263_092|The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
p263/p263_151|She died at her home.
p263/p263_096|No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
p263/p263_180|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p263/p263_177|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p263/p263_314|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p263/p263_026|How are you, sir?
p263/p263_176|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
p263/p263_044|It will come all right.
p263/p263_232|I am considered a teenager.
p263/p263_027|So is that it, then?
p263/p263_047|The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
p263/p263_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p263/p263_149|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p263/p263_394|Theatre is not a museum.
p263/p263_039|No company would want to put their people at risk.
p263/p263_190|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p263/p263_134|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p263/p263_063|Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
p263/p263_258|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p263/p263_189|The region is open for business.
p263/p263_304|In the end, it was no choice.
p263/p263_139|The squad is too small.
p263/p263_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p263/p263_145|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p263/p263_357|The pain was almost too much to bear.
p263/p263_264|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p263/p263_334|There is no plan B.
p263/p263_028|Do I have a favourite?
p263/p263_043|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p263/p263_239|It could be to do with the location.
p263/p263_392|We have to put pressure on Rangers.
p263/p263_328|They come to enjoy themselves.
p263/p263_093|The trick is to try it.
p263/p263_109|You are like an animal.
p263/p263_277|The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
p263/p263_238|We will reform the welfare state.
p263/p263_292|Access has been a nightmare.
p263/p263_367|He did a good job.
p263/p263_336|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p263/p263_163|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p263/p263_113|It should be a great game, though.
p263/p263_369|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p263/p263_428|Together, we can make a difference.
p263/p263_268|My son was too young to die.
p263/p263_162|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p263/p263_070|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p263/p263_365|There is a range of employers.
p263/p263_419|I can lead by example.
p263/p263_329|There's still a bit to go.
p263/p263_091|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
p263/p263_311|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p263/p263_453|It looked like a war zone.
p263/p263_399|Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
p263/p263_469|I just got under the ball a bit.
p263/p263_132|I told him I was a long time ago.
p263/p263_078|So, did she meet him?
p263/p263_408|It was an amazing afternoon.
p263/p263_426|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p263/p263_143|how do you get it back?
p263/p263_397|The thing is to recognise that chance.
p263/p263_165|However, she did not report the matter to the police.
p263/p263_062|Indeed, it is only the beginning.
p263/p263_035|I could not do it.
p263/p263_088|A play is a set of actions.
p263/p263_347|The airport was even different.
p263/p263_100|However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
p263/p263_301|So the Government will be damaged.
p263/p263_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p263/p263_200|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
p263/p263_458|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p263/p263_263|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p263/p263_344|My body is clearly capable.
p263/p263_274|I can't get a job.
p263/p263_250|What was the matter for concern?
p263/p263_124|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p263/p263_057|It will now take over the running of the estate.
p263/p263_224|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p263/p263_423|Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
p263/p263_082|Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
p263/p263_271|I didn't see the point.
p263/p263_107|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p263/p263_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p263/p263_234|It's just a normal life.
p263/p263_436|As it turned out it was a triumph.
p263/p263_074|It is a job creation scheme.
p263/p263_115|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p263/p263_467|Tickets will be at a premium.
p263/p263_406|We must improve our relations with government.
p263/p263_141|What do we want to do that for?
p263/p263_359|There is a good example in this city.
p263/p263_236|People should make their own decisions.
p263/p263_144|The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
p263/p263_315|They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
p263/p263_372|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p263/p263_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p263/p263_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p263/p263_283|They can leave at any time.
p263/p263_207|It is not easy to live in Russia.
p263/p263_094|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p263/p263_322|However, a bid was never made.
p263/p263_048|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p263/p263_175|Eight months later, he was dead.
p263/p263_443|No decisions have been made in this respect.
p263/p263_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p263/p263_164|It is crucial for both teams.
p263/p263_033|Allan Johnston was not match fit.
p263/p263_205|And they were being paid?
p263/p263_120|The fire was above the hole.
p263/p263_364|It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
p263/p263_387|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p263/p263_459|It goes with the job.
p263/p263_373|They may yet have the last laugh.
p263/p263_295|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p263/p263_355|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p263/p263_184|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p263/p263_101|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p263/p263_464|We are over the moon.
p263/p263_402|He replied that it was a dilemma.
p263/p263_362|That's as it should be.
p263/p263_413|The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
p263/p263_221|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p263/p263_412|It looked like a river.
p263/p263_195|The shooting created panic in the street.
p263/p263_079|So what is the campaign about?
p263/p263_358|Whether this return was too soon.
p263/p263_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p263/p263_166|Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
p263/p263_041|It could well be the case.
p263/p263_432|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p263/p263_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p263/p263_059|It was bound to happen.
p263/p263_042|This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
p263/p263_307|Is there a waiting list?
p264/p264_181|Neil has worked hard throughout his career.
p264/p264_387|Young people will always run away.
p264/p264_089|The savings can be dramatic.
p264/p264_301|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p264/p264_466|It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.
p264/p264_314|Hibs are playing with style now.
p264/p264_143|I told them during their morning break.
p264/p264_426|She had black eyes.
p264/p264_064|People come to see the Highlands.
p264/p264_112|This makes up for it.
p264/p264_032|He added that her comments were noted.
p264/p264_305|Only one got through.
p264/p264_174|Now he's back on top again.
p264/p264_094|What is the wife?
p264/p264_235|After the match, do you?
p264/p264_109|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
p264/p264_273|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p264/p264_091|They are a different team at home.
p264/p264_244|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p264/p264_057|Do I have a favourite?
p264/p264_117|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p264/p264_196|What do they want us to do?
p264/p264_253|He is keen to stay in public service.
p264/p264_054|All options are available.
p264/p264_079|Only water is currently allowed.
p264/p264_248|They were game, but not very good.
p264/p264_201|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p264/p264_119|Trading is tough at the moment.
p264/p264_319|Not one person spoke badly.
p264/p264_451|These days are past.
p264/p264_340|In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.
p264/p264_189|They were certainly tough, but totally fair.
p264/p264_411|They like big name players.
p264/p264_205|I saw people on fire.
p264/p264_249|I did not vote either way.
p264/p264_217|Now we have fresh hope.
p264/p264_300|That was around July, August.
p264/p264_332|Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
p264/p264_044|It does not stop here.
p264/p264_289|You have made your point.
p264/p264_149|Is it in the right place?
p264/p264_420|He is very fast all right.
p264/p264_369|That is for white people.
p264/p264_124|The family moved around a lot.
p264/p264_435|It all came good.
p264/p264_357|Neil knows the score.
p264/p264_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p264/p264_155|The second failed completely.
p264/p264_481|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p264/p264_336|This fact is supported by audience research.
p264/p264_427|In practice, the economic tests have to be met.
p264/p264_126|An announcement is expected within a few months.
p264/p264_382|If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.
p264/p264_234|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p264/p264_437|Special measures were needed.
p264/p264_164|The options seem limited.
p264/p264_069|This is far too high.
p264/p264_192|Is there a waiting list?
p264/p264_270|I knew him well.
p264/p264_262|They made such decisions in London.
p264/p264_092|However this weekend it will be different.
p264/p264_223|IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.
p264/p264_379|He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.
p264/p264_226|No partners would lose their jobs.
p264/p264_236|Has the conflict started?
p264/p264_198|Does it matter?
p264/p264_491|This operation will change her life.
p264/p264_068|That is not possible.
p264/p264_472|We showed some spirit against Newcastle.
p264/p264_140|He nearly killed my son.
p264/p264_477|The child has denied murder.
p264/p264_039|I wish I could see it again.
p264/p264_099|What are you not good at?
p264/p264_345|I believe they are dead.
p264/p264_364|They had to have hospital treatment.
p264/p264_294|If so, we want to hear from them.
p264/p264_251|I hit you there.
p264/p264_348|It looks at public interest issues.
p264/p264_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p264/p264_260|We had a grand view.
p264/p264_026|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p264/p264_224|It was all great training.
p264/p264_185|The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.
p264/p264_118|But I am in practice.
p264/p264_378|John gave up everything to be with me.
p264/p264_105|It would be easy to think so.
p264/p264_488|Just look at his fashion sense.
p264/p264_401|He plays only for himself.
p264/p264_327|They emerged before the patients left hospital.
p264/p264_122|That was a great performance by the team.
p264/p264_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p264/p264_035|This remains the case.
p264/p264_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p264/p264_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p264/p264_173|Art can challenge our value system.
p264/p264_097|Does the name matter?
p264/p264_043|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p264/p264_465|He enjoyed being with his family.
p264/p264_218|Life is still very tough for them.
p264/p264_284|It's not a small step.
p264/p264_087|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p264/p264_350|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
p264/p264_161|No such meeting took place.
p264/p264_077|The time has arrived for a review.
p264/p264_295|She doesn't know the half of it.
p264/p264_272|All films open tomorrow
p264/p264_312|They might surprise themselves.
p264/p264_208|Her experience is certainly limited.
p264/p264_060|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p264/p264_419|We didn't really have to power up.
p264/p264_050|The Office is a show about nothing, then.
p264/p264_310|He left pretty quickly.
p264/p264_277|People realise we have a job to do.
p264/p264_163|There is no doubt there's room for us.
p264/p264_402|They have quick front players, but so do we.
p264/p264_061|So, did she meet him?
p264/p264_460|We have very limited capacity.
p264/p264_182|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p264/p264_166|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p264/p264_038|It was a total surprise.
p264/p264_425|Those overseas offices were great.
p264/p264_082|It looks that way.
p264/p264_025|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p264/p264_296|Perhaps they were right.
p264/p264_183|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p264/p264_483|Your bank may offer you a choice of options.
p264/p264_453|They finished second and third.
p264/p264_158|We have come a long way since then.
p264/p264_395|We learned two things.
p264/p264_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p264/p264_048|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
p264/p264_410|But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.
p264/p264_292|It's just an area of water.
p264/p264_418|The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.
p264/p264_179|You can spend money on housing.
p264/p264_287|He followed the Italian route.
p264/p264_151|Does that put pressure on us?
p264/p264_423|This man must be helped to keep his arm.
p264/p264_214|Three hit the target.
p264/p264_361|It shows we're not much of a rugby country.
p264/p264_114|But they had to be paid for.
p264/p264_330|I can't get away from it.
p264/p264_100|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
p264/p264_409|You took the law into your own hands.
p264/p264_129|These people were my friends.
p264/p264_102|I feel confident about the outcome.
p264/p264_191|We tried four banks.
p264/p264_206|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p264/p264_156|It gives a commitment.
p264/p264_209|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p264/p264_204|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p264/p264_456|It had been accepted.
p264/p264_062|It happens from time to time.
p264/p264_479|We were given a break.
p264/p264_317|Other teams moved up too.
p264/p264_288|If not, a deal could take many months.
p264/p264_227|I was in daily contact.
p264/p264_462|They're interested only in profits.
p264/p264_034|We are opening an inquiry.
p264/p264_242|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p264/p264_162|It is just too tough.
p264/p264_283|She now lives in London.
p264/p264_250|We really are a team.
p264/p264_347|We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.
p264/p264_150|Did he trip?
p264/p264_440|That approach has passed its sell by date.
p264/p264_088|They're already booked for next year.
p264/p264_178|We just want this session to end.
p264/p264_216|Henry should go now.
p264/p264_282|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p264/p264_487|Her father wasn't best pleased.
p264/p264_320|The performance continues to improve.
p264/p264_128|Eight others have followed.
p264/p264_480|The first four teams were all inside the previous record.
p264/p264_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p264/p264_400|The tickets are on their way.
p264/p264_207|Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.
p264/p264_461|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p264/p264_397|It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.
p264/p264_142|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p264/p264_413|Williams said the same.
p264/p264_243|Eight months later, he was dead.
p264/p264_486|The accident seemed so simple.
p264/p264_134|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p264/p264_197|Is it worth it?
p264/p264_386|They want the style of the sound changed a bit.
p264/p264_074|I think with my experience I can help the team.
p264/p264_065|It is nice to be a woman and a wife.
p264/p264_367|It has helped focus attention on junior golf.
p264/p264_482|I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.
p264/p264_086|Because I was a very physical person.
p264/p264_176|No-one wants to talk about death.
p264/p264_370|Neither had any other career.
p264/p264_085|We're at home, which is important.
p264/p264_306|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p264/p264_429|The people are nice, though.
p264/p264_328|He did not say that.
p264/p264_381|People could have a post box in the local post office.
p264/p264_467|This is a big advantage.
p264/p264_298|Many events are down on numbers.
p264/p264_211|He was a home referee.
p264/p264_193|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p264/p264_027|He does not even trust his own members.
p264/p264_341|This deal is a great boost for the Borders.
p264/p264_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p264/p264_186|She runs like her mother.
p264/p264_104|Jack was always going to win this one.
p264/p264_157|Now it was Britain's turn.
p264/p264_096|What do we want to do that for?
p264/p264_030|Do not give your details to anyone.
p264/p264_325|They should try to get tickets.
p264/p264_495|This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.
p264/p264_458|The technology looks excellent.
p264/p264_231|This is absolutely not true.
p264/p264_070|He has real potential.
p264/p264_042|It is a complex deal.
p264/p264_414|I was the sheep.
p264/p264_125|We beat the Welsh team.
p264/p264_494|That means a ban on French products.
p264/p264_366|Five local people were injured.
p264/p264_365|I would never even consider it.
p264/p264_073|Confidence is as low as it can get.
p264/p264_110|You can maintain regular contact.
p264/p264_326|The change could come as soon as September.
p264/p264_080|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p264/p264_076|The deal was done on Wednesday.
p264/p264_081|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p264/p264_146|Mr Dewar understood that.
p264/p264_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p264/p264_334|I saw one man vote five times.
p264/p264_355|Her father had died recently.
p264/p264_256|We have brought the staff back on board.
p264/p264_267|I was totally wrong.
p264/p264_385|His third child was born in April.
p264/p264_090|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p264/p264_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p264/p264_258|The group's increasing scale will help.
p264/p264_147|She's been shot.
p264/p264_046|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p264/p264_439|Colin Cameron was excellent.
p264/p264_343|The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
p264/p264_113|Firm action must be taken.
p264/p264_276|Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.
p264/p264_363|The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.
p264/p264_056|So is that it, then?
p264/p264_238|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p264/p264_265|Some changes have been achieved at great cost.
p264/p264_083|Now comes the hard part.
p264/p264_431|We cannot ask for them back.
p264/p264_200|At half-time he was presented to both teams.
p264/p264_180|I've never had a year like this.
p264/p264_299|He had served his time.
p264/p264_464|Scotland needs this award.
p264/p264_323|Someone should tell them.
p264/p264_078|That is very important.
p264/p264_168|Everything people said about it was true.
p264/p264_033|It felt right for me.
p264/p264_245|I go home only once.
p264/p264_383|This is too much like Scotland.
p264/p264_285|They have the cash and the fire power.
p264/p264_459|The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.
p264/p264_407|So I moved on.
p264/p264_335|It's quite crucial for me.
p264/p264_304|I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.
p264/p264_047|The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.
p264/p264_421|They could change them tomorrow.
p264/p264_127|We have a team to reach the final.
p264/p264_160|It was clearly not a battle.
p264/p264_452|The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.
p264/p264_478|The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.
p264/p264_159|Sport is good for you.
p264/p264_422|We have some options there.
p264/p264_195|Had this been common practice?
p264/p264_233|It was a great evening.
p264/p264_131|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
p264/p264_278|I'm interested in interesting work.
p264/p264_271|I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
p264/p264_351|He is fully fit.
p264/p264_237|Have I really come to this?
p264/p264_309|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p264/p264_490|We've got good options.
p264/p264_302|It changed the very language.
p264/p264_354|Both watched her win yesterday.
p264/p264_190|The questions came quick and fast.
p264/p264_139|He said some things which were better left alone.
p264/p264_132|This commitment should be built upon.
p264/p264_436|It was a hard fight.
p264/p264_390|It is the same with Barry.
p264/p264_252|The pension levels will remain the same.
p264/p264_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p264/p264_269|Others get through it.
p264/p264_396|It has been only average.
p264/p264_359|It had been introduced over six years.
p264/p264_036|Certainly, we do as well.
p264/p264_172|I'm taking each day as it comes.
p264/p264_202|I was independent but I am not now.
p264/p264_454|He was then replaced by Ross.
p264/p264_154|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p264/p264_116|Nothing would now surprise me.
p264/p264_403|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p264/p264_362|Her body has never been found.
p264/p264_408|That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.
p264/p264_376|He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.
p264/p264_029|The local primary is excellent.
p264/p264_115|That's the bit that's wrong.
p264/p264_377|It would have to look for outside funding.
p264/p264_406|The songs are just so good.
p264/p264_121|All music goes into me.
p264/p264_415|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.
p264/p264_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p264/p264_428|I have to protect them.
p264/p264_212|Brian was last to join.
p264/p264_093|Are you going to win?
p264/p264_321|We want immediate action.
p264/p264_344|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p264/p264_450|We are unable to provide support for future issues.
p264/p264_257|We had a right to expect those days were over.
p264/p264_398|It was an attitude thing.
p264/p264_075|That is really all.
p264/p264_120|It came a bit late.
p264/p264_210|He suffered severe head injuries.
p264/p264_169|I've no idea how it works.
p264/p264_393|No, because they look good boys.
p264/p264_322|Our relationship has been very good.
p264/p264_484|That is surely worth a try.
p264/p264_194|So what happens next?
p264/p264_485|I believe in theatre.
p264/p264_329|We are a husband and wife team.
p264/p264_281|He will get his chances.
p264/p264_442|WE all watch the same match.
p264/p264_468|He dismissed the action.
p264/p264_438|However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.
p264/p264_339|Time remains to put other candidates forward.
p264/p264_130|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p264/p264_084|Maybe they will see sense.
p264/p264_184|She really suffered for her art.
p264/p264_446|The three previous winners also came from Scotland.
p264/p264_286|The institute board will take the decision.
p264/p264_199|How do you take them away?
p264/p264_493|He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.
p264/p264_187|I remember that day well.
p264/p264_389|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p264/p264_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p264/p264_489|That time may never be broken.
p264/p264_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p264/p264_101|Two of our crew were killed.
p264/p264_416|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p264/p264_391|The experts got it wrong.
p264/p264_213|It was men against boys.
p264/p264_137|This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.
p264/p264_230|Many changes are positive changes.
p264/p264_313|It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.
p264/p264_333|That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
p264/p264_447|In the old days, it was easy.
p264/p264_259|We were looking for a base.
p264/p264_219|It was a piece of art.
p264/p264_375|We have a high quality product.
p264/p264_254|For that reason cover should not be given.
p264/p264_316|This is extremely positive news.
p264/p264_028|We're only taking on a couple just now.
p264/p264_145|The truth will come out.
p264/p264_291|We must move on.
p264/p264_221|Britain will be little affected.
p264/p264_107|I was born for this moment.
p264/p264_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p264/p264_404|It was that kind of match.
p264/p264_037|It carried a double message.
p264/p264_144|The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
p264/p264_045|We're working on it night and day.
p264/p264_228|He talks too much.
p264/p264_261|Walker declined to put a figure on losses.
p264/p264_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p264/p264_246|It is based on population rather than need.
p264/p264_399|But it is her picture.
p264/p264_280|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p264/p264_474|I've got to win here to be happy.
p264/p264_188|In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.
p264/p264_324|They really had a go at us.
p264/p264_352|That would concern me lot.
p264/p264_103|The referee had been right.
p264/p264_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p264/p264_049|I only signed this morning.
p264/p264_136|However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.
p264/p264_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p264/p264_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p264/p264_059|Why do it otherwise?
p264/p264_138|It's very dangerous for markets.
p264/p264_471|Each year they cut them down a bit.
p264/p264_040|I am secure in my owns position.
p264/p264_031|I feel I did not have enough time.
p264/p264_424|Our performance wasn't perfect.
p264/p264_373|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p264/p264_455|They thought he was asking the right questions.
p264/p264_476|Tell us about it.
p264/p264_153|Their moment had come, or so they said.
p264/p264_063|You could very well be.
p264/p264_232|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p264/p264_372|I took my chance.
p264/p264_356|We accept the new rules.
p264/p264_444|The company was set up six years ago.
p264/p264_148|Do I think about them often?
p264/p264_470|It is an industry failure.
p264/p264_417|A report will be issued by March.
p264/p264_152|Did it work?
p264/p264_492|New York is my home.
p264/p264_443|We would deal first with the biggest party.
p264/p264_449|The festival runs until Tuesday.
p264/p264_051|We were leading by two goals.
p264/p264_071|But I had never been in a theatre.
p264/p264_215|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p264/p264_279|It would be nice to be involved in another victory.
p264/p264_098|how do you get it back?
p264/p264_342|An opera company needs to have its orchestra.
p264/p264_445|It was an outstanding performance.
p264/p264_255|He felt too close to head office.
p264/p264_241|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p264/p264_141|That comes at a cost.
p264/p264_311|The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
p264/p264_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p264/p264_001|Please call Stella.
p264/p264_247|Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.
p264/p264_274|The third has yet to be named.
p264/p264_374|It was exactly four months away.
p264/p264_346|We have no information on Iraq.
p264/p264_441|Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.
p264/p264_203|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p264/p264_066|She always put the party first.
p264/p264_475|I'm delighted for Andy.
p264/p264_170|No, but my wife is.
p264/p264_353|It's clearly a budget.
p264/p264_433|He doesn't need to hit people.
p264/p264_463|That does not take much training.
p264/p264_171|It is a large number.
p264/p264_108|I first met him last summer.
p264/p264_308|There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
p264/p264_405|Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.
p264/p264_457|The truth was rather different.
p264/p264_434|A job is a job, after all.
p264/p264_167|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p264/p264_293|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.
p264/p264_360|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p264/p264_388|The view is impressive.
p264/p264_106|You're quite wrong, he said.
p264/p264_371|Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.
p264/p264_177|Once again, he refused.
p264/p264_469|If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.
p264/p264_058|What do we do?
p264/p264_123|It seemed like four hours.
p264/p264_275|He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.
p264/p264_318|I just felt like a dead loss.
p264/p264_315|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p264/p264_432|The tie isn't over.
p264/p264_055|How are you, sir?
p264/p264_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p264/p264_430|Equipment is also a problem.
p264/p264_358|He could still be President.
p264/p264_222|The two companies were not for sale.
p264/p264_337|The regional government faces key elections next May.
p264/p264_368|We've had some pretty bad times.
p264/p264_135|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
p264/p264_053|It was dangerous but vital employment.
p264/p264_297|Autumn will be a real challenge.
p264/p264_473|It's a tough old job to get for your first job.
p264/p264_240|This is a big game for both of us.
p264/p264_349|The book is closed.
p264/p264_268|I may play with two players up, maybe not.
p264/p264_263|The proposal was rejected.
p264/p264_380|I have been going through a lot of things.
p264/p264_392|We have done our own tests.
p264/p264_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p264/p264_412|Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.
p264/p264_133|I hope we've reached the bottom now.
p264/p264_264|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p264/p264_266|Everyone wanted him to win.
p264/p264_331|He had played very well.
p264/p264_067|Things have just worked out this way.
p264/p264_290|He died the following year.
p264/p264_307|It's not a marketing scheme.
p264/p264_303|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p264/p264_448|Powers looks straight ahead.
p264/p264_165|It's been my life.
p264/p264_072|Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.
p264/p264_394|His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.
p280/p280_162|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p280/p280_001|Please call Stella.
p280/p280_113|Is there a waiting list?
p280/p280_139|The programme has been made with great care.
p280/p280_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p280/p280_266|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p280/p280_167|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p280/p280_404|My views on the decision are well known.
p280/p280_033|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p280/p280_363|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p280/p280_260|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p280/p280_152|Did it work?
p280/p280_274|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p280/p280_112|What are they for?
p280/p280_046|How do you take them away?
p280/p280_286|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p280/p280_407|Some would say that that culture had been created already.
p280/p280_067|He was failed by his health authority.
p280/p280_136|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p280/p280_316|A report on their property is due within days.
p280/p280_203|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p280/p280_189|The story was not made public by this club.
p280/p280_390|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p280/p280_168|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p280/p280_121|They have no real friends in the region.
p280/p280_044|Is it worth it?
p280/p280_304|Had I heard?
p280/p280_178|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p280/p280_259|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p280/p280_096|Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p280/p280_308|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p280/p280_049|Has the conflict started?
p280/p280_215|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p280/p280_247|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p280/p280_069|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p280/p280_043|He too started on the subs seats.
p280/p280_161|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p280/p280_285|There was just fire all around me.
p280/p280_233|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p280/p280_409|The play was to go straight ahead.
p280/p280_222|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p280/p280_306|Are you going to win?
p280/p280_244|how do you get it back?
p280/p280_135|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p280/p280_084|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p280/p280_089|I feel I did not have enough time.
p280/p280_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p280/p280_147|You should feel involved in their lives.
p280/p280_354|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p280/p280_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p280/p280_155|Time may already have run out for this option.
p280/p280_312|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p280/p280_105|I bought a flat six years ago.
p280/p280_129|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p280/p280_398|People have a wish to charge twice.
p280/p280_395|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p280/p280_144|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p280/p280_386|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p280/p280_225|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p280/p280_068|But it was not all bad news.
p280/p280_192|I am fighting the force of nature.
p280/p280_408|So it looks like a done deal.
p280/p280_160|A progress report will be published in October.
p280/p280_361|The institute board will take the decision.
p280/p280_314|He felt too close to head office.
p280/p280_393|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p280/p280_329|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p280/p280_253|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p280/p280_056|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p280/p280_325|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p280/p280_230|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p280/p280_366|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p280/p280_289|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p280/p280_118|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p280/p280_231|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p280/p280_336|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p280/p280_074|But two groups refused to sign up.
p280/p280_280|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p280/p280_039|She will get through it I'm sure.
p280/p280_270|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p280/p280_335|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p280/p280_156|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p280/p280_262|There would be a north and south division.
p280/p280_378|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p280/p280_193|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p280/p280_396|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p280/p280_116|Had this been common practice?
p280/p280_052|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p280/p280_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p280/p280_263|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p280/p280_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p280/p280_352|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p280/p280_287|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p280/p280_195|And they were being paid?
p280/p280_158|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p280/p280_367|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p280/p280_347|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p280/p280_320|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p280/p280_339|So is that it, then?
p280/p280_078|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p280/p280_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p280/p280_353|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p280/p280_265|His condition was described as serious last night.
p280/p280_211|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p280/p280_350|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p280/p280_198|But they had to be paid for.
p280/p280_075|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p280/p280_173|If successful, several records will be made.
p280/p280_070|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p280/p280_326|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p280/p280_027|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p280/p280_356|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p280/p280_255|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p280/p280_099|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p280/p280_166|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p280/p280_257|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p280/p280_399|I think it's a big advantage to us.
p280/p280_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p280/p280_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p280/p280_117|What do they want us to do?
p280/p280_197|What was the matter for concern?
p280/p280_045|Does it matter?
p280/p280_164|Surely it can't run for two years.
p280/p280_034|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p280/p280_212|It is going to change the world.
p280/p280_175|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p280/p280_379|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p280/p280_032|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p280/p280_109|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p280/p280_401|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
p280/p280_047|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p280/p280_110|Some young girls also came by last night.
p280/p280_126|So I am going in the right direction.
p280/p280_369|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p280/p280_101|We are already seeing some positive results.
p280/p280_384|What do we do?
p280/p280_060|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p280/p280_358|His style was direct and very human.
p280/p280_334|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p280/p280_345|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p280/p280_190|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p280/p280_104|They won't actually make any money from it.
p280/p280_333|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p280/p280_331|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p280/p280_179|Nato has left them with no other option.
p280/p280_380|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p280/p280_392|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p280/p280_302|And does it?
p280/p280_281|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p280/p280_278|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p280/p280_090|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p280/p280_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p280/p280_097|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p280/p280_410|At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
p280/p280_299|He could understand both points of view.
p280/p280_040|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p280/p280_400|There were no hard words between us.
p280/p280_341|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p280/p280_332|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p280/p280_065|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p280/p280_275|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p280/p280_293|They first met during a Step in London.
p280/p280_382|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p280/p280_301|So what is the campaign about?
p280/p280_100|I am delighted to hear this news.
p280/p280_079|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p280/p280_261|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p280/p280_239|Jim was down there with his wife.
p280/p280_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p280/p280_199|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p280/p280_210|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p280/p280_394|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p280/p280_041|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p280/p280_140|There was only one living room, you see.
p280/p280_169|We had to work very hard for our points.
p280/p280_088|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p280/p280_071|It turned me against the whole system.
p280/p280_050|Have I really come to this?
p280/p280_224|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p280/p280_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p280/p280_080|They said our costs were too high.
p280/p280_322|We will not simply hit these people.
p280/p280_391|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p280/p280_357|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p280/p280_059|We just want this season to end.
p280/p280_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p280/p280_188|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p280/p280_083|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p280/p280_264|The two companies were not for sale.
p280/p280_328|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p280/p280_383|I just felt that I was broken down.
p280/p280_127|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p280/p280_337|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p280/p280_324|It is not either national standards or local control.
p280/p280_272|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p280/p280_362|He's young enough and he must learn.
p280/p280_330|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p280/p280_107|They are a different team at home.
p280/p280_119|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p280/p280_133|No country has a similar training programme.
p280/p280_108|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p280/p280_343|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p280/p280_124|In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
p280/p280_151|Does that put pressure on us?
p280/p280_194|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p280/p280_311|He is keen to stay in public service.
p280/p280_295|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p280/p280_355|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p280/p280_223|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p280/p280_234|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p280/p280_283|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p280/p280_368|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p280/p280_219|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p280/p280_063|There were no details of the other five victims.
p280/p280_381|This is not a small amount of money.
p280/p280_157|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p280/p280_256|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p280/p280_217|I do not see this so much as failure.
p280/p280_251|However, the figures tell a different story.
p280/p280_388|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p280/p280_309|It had happened on average once a week this year.
p280/p280_214|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p280/p280_319|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p280/p280_303|Are you from the rugby?
p280/p280_132|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p280/p280_130|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p280/p280_066|Do not give your details to anyone.
p280/p280_064|It also has a good labour supply.
p280/p280_291|He would get into any world team.
p280/p280_297|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p280/p280_305|What happened in that game?
p280/p280_242|What do we want to do that for?
p280/p280_103|We were under a bit of pressure.
p280/p280_106|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p280/p280_271|That's been the difference between the sides.
p280/p280_026|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p280/p280_035|It is about control of our economy.
p280/p280_294|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p280/p280_028|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p280/p280_062|The referee is there to decide these things.
p280/p280_246|I think, therefore I am?
p280/p280_141|I am not under any new pressure.
p280/p280_184|We have come a long way since then.
p280/p280_114|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p280/p280_254|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p280/p280_087|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p280/p280_267|The board do not own the company.
p280/p280_370|I have come here to show support for the families.
p280/p280_340|Do I have a favourite?
p280/p280_143|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p280/p280_385|Why do it otherwise?
p280/p280_232|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p280/p280_290|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p280/p280_374|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p280/p280_346|It was a bit like having children.
p280/p280_371|We have been going for three years.
p280/p280_154|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p280/p280_218|A European final must be the millennium target.
p280/p280_149|Is it in the right place?
p280/p280_148|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p280/p280_237|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p280/p280_403|These old songs are very nice to play.
p280/p280_095|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p280/p280_191|You are not long home from work.
p280/p280_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p280/p280_206|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p280/p280_318|I always felt they played for me.
p280/p280_137|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p280/p280_172|He said some things which were better left alone.
p280/p280_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p280/p280_375|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p280/p280_351|I think we are back on track.
p280/p280_348|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p280/p280_042|He does not even trust his own members.
p280/p280_138|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p280/p280_183|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p280/p280_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p280/p280_307|It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
p280/p280_025|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p280/p280_213|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p280/p280_092|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p280/p280_315|If you believe in the blue and white.
p280/p280_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p280/p280_187|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p280/p280_376|It used to be all hard sell.
p280/p280_240|Was it the wife?
p280/p280_163|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p280/p280_405|I'd never seen a play about me.
p280/p280_349|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p280/p280_057|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p280/p280_181|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p280/p280_030|She brought a lot to my life.
p280/p280_365|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p280/p280_093|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p280/p280_055|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p280/p280_310|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p280/p280_209|They are a victim of their own success.
p280/p280_268|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p280/p280_321|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p280/p280_205|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p280/p280_241|Why change it?
p280/p280_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p280/p280_076|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p280/p280_229|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p280/p280_054|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p280/p280_125|I think there's not much between them.
p280/p280_176|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p280/p280_288|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p280/p280_292|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p280/p280_245|What are you not good at?
p280/p280_276|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p280/p280_228|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p280/p280_200|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p280/p280_221|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p280/p280_072|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p280/p280_170|That is a big risk at any price.
p280/p280_085|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p280/p280_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p280/p280_182|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p280/p280_207|I want an answer from the British Government.
p280/p280_296|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p280/p280_061|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p280/p280_208|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p280/p280_269|They always want to give a performance.
p280/p280_082|It's been a great evening for us.
p280/p280_196|was everything done to save people?
p280/p280_252|The rise has come too late for some.
p280/p280_298|It is based on population rather than need.
p280/p280_277|I think the shares are good value.
p280/p280_360|They have the cash and the fire power.
p280/p280_053|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p280/p280_128|We have to offer value for money.
p280/p280_142|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p280/p280_250|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p280/p280_171|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p280/p280_122|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p280/p280_220|I was independent but I am not now.
p280/p280_248|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p280/p280_406|We were on top and could have won.
p280/p280_235|You are not allowed to do that.
p280/p280_073|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p280/p280_236|That is the last thing they need.
p280/p280_359|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p280/p280_098|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p280/p280_058|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p280/p280_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p280/p280_300|So, did she meet him?
p280/p280_120|It is the right package for Scotland.
p280/p280_177|It's just a different way of life.
p280/p280_111|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p280/p280_051|I'm as fit as I can get.
p280/p280_185|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p280/p280_238|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p280/p280_159|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p280/p280_153|Do you think we are a top nation?
p280/p280_037|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p280/p280_344|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p280/p280_372|He really played us into a corner.
p280/p280_029|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p280/p280_387|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p280/p280_317|He will just go on doing his job.
p280/p280_134|There is no future in rock music.
p280/p280_389|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p280/p280_204|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p280/p280_145|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p280/p280_146|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p280/p280_327|I try to be open to experience.
p280/p280_227|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p280/p280_402|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
p280/p280_313|For that reason cover should not be given.
p280/p280_038|He added that her comments were noted.
p280/p280_243|Does the name matter?
p280/p280_115|So what happens next?
p280/p280_216|I am not going to judge them.
p280/p280_174|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p280/p280_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p280/p280_091|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p280/p280_094|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p280/p280_186|A great player has to win major championships.
p280/p280_273|I think I was about four years old.
p280/p280_202|I've never had a year like this.
p280/p280_342|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p280/p280_201|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p280/p280_373|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p280/p280_150|Did he trip?
p280/p280_102|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p280/p280_131|He's got to look after himself now.
p280/p280_036|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p280/p280_323|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p280/p280_397|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p280/p280_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p280/p280_077|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p280/p280_282|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p280/p280_123|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p280/p280_048|After the match, do you?
p280/p280_031|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p280/p280_377|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p280/p280_180|I am secure in my own position.
p280/p280_364|Both players gave so much to the side.
p280/p280_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p280/p280_165|But the game is still wide open.
p280/p280_279|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p280/p280_338|How are you, sir?
p280/p280_086|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p280/p280_258|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p280/p280_081|I do not attempt to answer that.
p280/p280_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p280/p280_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p280/p280_284|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p280/p280_249|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p312/p312_176|Robert is a special talent.
p312/p312_092|I am very encouraged by this poll.
p312/p312_349|Parents should avoid it.
p312/p312_084|There are many children.
p312/p312_124|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p312/p312_132|The police have to act to help them.
p312/p312_287|In the end, that was enough to beat England.
p312/p312_298|Bill is a mentor.
p312/p312_210|The next few months will tell.
p312/p312_290|He's also thinking long-term.
p312/p312_382|The urgency is real.
p312/p312_217|Is it in the right place?
p312/p312_304|I think however, he was having a fit!
p312/p312_155|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p312/p312_418|However, the report was incorrect.
p312/p312_083|I've played them all in the Champions League.
p312/p312_395|This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
p312/p312_313|And they did just that.
p312/p312_411|It was chaotic and frightening.
p312/p312_399|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
p312/p312_288|That was the initial attraction.
p312/p312_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p312/p312_095|It will be a challenging film.
p312/p312_390|It is part and parcel of it.
p312/p312_255|It lasted longer than we thought.
p312/p312_114|Where do you think she is going?
p312/p312_143|It's a fantastic achievement.
p312/p312_339|He had a horror.
p312/p312_225|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p312/p312_317|Our system is archaic.
p312/p312_080|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
p312/p312_090|I thought his speech was a disgrace.
p312/p312_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p312/p312_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p312/p312_316|They had three children.
p312/p312_201|Now there's a thought.
p312/p312_112|I believe he could have turned it around.
p312/p312_378|We are very nearly there.
p312/p312_407|There is no easy answer.
p312/p312_091|But these things are happening now.
p312/p312_272|I don't know what he was shouting.
p312/p312_273|It is the icing on the cake.
p312/p312_148|He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
p312/p312_205|They told him to go to drama school.
p312/p312_108|Then there was her childhood.
p312/p312_195|I love this tournament.
p312/p312_328|It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
p312/p312_194|However, we came through.
p312/p312_262|That would be a big mistake.
p312/p312_241|Partly, it is his own fault.
p312/p312_253|He leaves a beat.
p312/p312_311|It's not the end of the matter, of course.
p312/p312_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
p312/p312_363|He can do everything.
p312/p312_384|It was only logical to end it.
p312/p312_171|They have got off with murder.
p312/p312_240|Our commitment is to move forward.
p312/p312_051|I was in the zone in the morning.
p312/p312_322|We don't have the credible evidence.
p312/p312_269|She would say he was still the best.
p312/p312_187|We played too deeply.
p312/p312_392|It's the whole season.
p312/p312_416|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
p312/p312_196|He had a heart problem.
p312/p312_088|Either system could have prevented the crash.
p312/p312_085|That never seemed likely.
p312/p312_037|That decision is now being appealed.
p312/p312_067|I think it's more important to have fun.
p312/p312_230|He was replaced by John Spencer.
p312/p312_147|I've never regretted coming here.
p312/p312_308|Chris Paterson was outstanding.
p312/p312_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p312/p312_345|Then came the second round.
p312/p312_358|It's just so sad.
p312/p312_275|The people here are quite reserved.
p312/p312_048|The group will report back in the summer.
p312/p312_352|And she's not even in the book!
p312/p312_284|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p312/p312_086|Action must be taken urgently.
p312/p312_404|If so, they were wrong.
p312/p312_128|The pain is still acute.
p312/p312_159|The world is being invited to visit.
p312/p312_111|It's so much more fun.
p312/p312_035|It was quite distressing for the crew.
p312/p312_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p312/p312_118|It's a double whammy.
p312/p312_394|We are keen to have him back.
p312/p312_285|Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
p312/p312_027|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
p312/p312_165|He had played well in that central role.
p312/p312_126|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p312/p312_245|Why has it taken so long?
p312/p312_229|We're going to see more extreme weather.
p312/p312_249|These will finally be corrected by next week.
p312/p312_375|It was a long time coming.
p312/p312_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
p312/p312_105|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p312/p312_137|I was blown out of proportion.
p312/p312_234|It was worth the wait.
p312/p312_216|There were no casualties.
p312/p312_103|There may be some resistance.
p312/p312_403|No-one has yet been charged.
p312/p312_026|This was a rationing decision.
p312/p312_297|It is highly unlikely.
p312/p312_236|It will take place in July.
p312/p312_151|I fell into it by accident.
p312/p312_040|Not so, it transpires.
p312/p312_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p312/p312_364|She was just that sort of person.
p312/p312_190|We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
p312/p312_366|You've gotten all the facts.
p312/p312_279|These were the edited highlights.
p312/p312_332|We do things in an appropriate way.
p312/p312_174|I cannot say anymore.
p312/p312_197|I am desperate to play for Scotland.
p312/p312_098|He added, The old system has reached its limits.
p312/p312_294|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p312/p312_388|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p312/p312_094|They thought the set-up there was unfair.
p312/p312_207|Let us hope so.
p312/p312_235|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p312/p312_268|We're still talking about it.
p312/p312_314|You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
p312/p312_286|It is all one-sided.
p312/p312_170|A number of people could not speak English.
p312/p312_386|I've no passion for any country.
p312/p312_223|He is a very nice man.
p312/p312_306|You can't do one without the other.
p312/p312_379|Stand by for action.
p312/p312_125|There was some merit in that.
p312/p312_251|All would be under threat.
p312/p312_213|You can see their point.
p312/p312_338|It's part of your life.
p312/p312_102|They're just a nonsense.
p312/p312_057|This is welcome news.
p312/p312_065|All were later allowed home.
p312/p312_100|The plot is minimal.
p312/p312_324|It's one up to the Scots.
p312/p312_206|Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
p312/p312_244|I won't go back.
p312/p312_414|The proposals have been taken out of context.
p312/p312_079|The goal will come.
p312/p312_350|It was not a difficult decision, he said.
p312/p312_276|Previously police had said that schools were safe.
p312/p312_163|I'm not sure.
p312/p312_319|We want to know about the policy.
p312/p312_343|This is perfectly legal.
p312/p312_337|But he did not rule out further talks.
p312/p312_204|I was on the pitch and everything.
p312/p312_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p312/p312_341|This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
p312/p312_302|What makes a house a home?
p312/p312_180|I think it can count against you now.
p312/p312_056|My only concern is for my children.
p312/p312_389|That's an old idea.
p312/p312_073|I am still waiting for a reply.
p312/p312_199|We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
p312/p312_233|And, also, when he does not have the ball.
p312/p312_362|We are in a learning curve.
p312/p312_261|It was that bad, that low.
p312/p312_031|This is excellent news for the workforce.
p312/p312_099|We could easily be cut again.
p312/p312_342|That was the biggest game of my life.
p312/p312_161|I think it's a sensible change.
p312/p312_033|Haven't been so lucky since.
p312/p312_400|Do what you have to do.
p312/p312_410|He supported the decision to review the decision.
p312/p312_064|I've not said anything to them, they know.
p312/p312_401|We must do well in that.
p312/p312_068|Who did the recruiting?
p312/p312_041|I shouldn't have put up with it.
p312/p312_296|I was first in the door.
p312/p312_415|Golf has lost a great character.
p312/p312_370|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p312/p312_034|Well, you might have a point.
p312/p312_186|I'm going to see my friend.
p312/p312_231|Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
p312/p312_417|I have to say, for me, the game was not.
p312/p312_036|Now the show is for public consumption.
p312/p312_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p312/p312_270|He finished the night in a cell.
p312/p312_295|She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
p312/p312_405|This is my big break.
p312/p312_374|It's such a tragedy.
p312/p312_110|I thought that all musicians were the same.
p312/p312_042|I think so - he seems to be in good health.
p312/p312_030|I've got the poster.
p312/p312_293|It would also take time.
p312/p312_072|It showed him the way to drive.
p312/p312_115|This looks like it's anything but open.
p312/p312_359|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p312/p312_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p312/p312_281|They were totally behind it.
p312/p312_189|There is a lot of heroin about.
p312/p312_353|Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
p312/p312_291|A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
p312/p312_242|It's a personal matter.
p312/p312_173|This remains the party's policy.
p312/p312_078|However, there would be no permanent displays.
p312/p312_303|Destruction came from within.
p312/p312_150|We still have a long, long way to go.
p312/p312_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p312/p312_162|Sex is fun?
p312/p312_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p312/p312_212|But my daughter has got nothing.
p312/p312_038|This is really good news for us.
p312/p312_149|I am so, so, so lucky.
p312/p312_055|They have a car and cannot afford another.
p312/p312_238|This is a major step forward for carers.
p312/p312_412|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p312/p312_049|Back then it was hard to refuse.
p312/p312_116|I am not against a further inquiry.
p312/p312_059|The trust has no magic wand.
p312/p312_136|I am so upset.
p312/p312_123|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
p312/p312_153|Where does it come from?
p312/p312_357|It's better to be happy.
p312/p312_365|Is it a warning to parents?
p312/p312_169|Who would be out there, singing?
p312/p312_385|Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
p312/p312_391|The only safe investment is cash.
p312/p312_168|What's it for, after all?
p312/p312_373|He said he needed no more evidence.
p312/p312_409|I put pressure on him.
p312/p312_211|It felt like my support system was leaving.
p312/p312_367|And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
p312/p312_323|That will be the case on Tuesday.
p312/p312_164|His first album was a hit.
p312/p312_117|Such is the scene of the tragedy.
p312/p312_179|You can't keep them separate.
p312/p312_226|Such a city does not exist.
p312/p312_081|We didn't take our chances.
p312/p312_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p312/p312_096|The test case is still awaiting action.
p312/p312_310|I would say so.
p312/p312_122|This latter suggestion is very important.
p312/p312_101|The scheme is hopelessly failing.
p312/p312_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p312/p312_221|I love you so very much.
p312/p312_032|We have a high quality product.
p312/p312_413|He will never walk the streets again.
p312/p312_167|It was visibly on fire.
p312/p312_292|Trevor has been great.
p312/p312_351|It was a horrible thing to happen.
p312/p312_283|We could do a lot worse.
p312/p312_224|We want to sort it out.
p312/p312_214|Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
p312/p312_330|She is a great talent.
p312/p312_376|Gordon Brown was superb.
p312/p312_069|It is still with Ministers.
p312/p312_361|It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
p312/p312_371|Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
p312/p312_184|There was a substantial explosion.
p312/p312_336|He will be advised by me.
p312/p312_076|He was charged with perjury.
p312/p312_252|Was it a foul?
p312/p312_257|It hasn't happened, but other things have.
p312/p312_372|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
p312/p312_380|Barry will be able to handle this.
p312/p312_082|It was all very proper and civilised.
p312/p312_243|That's where it all started.
p312/p312_097|What happens next?
p312/p312_109|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p312/p312_139|It's the same with us.
p312/p312_397|And we all understand that.
p312/p312_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p312/p312_087|I was brought up in a mining background.
p312/p312_398|The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
p312/p312_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p312/p312_377|The referee didn't do his job.
p312/p312_202|I believe that the answer is simple.
p312/p312_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p312/p312_289|Who will take them after that?
p312/p312_263|His arrival could be the making of them.
p312/p312_259|Who is he?
p312/p312_061|It was a virus.
p312/p312_256|Promises were not kept.
p312/p312_228|It was no avail.
p312/p312_135|But what lies ahead?
p312/p312_237|We must not give in to the bastards.
p312/p312_029|Blood samples were taken.
p312/p312_044|This is not a monument to the past.
p312/p312_208|She looked very settled.
p312/p312_181|He was a legend.
p312/p312_178|It was very, very dejected.
p312/p312_232|That is in the very nature of farming.
p312/p312_344|That's the most important thing for me.
p312/p312_191|He never asked me for money.
p312/p312_077|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
p312/p312_198|It is a large number.
p312/p312_050|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p312/p312_246|You make the choice.
p312/p312_335|The playing is perfectly turned out.
p312/p312_419|There was no pressure at all.
p312/p312_402|She died later on Monday.
p312/p312_354|I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
p312/p312_355|He, too, is killing.
p312/p312_045|I certainly hope not.
p312/p312_028|He is doing the right things.
p312/p312_160|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
p312/p312_200|Hear what they have to say.
p312/p312_278|The past is history, not destiny.
p312/p312_106|The Rangers think they have problems.
p312/p312_320|It is not illegal.
p312/p312_247|And does it?
p312/p312_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p312/p312_140|It's an awful lot of money.
p312/p312_158|That says something for his strength of character.
p312/p312_408|There was someone on the floor.
p312/p312_182|That's when the story first appeared.
p312/p312_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p312/p312_203|That, he claimed, was essential.
p312/p312_157|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
p312/p312_219|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p312/p312_089|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
p312/p312_043|I think it must be the uniforms.
p312/p312_348|We told them in June.
p312/p312_239|I think it was his parents.
p312/p312_131|Frustration is not the word.
p312/p312_062|The rest, of course, is history.
p312/p312_053|In fact, it might just be the beginning.
p312/p312_381|However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
p312/p312_300|I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
p312/p312_266|You are a liar.
p312/p312_144|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
p312/p312_356|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
p312/p312_075|Were they under-age?
p312/p312_282|However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
p312/p312_325|This is complete nonsense.
p312/p312_070|The effect was almost magical.
p312/p312_331|It's the big omission.
p312/p312_334|However, she is female, and so.
p312/p312_307|Obviously we want to stop the rot.
p312/p312_305|It is good to look back.
p312/p312_166|And who would argue with that?
p312/p312_138|There was a definite prejudice.
p312/p312_209|Of course he was right!
p312/p312_188|I probably would have been a dancer.
p312/p312_185|He will continue to provide support for them.
p312/p312_396|Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
p312/p312_046|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
p312/p312_267|The scheme has been funded by the Government.
p312/p312_387|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
p312/p312_156|It is almost certain to be the last.
p312/p312_250|This kind of traffic is commonplace.
p312/p312_054|The children are being very brave.
p312/p312_280|All were within range of Israeli cities.
p312/p312_264|After all, this is the start of the giving age.
p312/p312_063|They chose the latter.
p312/p312_340|We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
p312/p312_360|And Scotland is no different.
p312/p312_271|I'm not afraid of that.
p312/p312_177|They are going to carry it through.
p312/p312_145|He, too, was not satisfied.
p312/p312_326|I don't want to use the term.
p312/p312_220|They are still going to be impulsive.
p312/p312_047|I feel pretty good.
p312/p312_121|For me, it was a shattering experience.
p312/p312_152|I only wanted to give her a fright.
p312/p312_130|It is a very big problem.
p312/p312_052|We have to break that cycle.
p312/p312_315|She has left the island.
p312/p312_142|This should include procedures for personal imports.
p312/p312_218|I played well in my time there.
p312/p312_346|Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
p312/p312_258|The claim was denied by first minister.
p312/p312_129|His remit is specific.
p312/p312_260|It has to be long-term commitment.
p312/p312_318|She had kept the news from him.
p312/p312_368|Soon the whole country will be level.
p312/p312_254|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
p312/p312_039|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
p312/p312_120|We are satisfied that this is the case.
p312/p312_093|They should be swept away.
p312/p312_146|It's easy to see why.
p312/p312_141|He was the architect.
p312/p312_154|Norman was not doing so bad, either.
p312/p312_071|It happened again, and again, and again.
p312/p312_309|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p312/p312_119|What's the theme?
p312/p312_183|You're going to die.
p312/p312_369|And huge, indeed, it is.
p312/p312_192|I was a bit nervous.
p312/p312_175|They want this research to continue.
p312/p312_134|It may be down, but New York is not out.
p312/p312_227|It made me determined to get back.
p312/p312_301|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
p312/p312_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p312/p312_299|The atmosphere is businesslike.
p312/p312_113|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
p312/p312_265|I said How much?
p312/p312_058|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
p312/p312_193|There was no question of him not impressing.
p312/p312_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p312/p312_074|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
p312/p312_321|I wouldn't say this is normal.
p312/p312_329|It's all happening at a local level.
p312/p312_222|The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
p312/p312_025|Perhaps that was their mistake.
p312/p312_393|We had no choice but to go down.
p312/p312_347|Saddam is not threatening this country.
p312/p312_327|There is still hope.
p312/p312_277|Our legal advice is clear.
p312/p312_172|Charges against the pair were found not proven.
p312/p312_133|She was extremely rigid.
p312/p312_248|I was proud of our lads.
p312/p312_312|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p312/p312_127|What's wrong with that?
p312/p312_104|I could not believe it.
p312/p312_107|He will go a long way.
p312/p312_060|We just wish they had done so before.
p312/p312_274|It was a new ball game.
p312/p312_215|The dangers are very obvious.
p312/p312_406|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p312/p312_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p312/p312_066|Will you just put it away?
p312/p312_383|They have been for some time now.
p261/p261_072|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p261/p261_139|Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
p261/p261_211|I chose to go by the rules.
p261/p261_463|Let that be their memorial.
p261/p261_202|We believe a third party was involved.
p261/p261_382|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p261/p261_443|It is a case of pity for us.
p261/p261_281|The offer will run for the next three weekends.
p261/p261_367|Finally came the moment of truth.
p261/p261_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p261/p261_112|It became a national network.
p261/p261_168|What happened in that game?
p261/p261_397|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p261/p261_244|I haven't made the donation yet.
p261/p261_038|This represents a tough game for us.
p261/p261_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p261/p261_061|What do we do?
p261/p261_055|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p261/p261_393|The pair are very much in love.
p261/p261_318|He was obviously very genuine.
p261/p261_396|However, it was well worth the wait.
p261/p261_226|It was a day for records.
p261/p261_239|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p261/p261_053|The motive for the shooting was not known.
p261/p261_117|It's not a quick fix.
p261/p261_387|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p261/p261_448|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p261/p261_087|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p261/p261_295|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p261/p261_083|They lived for their children.
p261/p261_146|Like the others, he was arrested.
p261/p261_427|He's had to suffer for the last six years.
p261/p261_335|I would do away with the dress code.
p261/p261_217|It was far from business as usual.
p261/p261_417|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p261/p261_141|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p261/p261_242|This is a family club.
p261/p261_150|It was by the numbers.
p261/p261_148|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p261/p261_144|I would relish the prospect.
p261/p261_132|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p261/p261_428|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p261/p261_439|I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
p261/p261_209|Who was she?
p261/p261_164|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p261/p261_190|DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
p261/p261_129|You are a gambling man.
p261/p261_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p261/p261_040|Among them are many criminals.
p261/p261_059|So is that it, then?
p261/p261_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p261/p261_060|Do I have a favourite?
p261/p261_103|Our house was very small.
p261/p261_306|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p261/p261_163|You had to go and see him.
p261/p261_445|The first game is so important.
p261/p261_172|What do we want to do that for?
p261/p261_234|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p261/p261_034|This film will be totally awesome.
p261/p261_212|I won't make an official complaint.
p261/p261_159|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p261/p261_046|It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
p261/p261_174|I always felt they played for me.
p261/p261_215|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p261/p261_273|Did he trip?
p261/p261_350|Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
p261/p261_246|The irony was not lost.
p261/p261_286|They can leave at any time.
p261/p261_423|The case will now go to appeal.
p261/p261_079|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p261/p261_294|It was an easy decision to come here.
p261/p261_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p261/p261_123|The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
p261/p261_320|It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
p261/p261_131|This is a successful outcome.
p261/p261_471|I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
p261/p261_058|How are you, sir?
p261/p261_416|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p261/p261_383|They should take their mobile phones.
p261/p261_430|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p261/p261_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p261/p261_421|The second goal was superb.
p261/p261_313|Tony Blair said as little.
p261/p261_291|He has run a hell of a race.
p261/p261_183|Says the Duke of York.
p261/p261_375|Does it matter?
p261/p261_062|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p261/p261_041|I was released after six days.
p261/p261_467|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p261/p261_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p261/p261_136|She died at her home.
p261/p261_390|The result is called a patent.
p261/p261_230|A terrorist is a terrorist.
p261/p261_311|He will address the nation this evening.
p261/p261_447|And we might go back.
p261/p261_464|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p261/p261_365|He was then replaced by Ross.
p261/p261_360|It's too horrible to think.
p261/p261_342|Is there a waiting list?
p261/p261_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p261/p261_474|My place is in the kitchen.
p261/p261_149|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p261/p261_063|Only water is currently allowed.
p261/p261_453|I was embarrassed by it.
p261/p261_345|This ruling is a farce.
p261/p261_125|If not, a deal could take many months.
p261/p261_143|The balance isn't there at EMI.
p261/p261_296|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p261/p261_402|We operate as a Scottish company.
p261/p261_153|He was asked to quit.
p261/p261_422|We're delighted about the vote.
p261/p261_317|Holland won by five wickets.
p261/p261_048|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p261/p261_284|The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
p261/p261_204|It was his own decision.
p261/p261_156|These days are long gone.
p261/p261_252|Nato was not a love affair.
p261/p261_152|We will turn the corner.
p261/p261_348|The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
p261/p261_353|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p261/p261_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p261/p261_243|It is the loss of my name.
p261/p261_177|The jury is still out.
p261/p261_176|It is a body blow.
p261/p261_220|It has been like that all year for me.
p261/p261_066|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p261/p261_029|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p261/p261_425|Yet the data is compelling.
p261/p261_037|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p261/p261_047|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p261/p261_076|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p261/p261_167|They could not match it.
p261/p261_161|The pension levels will remain the same.
p261/p261_121|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p261/p261_248|It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
p261/p261_115|It isn't a happy memory.
p261/p261_126|That would open the gates of hell.
p261/p261_265|This idea has been around for four years.
p261/p261_192|It was a pre-emptive strike.
p261/p261_314|His was a huge success story.
p261/p261_378|But they have taken the lesson to heart.
p261/p261_280|The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
p261/p261_200|I made a terrible start.
p261/p261_026|Meetings will also remain private.
p261/p261_194|Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
p261/p261_349|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p261/p261_322|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p261/p261_364|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p261/p261_175|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p261/p261_258|We will listen to any suggestion.
p261/p261_460|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
p261/p261_458|Our legal advice is clear.
p261/p261_227|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p261/p261_414|It is good for Europe.
p261/p261_307|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p261/p261_330|You will never get a conviction.
p261/p261_420|Smoking is also very important.
p261/p261_109|And does it?
p261/p261_264|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p261/p261_289|He has not created a Festival resource.
p261/p261_465|She would take the Farmer to the opera.
p261/p261_206|how do you get it back?
p261/p261_449|He deserves a second chance.
p261/p261_233|The statement contained no surprises.
p261/p261_328|That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
p261/p261_343|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p261/p261_437|It was the climax of the thing.
p261/p261_154|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p261/p261_065|It's not covered by the insurance.
p261/p261_080|We have to offer value for money.
p261/p261_385|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p261/p261_068|It starts with the script.
p261/p261_283|I am just trying to do my job.
p261/p261_298|A senior party insider said.
p261/p261_182|I will be in Scotland.
p261/p261_331|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p261/p261_160|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p261/p261_332|That meant the search was unlawful.
p261/p261_361|They are now out in the cold.
p261/p261_122|I was on a roll.
p261/p261_381|You did not see it.
p261/p261_135|The others have all been in storage for some time.
p261/p261_446|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p261/p261_178|It is not either national standards or local control.
p261/p261_333|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p261/p261_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p261/p261_162|I would probably have to agree with him.
p261/p261_405|After the match, do you?
p261/p261_028|Life was like a timetable.
p261/p261_134|We will try to find someone.
p261/p261_064|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p261/p261_462|They were totally behind it.
p261/p261_001|Please call Stella.
p261/p261_228|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p261/p261_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p261/p261_214|They are looking at a flotation.
p261/p261_340|Are they free?
p261/p261_196|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p261/p261_259|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p261/p261_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p261/p261_140|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p261/p261_279|That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
p261/p261_368|Neither man has been charged.
p261/p261_341|What are they for?
p261/p261_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p261/p261_394|I am a good player.
p261/p261_392|This remains the party's policy.
p261/p261_299|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p261/p261_203|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p261/p261_438|The trial will open today.
p261/p261_401|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p261/p261_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p261/p261_098|I had a ball today.
p261/p261_240|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p261/p261_111|I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
p261/p261_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p261/p261_431|That's the way it works.
p261/p261_362|At first, the youngster was not keen.
p261/p261_272|Is it in the right place?
p261/p261_216|We have an election in eight days.
p261/p261_238|They tried to give her advice.
p261/p261_096|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p261/p261_287|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p261/p261_133|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p261/p261_225|He must get to know himself.
p261/p261_197|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p261/p261_263|It seems a shame to leave it.
p261/p261_165|Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
p261/p261_358|There was some merit in that.
p261/p261_188|That is a waste of energy.
p261/p261_309|We will deliver at director level.
p261/p261_086|However, it did not end that way.
p261/p261_127|He can perform well under pressure.
p261/p261_444|Gordon is also highly rated.
p261/p261_075|These people are not big names.
p261/p261_201|It was a moment of madness.
p261/p261_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p261/p261_451|The funding is now there.
p261/p261_032|It was a close call.
p261/p261_173|This is no reflection on Rangers.
p261/p261_329|The City welcomed the numbers.
p261/p261_187|He prefers to play for them.
p261/p261_179|City sentiment is in his favour.
p261/p261_151|But I am still awaiting an answer.
p261/p261_415|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p261/p261_282|At first I thought I was gone.
p261/p261_116|Actors like to be in the centre.
p261/p261_166|The region is open for business.
p261/p261_324|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p261/p261_030|We will look into it.
p261/p261_434|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p261/p261_424|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p261/p261_441|It is an absolute nonsense.
p261/p261_266|The concerns are the same.
p261/p261_388|He must have seen the movie.
p261/p261_275|I was ready for this.
p261/p261_290|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p261/p261_251|They showed a lot of heart.
p261/p261_351|The whole family was in shock.
p261/p261_376|He took a draw on his cigarette.
p261/p261_191|That was the theory, anyway.
p261/p261_398|I wanted to go out on a high.
p261/p261_297|He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
p261/p261_097|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p261/p261_302|The two companies were not for sale.
p261/p261_207|What are you not good at?
p261/p261_391|It's as wide as a church in here.
p261/p261_249|I was just a kid.
p261/p261_241|No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
p261/p261_236|They have not been in touch with the club.
p261/p261_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p261/p261_374|Is it worth it?
p261/p261_300|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p261/p261_257|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p261/p261_339|What form did that take?
p261/p261_389|We must put a marker down.
p261/p261_107|So, did she meet him?
p261/p261_057|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p261/p261_158|We have to move forward.
p261/p261_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p261/p261_285|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p261/p261_052|It is on the news.
p261/p261_108|So what is the campaign about?
p261/p261_114|Maybe this battle has been.
p261/p261_157|The bank was now involved.
p261/p261_316|That is the general feeling.
p261/p261_354|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p261/p261_326|It is a potential danger.
p261/p261_181|These men could be anywhere in the world.
p261/p261_470|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p261/p261_043|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p261/p261_371|He did a good job.
p261/p261_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p261/p261_027|Because we do not need it.
p261/p261_459|It all began as an accident.
p261/p261_120|I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
p261/p261_171|Why change it?
p261/p261_254|It was a poor performance.
p261/p261_071|Then followed a bout of flu.
p261/p261_099|No, the equipment is extra.
p261/p261_400|It was fit for royalty.
p261/p261_440|It will make a huge difference.
p261/p261_069|There could be a way back.
p261/p261_356|I've got a sense of humour, too.
p261/p261_411|I had a fortunate war.
p261/p261_235|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p261/p261_256|We want to play at the worlds.
p261/p261_247|We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
p261/p261_138|Check that he is dead.
p261/p261_384|We regret that they were brought in the first place.
p261/p261_231|It could be to do with the location.
p261/p261_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p261/p261_180|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p261/p261_301|This will help our confidence.
p261/p261_278|They are interior designers and architects.
p261/p261_334|There will be good prospects ahead.
p261/p261_155|The strong pound also took its toll.
p261/p261_305|The cause of the accident remained unclear.
p261/p261_469|They are defined by law.
p261/p261_409|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p261/p261_372|Had this been common practice?
p261/p261_056|We will pay their bills.
p261/p261_450|You have to see the work.
p261/p261_219|They have known the hard times.
p261/p261_377|I am a lucky man.
p261/p261_199|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p261/p261_319|The casting is as perfect.
p261/p261_092|It was clear on Thursday.
p261/p261_410|Motion described it as a unique event.
p261/p261_432|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p261/p261_124|My life has changed a lot.
p261/p261_198|He should emerge as the winner.
p261/p261_429|He was on a horse.
p261/p261_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p261/p261_250|It is now the big brother.
p261/p261_093|But it is up again.
p261/p261_288|It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
p261/p261_433|It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
p261/p261_110|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p261/p261_185|I had too much to drink.
p261/p261_366|He is not very big, either.
p261/p261_221|Construction is due to begin in February.
p261/p261_081|Our mother is very worried.
p261/p261_321|A Home Office spokesman said.
p261/p261_208|I think, therefore I am?
p261/p261_193|It had been in place since last July.
p261/p261_232|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p261/p261_261|No production contract is yet in sight.
p261/p261_128|I have accepted the challenge.
p261/p261_455|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p261/p261_303|Her appeal is to be heard this week.
p261/p261_054|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p261/p261_045|He will need that machine.
p261/p261_454|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p261/p261_395|You have to rely on each other.
p261/p261_271|Do I think about them often?
p261/p261_105|Why do it otherwise?
p261/p261_344|So what happens next?
p261/p261_169|Are you going to win?
p261/p261_255|That is the consistent approach of the Government.
p261/p261_031|I have never been a member of the council.
p261/p261_106|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p261/p261_085|They deserve a lot of credit.
p261/p261_039|Their campaign is in disarray.
p261/p261_269|was everything done to save people?
p261/p261_337|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p261/p261_442|Everything in golf is a balance.
p261/p261_088|It is high time to act.
p261/p261_078|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p261/p261_327|Cast Away now on general release.
p261/p261_090|However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
p261/p261_277|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p261/p261_077|He is in the queue.
p261/p261_044|I would love to have him home.
p261/p261_292|It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
p261/p261_403|How do you take them away?
p261/p261_373|What do they want us to do?
p261/p261_406|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p261/p261_218|All will be revealed in due course.
p261/p261_145|It has become a way of life.
p261/p261_435|He is on the wrong side.
p261/p261_268|And they were being paid?
p261/p261_386|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p261/p261_466|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p261/p261_413|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p261/p261_355|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p261/p261_472|It's been a long, long journey.
p261/p261_310|Size is not the issue.
p261/p261_067|That's not the intention at all.
p261/p261_253|He is due in Israel tomorrow.
p261/p261_346|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p261/p261_025|They are very clever in their use of words.
p261/p261_033|That means an extra two years.
p261/p261_276|They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
p261/p261_142|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p261/p261_049|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p261/p261_224|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p261/p261_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p261/p261_267|I can't get a job.
p261/p261_223|My daughter is an adult.
p261/p261_323|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p261/p261_312|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p261/p261_379|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p261/p261_101|Before the game we went for a pint.
p261/p261_363|My view has now completely changed.
p261/p261_042|That's been the difference between the sides.
p261/p261_213|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p261/p261_399|I felt the head was very like me.
p261/p261_426|It was important to win the singles.
p261/p261_237|I need a publishing deal!
p261/p261_147|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p261/p261_035|That was the case with David.
p261/p261_084|Potions said he would drive.
p261/p261_407|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p261/p261_195|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p261/p261_036|He is believed to live in Britain.
p261/p261_369|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p261/p261_091|We could not get any possession.
p261/p261_094|All the pressure will be on him.
p261/p261_050|There was no safety net.
p261/p261_412|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p261/p261_070|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p261/p261_205|Does the name matter?
p261/p261_119|Structural changes were also required.
p261/p261_089|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p261/p261_293|He was also married with two children.
p261/p261_137|We could easily have lost that game.
p261/p261_229|Life is too short to be bitter.
p261/p261_130|He is a great addition to our team.
p261/p261_184|Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
p261/p261_073|The price cuts are really exciting.
p261/p261_051|I must take a seat.
p261/p261_113|He thought she was amazing.
p261/p261_461|It might be useful to have something in black and white.
p261/p261_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p261/p261_274|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p261/p261_074|He is now resident in England.
p261/p261_082|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p261/p261_222|Seven people were critically injured.
p261/p261_418|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p261/p261_336|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p261/p261_436|By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
p261/p261_210|A deadline is still essential.
p261/p261_357|Her life is now back on track.
p261/p261_468|No options are excluded at all.
p261/p261_260|I should think so, too.
p261/p261_359|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p261/p261_325|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p261/p261_170|Was it the wife?
p261/p261_270|What was the matter for concern?
p261/p261_262|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p261/p261_457|No one wants to go through these things.
p261/p261_352|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p261/p261_308|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p261/p261_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p261/p261_315|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p261/p261_100|It is a good lifestyle.
p261/p261_473|War is not the action.
p261/p261_347|However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
p261/p261_245|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p261/p261_370|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p261/p261_104|It was a funny game.
p261/p261_186|They need to look after themselves.
p261/p261_095|You are like an animal.
p261/p261_419|But a surprise is in store.
p261/p261_404|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p261/p261_338|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p261/p261_304|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p261/p261_102|We are also looking for new licences.
p261/p261_456|Paris is not only young.
p261/p261_408|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p261/p261_118|But it took a lot of bottle.
p261/p261_380|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p261/p261_189|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p257/p257_025|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p257/p257_182|What has caused the demise of singing?
p257/p257_091|We must look forward.
p257/p257_273|You've got to have both sides.
p257/p257_249|I watched a game.
p257/p257_262|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p257/p257_348|He could face a jail sentence.
p257/p257_321|Three years ago he would have been.
p257/p257_310|They had a confession.
p257/p257_242|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p257/p257_143|Nobody in the world can get away from him.
p257/p257_048|As she explains.
p257/p257_175|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p257/p257_135|Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
p257/p257_365|YOU thought it was a headache.
p257/p257_404|It is simple, but profound.
p257/p257_396|You wanted the evidence.
p257/p257_243|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p257/p257_171|There was no hint of scandal.
p257/p257_255|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p257/p257_066|I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
p257/p257_340|It was very formal.
p257/p257_368|They really did a great job.
p257/p257_274|Who did the recruiting?
p257/p257_070|The price cuts are really exciting.
p257/p257_386|He's already made history.
p257/p257_215|It's just a place to open it.
p257/p257_373|It is unusual.
p257/p257_053|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p257/p257_214|His death was a tragic accident.
p257/p257_405|No preference emerged.
p257/p257_209|It had all been arranged.
p257/p257_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p257/p257_147|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p257/p257_111|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p257/p257_123|You can spend money on housing.
p257/p257_124|That's all right then.
p257/p257_364|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p257/p257_166|You are not going in blind.
p257/p257_233|But it's a subtle process.
p257/p257_052|But the law is very clear on this.
p257/p257_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p257/p257_427|I was just overwhelmed.
p257/p257_303|They wanted the club to make money.
p257/p257_426|Mary Archer is almost too clever.
p257/p257_345|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p257/p257_341|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p257/p257_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p257/p257_064|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p257/p257_174|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p257/p257_224|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p257/p257_279|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p257/p257_042|We need to chat.
p257/p257_139|What will happen then?
p257/p257_109|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p257/p257_275|Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
p257/p257_057|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p257/p257_228|It is set in Paris.
p257/p257_397|Our numbers are small.
p257/p257_222|He demanded to speak to the boss.
p257/p257_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p257/p257_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p257/p257_389|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p257/p257_187|Saturday is gone.
p257/p257_380|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p257/p257_235|My future is in the marathon.
p257/p257_322|You feel the pride.
p257/p257_061|Scotland had great assets.
p257/p257_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p257/p257_103|We have every respect for Michelle.
p257/p257_318|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p257/p257_205|He is slightly confused.
p257/p257_165|I lost my head.
p257/p257_347|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p257/p257_063|Have a look at our accounts.
p257/p257_399|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p257/p257_176|It's quite a routine.
p257/p257_183|One was a lawyer.
p257/p257_430|The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
p257/p257_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p257/p257_126|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p257/p257_095|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p257/p257_115|We do not expect any surplus.
p257/p257_086|It's never too late.
p257/p257_046|It's a blessing.
p257/p257_054|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p257/p257_300|They were fantastic.
p257/p257_223|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p257/p257_088|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p257/p257_119|I'm delighted about that.
p257/p257_370|However, it's good to turn the page.
p257/p257_213|I might come back.
p257/p257_239|You can feel at home in China.
p257/p257_236|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p257/p257_351|I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
p257/p257_292|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p257/p257_093|He was possessed
p257/p257_099|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p257/p257_149|That group reported just before Christmas.
p257/p257_293|It's just not funny!
p257/p257_145|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p257/p257_078|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p257/p257_237|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p257/p257_334|It is not like working for a living.
p257/p257_179|Everyone can be bought.
p257/p257_265|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p257/p257_196|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p257/p257_367|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p257/p257_428|It had been in place since last July.
p257/p257_320|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p257/p257_092|It is an old family habit.
p257/p257_261|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p257/p257_159|He can do no wrong.
p257/p257_180|It is minute.
p257/p257_385|Emotions were complex.
p257/p257_130|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p257/p257_197|It's just awful.
p257/p257_170|My life has been destroyed.
p257/p257_029|Life was like a timetable.
p257/p257_118|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p257/p257_390|There was no trouble.
p257/p257_152|They did very well.
p257/p257_336|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p257/p257_188|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p257/p257_306|It should be equal.
p257/p257_398|I was very young.
p257/p257_360|I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
p257/p257_253|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p257/p257_416|Rather than answer, she resigned.
p257/p257_037|It was ugly.
p257/p257_043|The boy is no longer with us.
p257/p257_284|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p257/p257_339|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p257/p257_128|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p257/p257_362|He denied the charge.
p257/p257_257|Blood samples were taken.
p257/p257_363|There were no casualties.
p257/p257_358|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p257/p257_172|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
p257/p257_044|I hate the word.
p257/p257_072|I had my suspicions.
p257/p257_073|She died in hospital two hours later.
p257/p257_100|It was mayhem.
p257/p257_384|I never won a penny throughout my career.
p257/p257_295|The plot is minimal.
p257/p257_036|I was scared.
p257/p257_163|I've put my own money into this project.
p257/p257_338|The salary changes are long overdue.
p257/p257_132|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p257/p257_251|There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
p257/p257_271|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p257/p257_075|Is there a new way forward?
p257/p257_281|He should have won.
p257/p257_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p257/p257_031|It was clear.
p257/p257_391|This is a huge confidence boost.
p257/p257_335|It is long gone.
p257/p257_366|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p257/p257_296|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p257/p257_258|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p257/p257_312|We are in the end game.
p257/p257_278|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
p257/p257_245|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p257/p257_418|They said so that I would look good in uniform.
p257/p257_125|I was furious.
p257/p257_372|I'm pleased about one thing.
p257/p257_230|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p257/p257_294|I am very happy to be here.
p257/p257_342|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p257/p257_355|It is a large number.
p257/p257_417|War is not the action.
p257/p257_425|It is bizarre.
p257/p257_371|This year I understood.
p257/p257_252|they fail to engage.
p257/p257_178|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p257/p257_164|However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
p257/p257_154|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p257/p257_198|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p257/p257_056|It's very odd.
p257/p257_350|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p257/p257_264|We're in shock.
p257/p257_381|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p257/p257_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p257/p257_110|It is normal.
p257/p257_067|It's all I can do.
p257/p257_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p257/p257_127|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p257/p257_376|I can lead by example.
p257/p257_121|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p257/p257_038|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p257/p257_062|There will be tough opponents to this report.
p257/p257_158|There's a pause.
p257/p257_229|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p257/p257_120|Does this mean.
p257/p257_432|They will form a tribute.
p257/p257_354|It's a long process.
p257/p257_192|Off I went.
p257/p257_331|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p257/p257_168|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p257/p257_422|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p257/p257_282|A new school will be built.
p257/p257_211|We have got to get it right.
p257/p257_184|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p257/p257_193|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p257/p257_146|There is a lack of chemistry.
p257/p257_260|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p257/p257_382|It was on fire.
p257/p257_286|The home was now under new management.
p257/p257_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p257/p257_068|There could be a way back.
p257/p257_219|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p257/p257_304|Kids are terrible.
p257/p257_401|She is superb.
p257/p257_157|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p257/p257_096|The peace process will be buried!
p257/p257_207|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p257/p257_311|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p257/p257_327|Look at the witnesses.
p257/p257_317|I saw some good things.
p257/p257_309|It is out there.
p257/p257_112|I don't have many friends.
p257/p257_098|They are now divorced.
p257/p257_033|I came to complete.
p257/p257_248|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p257/p257_285|What has altered?
p257/p257_266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p257/p257_244|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p257/p257_302|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p257/p257_065|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p257/p257_421|It is marvellous.
p257/p257_392|Not because they want to sing about something.
p257/p257_028|Because we do not need it.
p257/p257_026|Is this accurate?
p257/p257_148|It is like a football team.
p257/p257_343|We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
p257/p257_420|One must hope not!
p257/p257_434|The bill would be massive.
p257/p257_419|It's not about defining styles.
p257/p257_217|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p257/p257_357|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
p257/p257_433|The whole region is in shock.
p257/p257_101|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p257/p257_333|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p257/p257_133|The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
p257/p257_199|IT S all in the hair.
p257/p257_034|President Bush is at war.
p257/p257_059|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p257/p257_105|I didn't play well last year.
p257/p257_097|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p257/p257_383|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p257/p257_424|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p257/p257_325|Indeed, it was magical.
p257/p257_142|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p257/p257_395|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p257/p257_250|They are interior designers and architects.
p257/p257_379|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p257/p257_315|I am so upset.
p257/p257_151|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p257/p257_206|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p257/p257_283|Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
p257/p257_353|There is no signature.
p257/p257_161|I've learned from my mistakes.
p257/p257_080|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p257/p257_150|He will emerge as a world leader.
p257/p257_352|Then followed a bout of flu.
p257/p257_247|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p257/p257_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p257/p257_407|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p257/p257_107|They will want to perform well.
p257/p257_369|There is a solution, she believes.
p257/p257_050|He had no enemies.
p257/p257_055|Next league matches Celtic.
p257/p257_040|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p257/p257_246|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p257/p257_138|It is also well received.
p257/p257_035|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p257/p257_267|One knows the feeling.
p257/p257_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p257/p257_114|It was the eighties.
p257/p257_203|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p257/p257_326|I've got no secret.
p257/p257_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p257/p257_288|I thought it was my only chance.
p257/p257_225|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p257/p257_220|We played them off the pitch.
p257/p257_240|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p257/p257_090|Today I couldn't run on it.
p257/p257_081|It may well have been.
p257/p257_045|That should do it.
p257/p257_200|We have an election in eight days.
p257/p257_272|He looked very sharp.
p257/p257_039|It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
p257/p257_378|They are good.
p257/p257_208|I am delighted for Simon.
p257/p257_195|Ferguson should take note.
p257/p257_083|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p257/p257_212|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p257/p257_194|He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
p257/p257_141|I feel very grateful with everything.
p257/p257_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p257/p257_394|We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
p257/p257_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p257/p257_117|It's not a new concept in jazz.
p257/p257_087|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p257/p257_328|I'm very lucky.
p257/p257_377|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p257/p257_060|There was a battle there.
p257/p257_415|We shall be victorious.
p257/p257_388|You ask the question.
p257/p257_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p257/p257_076|I've not thought about it.
p257/p257_393|It is not a standing army.
p257/p257_346|I felt really good until Friday.
p257/p257_408|She has reached the top of her profession.
p257/p257_116|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p257/p257_337|Tell us about it.
p257/p257_131|Who will attend?
p257/p257_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p257/p257_349|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p257/p257_324|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p257/p257_190|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p257/p257_319|You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
p257/p257_423|They should not be blamed for it.
p257/p257_001|Please call Stella.
p257/p257_089|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p257/p257_232|John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
p257/p257_049|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p257/p257_173|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p257/p257_276|Well, he can do it.
p257/p257_280|The results are sometimes contentious.
p257/p257_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p257/p257_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p257/p257_289|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p257/p257_290|It just came into my head that day.
p257/p257_268|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p257/p257_051|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p257/p257_409|It goes with the job.
p257/p257_079|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p257/p257_344|I wanted to go out on a high.
p257/p257_413|We are delighted with this outcome.
p257/p257_201|But I am a worried man.
p257/p257_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p257/p257_410|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p257/p257_241|I should think so, too.
p257/p257_134|I am now unemployed.
p257/p257_356|He knew his job inside out.
p257/p257_156|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p257/p257_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p257/p257_102|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p257/p257_291|They are wrong.
p257/p257_160|It was so new, so exciting.
p257/p257_375|It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
p257/p257_221|She really suffered for her art.
p257/p257_177|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p257/p257_254|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
p257/p257_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p257/p257_122|He did his job.
p257/p257_359|It does not even have a staff shortage.
p257/p257_108|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p257/p257_329|We must do something.
p257/p257_323|It is so unfair.
p257/p257_411|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p257/p257_137|Our intentions are real.
p257/p257_041|A neighbour said.
p257/p257_155|The weather forecast isn't good.
p257/p257_185|It was an odd affair, in many respects.
p257/p257_210|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p257/p257_403|It doesn't always work that way.
p257/p257_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p257/p257_263|And Michael was just great.
p257/p257_256|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p257/p257_186|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p257/p257_085|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p257/p257_298|This is the culture change in medicine.
p257/p257_071|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p257/p257_314|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p257/p257_069|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p257/p257_162|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p257/p257_030|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p257/p257_227|They had no children.
p257/p257_400|I am the Son of Sam.
p257/p257_202|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p257/p257_402|Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
p257/p257_307|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p257/p257_140|It's not true.
p257/p257_305|Henman has been warned.
p257/p257_234|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p257/p257_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p257/p257_189|Last night was a key episode.
p257/p257_297|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p257/p257_113|It's a shame.
p257/p257_077|People must remain vigilant.
p257/p257_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p257/p257_412|I recommend a tour.
p257/p257_259|It's very nice.
p257/p257_106|For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
p257/p257_269|She looked so young.
p257/p257_204|He knows a lot.
p257/p257_191|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p257/p257_082|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p257/p257_153|It became a book by itself.
p257/p257_277|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p257/p257_429|It's a miracle.
p257/p257_308|The home team had an amazing start.
p257/p257_299|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p257/p257_332|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p257/p257_181|They need to look after themselves.
p257/p257_330|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p257/p257_287|Graeme was prepared.
p257/p257_027|They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
p257/p257_301|I never thought it would take this long.
p257/p257_218|William Hague delighted his party.
p257/p257_144|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p257/p257_216|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p257/p257_406|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p257/p257_431|That was the first time I worked with Richard.
p257/p257_387|So I did.
p257/p257_374|It is also claimed that he was murdered.
p257/p257_058|It is not great art.
p257/p257_074|It was chaotic.
p257/p257_169|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p257/p257_104|That time is not now, however.
p257/p257_238|They may yet have the last laugh.
p257/p257_231|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p257/p257_414|I have so much respect for him.
p257/p257_094|She told The Herald.
p257/p257_361|He has the edge.
p257/p257_136|They made such decisions in London.
p257/p257_167|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p257/p257_270|It was a privilege to work for him.
p257/p257_032|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p257/p257_129|So the European elections are extremely important.
p257/p257_226|Broke the birdie record.
p257/p257_316|The boat was fantastic.
p335/p335_400|The conclusion is enthralling.
p335/p335_110|Or was it?
p335/p335_172|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p335/p335_245|A friendship that will endure.
p335/p335_398|He became the focus of surrounding interest.
p335/p335_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p335/p335_069|It is a family day out.
p335/p335_126|Pig farmers are completely despondent.
p335/p335_380|Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
p335/p335_151|I'd say we should give it a week.
p335/p335_206|The text is reduced to bubbles.
p335/p335_295|He knew it would cost him millions.
p335/p335_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p335/p335_341|With us, we just want them to respond.
p335/p335_228|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p335/p335_063|I've learned from my mistakes.
p335/p335_209|That has not changed.
p335/p335_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p335/p335_098|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p335/p335_105|Which perhaps is just as well.
p335/p335_147|It was worth a photograph.
p335/p335_208|We don't say there was a massacre.
p335/p335_156|Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
p335/p335_169|Where is the structure?
p335/p335_180|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p335/p335_177|Teams are always interesting to watch.
p335/p335_250|Alex is a big part of that future.
p335/p335_029|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p335/p335_164|I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
p335/p335_346|We have rebuilt and reformed.
p335/p335_086|Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
p335/p335_268|I have good memories of Glasgow.
p335/p335_070|On that basis, he would set it aside.
p335/p335_122|I am not holding the club to ransom.
p335/p335_025|He was born in London of Scottish parents.
p335/p335_224|We have great sympathy with Danny.
p335/p335_375|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p335/p335_183|Whether this return was too soon.
p335/p335_083|We aim to put them out of business.
p335/p335_372|At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
p335/p335_236|I don't have any answer for them.
p335/p335_417|THE pain was almost too much to bear.
p335/p335_234|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p335/p335_337|It is so damaging.
p335/p335_311|Hitches can be expected.
p335/p335_178|Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
p335/p335_376|The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
p335/p335_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p335/p335_391|You do that because you want to win.
p335/p335_412|The game is now open.
p335/p335_058|Let's see that increase over the years.
p335/p335_040|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p335/p335_072|Bin Laden was not mentioned.
p335/p335_342|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p335/p335_297|Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
p335/p335_186|McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
p335/p335_185|He had come of age.
p335/p335_313|The issues are very intense.
p335/p335_047|That, though, is the measure of the man.
p335/p335_384|Scotland is too small a country for that.
p335/p335_246|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p335/p335_353|Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
p335/p335_168|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p335/p335_286|Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
p335/p335_363|It was a job he loved.
p335/p335_290|He did not oppose the divorce.
p335/p335_179|They had been together for about three years.
p335/p335_287|Others were even less confident.
p335/p335_165|That nation is South Africa.
p335/p335_153|There was a lot of resentment.
p335/p335_142|I do not own the vessel in question.
p335/p335_081|That would be dangerous.
p335/p335_121|The final stage is paranoia.
p335/p335_345|The songs are just so good.
p335/p335_395|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p335/p335_036|Pupils and staff were sent home early.
p335/p335_360|There is no openness.
p335/p335_218|It is a court case.
p335/p335_136|Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
p335/p335_377|Only local people are helping.
p335/p335_132|My duty is to win.
p335/p335_198|He added,  It is all about the search for power.
p335/p335_275|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p335/p335_066|It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
p335/p335_348|It was certainly intense.
p335/p335_300|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p335/p335_396|I'll tell you honestly.
p335/p335_282|Arsenal considered the job done.
p335/p335_352|We were a shambles at the back.
p335/p335_079|It plans to return to this field.
p335/p335_227|This is wonderful news.
p335/p335_296|I'd never be free.
p335/p335_418|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p335/p335_289|On occasions he succeeded.
p335/p335_355|There is access for disabled people.
p335/p335_129|A win was a real achievement.
p335/p335_347|Scottish life can be like this, too.
p335/p335_204|She was an only child.
p335/p335_068|I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
p335/p335_325|Stock markets will be watching closely.
p335/p335_262|Intensive care has been very busy.
p335/p335_146|Mummy believed in one thing above all.
p335/p335_042|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p335/p335_394|Partition is not an option.
p335/p335_301|Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
p335/p335_093|We wanted it left for a wee while.
p335/p335_192|That wasn't for me.
p335/p335_298|A counter reaction was.
p335/p335_196|We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
p335/p335_292|There are so many people to thank.
p335/p335_411|He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
p335/p335_099|That is nearly four people every day.
p335/p335_134|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p335/p335_064|This must be wrong.
p335/p335_270|It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
p335/p335_267|We will build upon the basic state pension.
p335/p335_048|On reflection, it is more than that.
p335/p335_174|It was an empowering journey.
p335/p335_323|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p335/p335_166|This will secure the future of our industry.
p335/p335_043|All the oil companies are talking together.
p335/p335_173|He is the example for all of us.
p335/p335_350|He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
p335/p335_338|I put pressure on him.
p335/p335_041|I only half believed it.
p335/p335_229|But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
p335/p335_167|It's just a normal life.
p335/p335_312|He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
p335/p335_222|This fact is supported by audience research.
p335/p335_390|It's really nothing new.
p335/p335_031|It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
p335/p335_102|This would not be my first choice.
p335/p335_026|Her condition last night was described as critical.
p335/p335_329|In Europe, it is always over two games.
p335/p335_150|The pilot was making a visual approach.
p335/p335_162|We've got the top three.
p335/p335_334|However, we had no failures in our side.
p335/p335_087|Correction, knowing him, he might.
p335/p335_310|I am not among its admirers.
p335/p335_258|I watched a game.
p335/p335_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p335/p335_128|It was meant to rival the dollar.
p335/p335_157|It's because they can't understand the language.
p335/p335_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p335/p335_291|Famously, though, there was a catch.
p335/p335_257|That gives us a bit of a chance.
p335/p335_080|He said because people had invited him.
p335/p335_409|We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
p335/p335_327|If they have City backing, what is the influence?
p335/p335_091|The proposal was rejected.
p335/p335_225|Come to that, is any of this really happening?
p335/p335_387|It's our worst nightmare.
p335/p335_117|Police were also perplexed.
p335/p335_217|This doesn't have to be our future.
p335/p335_187|We do things in an appropriate way.
p335/p335_060|These findings would be made public.
p335/p335_381|You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
p335/p335_303|This looks like it is anything but open.
p335/p335_285|The company yesterday refused to comment.
p335/p335_333|There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
p335/p335_148|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p335/p335_239|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p335/p335_320|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p335/p335_399|It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
p335/p335_056|I don't want to hear any excuses.
p335/p335_075|We should do everything at a stroke.
p335/p335_413|Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
p335/p335_317|Dialogue is the key.
p335/p335_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p335/p335_074|The team this year is going places.
p335/p335_404|Friends of the family have given their support.
p335/p335_104|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p335/p335_276|That is highly unfair.
p335/p335_316|The company's in good shape.
p335/p335_144|It's all too short term.
p335/p335_197|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p335/p335_249|Nowadays, it is workers united.
p335/p335_335|I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
p335/p335_322|But he is revelling in the big stage.
p335/p335_382|Writing has diminished in value.
p335/p335_369|This is the last thing we ever expected.
p335/p335_103|We knew nothing about it.
p335/p335_357|All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
p335/p335_143|Racism has no place in any sport.
p335/p335_154|Where is the anthrax?
p335/p335_200|Next time around, it will be different.
p335/p335_097|You can expect a hell of a fuss.
p335/p335_089|We still don't know what's happened.
p335/p335_112|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p335/p335_406|We are obviously disturbed by this case.
p335/p335_265|This is my home town.
p335/p335_321|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p335/p335_261|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p335/p335_076|He had a moustache.
p335/p335_403|Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
p335/p335_101|I like what has happened!
p335/p335_373|We were short of athletes.
p335/p335_340|I'm the one who has to suffer.
p335/p335_055|There are schoolboys in uniform.
p335/p335_085|He was extremely nervous.
p335/p335_034|There are some serious ethical issues involved.
p335/p335_182|Children are using books in a terrible condition.
p335/p335_096|I would think they are just behind them.
p335/p335_203|That is a brand name.
p335/p335_364|It may encourage more people to prospect.
p335/p335_199|There we were on the first tee.
p335/p335_306|If not, he should go home.
p335/p335_190|Broomfield was the centre of the town.
p335/p335_231|They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
p335/p335_038|Who does he think will win?
p335/p335_145|It's too big a risk to take.
p335/p335_030|They tend to be easily influenced by others.
p335/p335_235|This is a big step up.
p335/p335_315|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p335/p335_061|It's the most beautiful place on earth.
p335/p335_263|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p335/p335_271|Some may end up in hospital.
p335/p335_053|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p335/p335_336|We will be stronger in Berlin.
p335/p335_207|They should come forward.
p335/p335_046|Rangers deserved to beat us.
p335/p335_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p335/p335_226|Both sides have to step back.
p335/p335_356|The home was now under new management.
p335/p335_212|We are not ruling it out.
p335/p335_330|The whole thing would be perfect.
p335/p335_266|I think we've got the balance right.
p335/p335_138|This is not presently the case.
p335/p335_378|There were three boys and two girls.
p335/p335_067|I go home only once.
p335/p335_344|They are the heroes.
p335/p335_131|That's the sort of game you want.
p335/p335_302|This will help our confidence.
p335/p335_100|There are nine people here now.
p335/p335_374|Six other people were injured.
p335/p335_281|Government sources said, It is building up.
p335/p335_114|The dealer is on notice.
p335/p335_274|We can do nothing about that.
p335/p335_419|He is not very big, either.
p335/p335_402|The review has been conducted fairly.
p335/p335_170|Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
p335/p335_422|We are encouraged by the news.
p335/p335_331|There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
p335/p335_033|But she was very human.
p335/p335_272|He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
p335/p335_359|It is like a theatre of the absurd.
p335/p335_233|We are ready for the long haul.
p335/p335_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p335/p335_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p335/p335_008|These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p335/p335_349|It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
p335/p335_220|They will have to make changes.
p335/p335_071|I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
p335/p335_415|I am in a very difficult position.
p335/p335_254|Finally action had been taken.
p335/p335_219|She was a delightful person.
p335/p335_264|I try not to expect anything.
p335/p335_065|He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
p335/p335_188|We just want to get stuck in now.
p335/p335_389|It's about my time as a guitarist.
p335/p335_035|If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
p335/p335_405|You name it, they have it.
p335/p335_181|Our customers come first.
p335/p335_171|There's still time for that.
p335/p335_050|But he just carried on anyway.
p335/p335_215|Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
p335/p335_278|I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
p335/p335_243|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p335/p335_354|It took more than two years.
p335/p335_133|Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
p335/p335_045|The prognosis is excellent.
p335/p335_113|Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
p335/p335_416|They will run in tandem with New Work.
p335/p335_195|The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
p335/p335_176|Laura is an investment banker.
p335/p335_084|They're completely different from each other.
p335/p335_125|We represent a wide range of society.
p335/p335_252|I think he was surprised.
p335/p335_027|I believe in the Church.
p335/p335_277|There is great demand for human cloning.
p335/p335_130|This is the high point of my career.
p335/p335_028|Let's not go overboard.
p335/p335_240|EMI is a prime example.
p335/p335_361|It's being very carefully looked at.
p335/p335_247|It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
p335/p335_094|Four other charges were dropped.
p335/p335_414|Jackson may well be right.
p335/p335_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p335/p335_232|It sounds a bit of an own goal.
p335/p335_366|There was some merit in that.
p335/p335_386|Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
p335/p335_324|You have to think not.
p335/p335_107|They receive a high profile in the media.
p335/p335_368|Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
p335/p335_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p335/p335_253|I played well on Saturday and again today.
p335/p335_213|You saw the pain he was in.
p335/p335_256|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p335/p335_423|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p335/p335_393|From then on, Scott has never looked back.
p335/p335_159|He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
p335/p335_210|John Lennon is a very large industry.
p335/p335_223|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p335/p335_090|His team management was protective.
p335/p335_141|We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
p335/p335_108|They have got their position, we have got our position.
p335/p335_175|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p335/p335_305|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p335/p335_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p335/p335_367|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p335/p335_241|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p335/p335_248|I am deeply sorry they did.
p335/p335_127|I've seen some of the submissions.
p335/p335_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p335/p335_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p335/p335_328|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p335/p335_371|This means a great deal to the families.
p335/p335_293|Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
p335/p335_288|I just want to change my life.
p335/p335_160|This is good news for the Western Isles.
p335/p335_051|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p335/p335_309|Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
p335/p335_052|I would not want to be young again.
p335/p335_088|I came up through the ranks.
p335/p335_260|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p335/p335_370|It looks like paradise.
p335/p335_237|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p335/p335_385|I am not obsessed with sex.
p335/p335_032|Well, what do you know?
p335/p335_362|It feels like too much.
p335/p335_283|I think it will make a huge difference.
p335/p335_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p335/p335_049|It is not normal practice.
p335/p335_392|We have been working closely with Holyrood.
p335/p335_118|For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
p335/p335_259|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p335/p335_294|He is also a great finisher.
p335/p335_242|You cannot allow it to go on.
p335/p335_082|Its workforce is to be made redundant.
p335/p335_057|They were later discharged from hospital.
p335/p335_001|Please call Stella.
p335/p335_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p335/p335_039|He will emerge as a world leader.
p335/p335_044|The failings are serious.
p335/p335_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p335/p335_135|These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
p335/p335_155|I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
p335/p335_149|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p335/p335_280|Scots actors should be so lucky.
p335/p335_314|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p335/p335_216|Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
p335/p335_111|It is not fair.
p335/p335_379|There's no support for it at all.
p335/p335_205|It is best value.
p335/p335_211|The island will never recover.
p335/p335_326|This is a national crisis.
p335/p335_191|It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
p335/p335_251|Who would have thought it?
p335/p335_244|Not that Agassi was a believer.
p335/p335_273|The council has been open and transparent.
p335/p335_095|These guys will not lie down.
p335/p335_137|I am prepared to help make it happen.
p335/p335_139|It was a moment of madness.
p335/p335_420|Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
p335/p335_214|That is not an easy thing.
p335/p335_304|We are now setting about finding them.
p335/p335_279|Or rather he did and he didn't.
p335/p335_408|There is no going back.
p335/p335_332|As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
p335/p335_059|I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
p335/p335_163|But the price has been very high.
p335/p335_161|It's been a good year.
p335/p335_383|There is a job to be done.
p335/p335_343|And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
p335/p335_358|Is my wife a racist?
p335/p335_120|JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
p335/p335_308|It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
p335/p335_073|Seven people were later detained by police.
p335/p335_410|Courtenay took over on tour.
p335/p335_299|He said he was sorry.
p335/p335_123|Wagner was never like this.
p335/p335_194|We are aware of the tribunal case.
p335/p335_284|Bob Dylan is getting old.
p335/p335_092|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p335/p335_078|History is usually written by the victors.
p335/p335_238|I look for dancers who are also actors.
p335/p335_401|This is usually done by the space shuttle.
p335/p335_116|We kept going right to the final whistle.
p335/p335_037|There were no proposals on the table.
p335/p335_106|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p335/p335_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p335/p335_202|I looked forward to it.
p335/p335_230|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p335/p335_124|The plane was in flames
p335/p335_269|Nothing can bring back their son.
p335/p335_339|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p335/p335_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p335/p335_307|We must not go down that road.
p335/p335_158|That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p335/p335_062|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p335/p335_421|But who gets on the tube?
p335/p335_221|The next one comes up.
p335/p335_193|I am delighted with today's win.
p335/p335_109|There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
p335/p335_189|Do you come from Moscow?
p335/p335_115|But it will backfire.
p335/p335_201|Broke the birdie record.
p335/p335_152|The elections should have no role in this.
p335/p335_351|He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
p335/p335_077|It's just for me.
p335/p335_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p335/p335_388|I can't believe what has happened.
p335/p335_397|The home team had an amazing start.
p335/p335_140|Don't even bother applying.
p335/p335_119|Britain may now be forced to listen.
p335/p335_407|There was no cohesion.
p335/p335_318|The actors are confident and polished.
p335/p335_184|We didn't think anything would happen.
p335/p335_319|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p335/p335_255|Then there's the problem of sympathy.
p335/p335_054|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p335/p335_365|But let's not get carried away.
p272/p272_269|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p272/p272_226|There is no excuse.
p272/p272_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p272/p272_318|I was invited to work in Germany.
p272/p272_062|There was no safety net.
p272/p272_368|He was the architect.
p272/p272_096|They lived for their children.
p272/p272_148|The role of the law lords would be retained.
p272/p272_253|Blood samples were taken.
p272/p272_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p272/p272_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p272/p272_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p272/p272_255|We shall rely on human beings.
p272/p272_242|I can't get a job.
p272/p272_158|We are on a four-year mission.
p272/p272_327|Two people were interviewed.
p272/p272_232|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p272/p272_176|Tony had arrived.
p272/p272_324|It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
p272/p272_054|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p272/p272_069|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p272/p272_295|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p272/p272_394|It was a kind of contempt.
p272/p272_189|It's a fact.
p272/p272_111|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p272/p272_112|Two of the team became ill.
p272/p272_037|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p272/p272_187|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p272/p272_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p272/p272_166|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p272/p272_309|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p272/p272_100|I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
p272/p272_120|It is so sad.
p272/p272_169|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p272/p272_191|We believe a third party was involved.
p272/p272_230|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p272/p272_372|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p272/p272_030|There's a story, too.
p272/p272_034|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p272/p272_101|It was clear.
p272/p272_127|I can't even get into the A team.
p272/p272_374|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p272/p272_339|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p272/p272_307|It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
p272/p272_352|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p272/p272_325|Well, it won't.
p272/p272_395|It was a breathtaking moment.
p272/p272_323|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p272/p272_294|One was a lawyer.
p272/p272_351|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p272/p272_397|It will take place in July.
p272/p272_375|Something is wrong.
p272/p272_350|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p272/p272_098|Today I couldn't run on it.
p272/p272_240|There's the mix.
p272/p272_212|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p272/p272_149|It is not just about pay.
p272/p272_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p272/p272_131|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p272/p272_123|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p272/p272_196|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p272/p272_177|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p272/p272_243|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p272/p272_132|No production was achieved.
p272/p272_298|The plot is minimal.
p272/p272_248|Is that a serious question?
p272/p272_402|Emotions were complex.
p272/p272_302|We want to play at the worlds.
p272/p272_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p272/p272_103|But I was wrong.
p272/p272_282|It was good.
p272/p272_349|We will be homeless.
p272/p272_139|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p272/p272_033|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p272/p272_356|Four policemen were wounded.
p272/p272_358|It's now down in black and white.
p272/p272_387|I was in the train station overnight.
p272/p272_207|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p272/p272_409|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p272/p272_085|Even the one she loved.
p272/p272_144|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p272/p272_188|Peace was won.
p272/p272_152|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p272/p272_095|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p272/p272_133|The BBC was a disgrace.
p272/p272_185|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p272/p272_134|This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
p272/p272_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p272/p272_056|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p272/p272_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p272/p272_076|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p272/p272_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p272/p272_360|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p272/p272_046|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
p272/p272_138|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p272/p272_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p272/p272_244|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p272/p272_164|I will tell you.
p272/p272_389|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p272/p272_284|Bombing slaughter rejected
p272/p272_179|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p272/p272_090|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p272/p272_285|The songs are just so good.
p272/p272_213|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p272/p272_201|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p272/p272_038|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p272/p272_270|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p272/p272_367|It was a funny game.
p272/p272_259|It's very nice.
p272/p272_335|He loves the big occasions.
p272/p272_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p272/p272_229|But it's a subtle process.
p272/p272_074|But I've won both ways.
p272/p272_407|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p272/p272_128|I'm so angry.
p272/p272_031|This is the window.
p272/p272_310|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p272/p272_107|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p272/p272_245|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p272/p272_116|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p272/p272_186|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p272/p272_200|Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
p272/p272_311|A review is under way.
p272/p272_136|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p272/p272_079|I had my suspicions.
p272/p272_168|We've all had the shots.
p272/p272_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p272/p272_332|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p272/p272_180|They need to look after themselves.
p272/p272_219|At the time, he was a living legend.
p272/p272_058|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p272/p272_050|This represents a tough game for us.
p272/p272_040|They're just different.
p272/p272_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p272/p272_051|It is bizarre.
p272/p272_357|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p272/p272_114|She reflects a bit.
p272/p272_257|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p272/p272_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p272/p272_254|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p272/p272_251|Souter will be back.
p272/p272_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p272/p272_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p272/p272_281|This is a national crisis.
p272/p272_217|But she was.
p272/p272_142|We want to keep the pound.
p272/p272_321|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p272/p272_202|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p272/p272_237|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p272/p272_308|My body is clearly capable.
p272/p272_246|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p272/p272_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p272/p272_233|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p272/p272_272|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p272/p272_047|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p272/p272_195|But she might be.
p272/p272_369|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p272/p272_026|Is this accurate?
p272/p272_071|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p272/p272_199|We have an election in eight days.
p272/p272_278|It was a virus.
p272/p272_043|Indeed, he does.
p272/p272_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p272/p272_326|These days are long gone.
p272/p272_393|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p272/p272_151|So I got a blood test.
p272/p272_065|They are ready.
p272/p272_337|That has been lost.
p272/p272_205|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p272/p272_070|They are real.
p272/p272_167|It is not like us.
p272/p272_314|It's too horrible to think.
p272/p272_279|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p272/p272_117|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p272/p272_297|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p272/p272_288|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p272/p272_045|He's just in it for himself.
p272/p272_312|It will work.
p272/p272_215|It's not before time.
p272/p272_211|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p272/p272_129|She really suffered for her art.
p272/p272_290|What has altered?
p272/p272_092|By then, he was walking on water.
p272/p272_359|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p272/p272_385|It's a real problem.
p272/p272_053|Is a drug dealer?
p272/p272_316|Off with their heads.
p272/p272_236|The scene is about this?
p272/p272_190|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p272/p272_396|The car was just there.
p272/p272_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p272/p272_154|I was so nervous.
p272/p272_115|I am just trying to do my job.
p272/p272_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p272/p272_410|Feel the air, the space.
p272/p272_052|They said she was stable.
p272/p272_347|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p272/p272_048|We will push.
p272/p272_271|If not, he should go home.
p272/p272_273|He looked very sharp.
p272/p272_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p272/p272_157|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p272/p272_406|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p272/p272_135|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p272/p272_192|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p272/p272_162|Well, he should know.
p272/p272_049|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p272/p272_204|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p272/p272_061|Next league matches Celtic.
p272/p272_194|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p272/p272_178|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p272/p272_235|Our policy is clear.
p272/p272_137|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p272/p272_344|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p272/p272_099|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p272/p272_119|Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
p272/p272_305|We are a peaceful people.
p272/p272_203|Twaddle is a case in point.
p272/p272_170|Again, we were lucky.
p272/p272_084|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p272/p272_401|What was the difference between them?
p272/p272_125|Who would have?
p272/p272_252|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p272/p272_345|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p272/p272_275|All options are open.
p272/p272_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p272/p272_218|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p272/p272_317|Is there a new way forward?
p272/p272_268|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p272/p272_320|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p272/p272_366|There is no signature.
p272/p272_118|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p272/p272_234|It is hard won.
p272/p272_044|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p272/p272_221|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p272/p272_091|Someone who cares
p272/p272_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p272/p272_403|Then , he laughs.
p272/p272_399|Is that possible?
p272/p272_094|It is a blow.
p272/p272_078|Painful, but only because it's true.
p272/p272_256|This is a question of Islam.
p272/p272_373|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p272/p272_388|It is unusual.
p272/p272_262|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p272/p272_329|The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
p272/p272_265|It's a way of life.
p272/p272_087|He is in the queue.
p272/p272_343|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p272/p272_306|You may have a short memory.
p272/p272_029|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p272/p272_404|Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
p272/p272_292|Nothing is safe.
p272/p272_303|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p272/p272_386|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p272/p272_371|I am a wealthy person.
p272/p272_175|As we worked.
p272/p272_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p272/p272_378|That's the name of the game, though.
p272/p272_093|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p272/p272_227|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p272/p272_247|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p272/p272_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p272/p272_392|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p272/p272_216|The report is due out next month.
p272/p272_220|They must do it.
p272/p272_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p272/p272_289|I was the sheep.
p272/p272_238|There wasn't a goal.
p272/p272_081|It was magic.
p272/p272_353|There was a substantial explosion.
p272/p272_223|Until they came to do it.
p272/p272_370|I've never seen a game like it.
p272/p272_140|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p272/p272_088|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p272/p272_382|At the last I found a bunker.
p272/p272_301|The letters are going out today.
p272/p272_035|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p272/p272_171|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p272/p272_108|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
p272/p272_296|They are wrong.
p272/p272_390|It's like a basketball.
p272/p272_068|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p272/p272_145|Who would be right?
p272/p272_184|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p272/p272_143|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p272/p272_160|My Dad is a hero.
p272/p272_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p272/p272_328|I've got no secret.
p272/p272_398|The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
p272/p272_206|In each case they were a goal down.
p272/p272_263|We're in shock.
p272/p272_161|He can do no wrong.
p272/p272_121|The mood is upbeat.
p272/p272_391|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p272/p272_319|Is that an issue?
p272/p272_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p272/p272_109|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p272/p272_102|It is annoying.
p272/p272_331|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p272/p272_405|It is an absolute nonsense.
p272/p272_209|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p272/p272_097|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p272/p272_342|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p272/p272_361|They have not done so this season so far.
p272/p272_280|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p272/p272_313|I came into this world with nothing.
p272/p272_224|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p272/p272_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p272/p272_379|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p272/p272_330|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p272/p272_381|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p272/p272_264|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p272/p272_336|The performance was excellent.
p272/p272_163|It is so unfair.
p272/p272_267|It was very fast.
p272/p272_067|I feel I did not have enough time.
p272/p272_025|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p272/p272_193|Tommy is not a problem.
p272/p272_060|It had been in place since last July.
p272/p272_055|He is too weak to move.
p272/p272_059|Here's a clue.
p272/p272_340|She said they would appeal.
p272/p272_261|The system can work.
p272/p272_064|That's the truth.
p272/p272_075|There was an e-mail.
p272/p272_086|Today she has been released.
p272/p272_066|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p272/p272_231|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p272/p272_041|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p272/p272_210|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p272/p272_156|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p272/p272_089|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p272/p272_239|I should think so, too.
p272/p272_197|It was worth a photograph.
p272/p272_113|He takes the job.
p272/p272_182|What has caused the demise of singing?
p272/p272_277|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p272/p272_153|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p272/p272_300|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p272/p272_214|You should always be able to get out in some direction.
p272/p272_141|I had decided to quit the show.
p272/p272_283|Who did the recruiting?
p272/p272_411|He got his degree.
p272/p272_315|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p272/p272_106|Our position remains unchanged.
p272/p272_266|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p272/p272_073|He was popular.
p272/p272_173|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p272/p272_032|He was jailed for five years.
p272/p272_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p272/p272_355|He could make it.
p272/p272_181|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p272/p272_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p272/p272_147|He realises his mistake.
p272/p272_155|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p272/p272_384|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p272/p272_287|There's a pause.
p272/p272_146|She died at her home.
p272/p272_027|They have no history.
p272/p272_304|My whole life has changed.
p272/p272_408|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p272/p272_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p272/p272_072|That was a gold medal for certain.
p272/p272_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p272/p272_364|So there, we won.
p272/p272_042|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p272/p272_346|As, indeed, they would be.
p272/p272_322|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p272/p272_124|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p272/p272_150|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p272/p272_183|Our team is just so young.
p272/p272_104|I love the Dome.
p272/p272_228|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p272/p272_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p272/p272_341|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p272/p272_159|They should come clean.
p272/p272_376|You can cope with it.
p272/p272_110|You should be.
p272/p272_105|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p272/p272_258|Immediate action must be taken.
p272/p272_380|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p272/p272_077|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p272/p272_260|He was also married with two children.
p272/p272_225|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p272/p272_198|They make a selective perception process.
p272/p272_249|This is the first step.
p272/p272_354|Not so, it seems.
p272/p272_276|Dialogue is the key.
p272/p272_338|Tell us about it.
p272/p272_250|They must play for each other.
p272/p272_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p272/p272_299|You are the glory.
p272/p272_063|It is unique.
p272/p272_080|He was at home with his pals.
p272/p272_172|Does that put pressure on us?
p272/p272_274|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p272/p272_039|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p272/p272_291|I was brought up in a mining background.
p272/p272_222|However, no further action was taken by police.
p272/p272_083|It is a job creation scheme.
p272/p272_383|Yet the data is compelling.
p272/p272_377|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p272/p272_057|He looks like an Afghan.
p272/p272_286|The goals will come.
p272/p272_241|The concerns are the same.
p272/p272_293|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p272/p272_412|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p272/p272_122|It is rubbish.
p272/p272_036|Was it worth it?
p272/p272_082|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p259/p259_430|The next few months will tell.
p259/p259_032|The function of the clerk is to provide advice.
p259/p259_403|It would be quite nice.
p259/p259_387|He had no previous convictions.
p259/p259_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p259/p259_402|They were to blame for the first two goals.
p259/p259_405|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p259/p259_259|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p259/p259_312|It seemed a logical expansion.
p259/p259_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p259/p259_077|I wanted to change the formula.
p259/p259_057|Let's hope that it does.
p259/p259_286|You have got the evidence.
p259/p259_337|What do they want us to do?
p259/p259_041|It carried a double message.
p259/p259_225|I won't make an official complaint.
p259/p259_243|The transaction is not feasible.
p259/p259_409|Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
p259/p259_378|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p259/p259_331|Are they free?
p259/p259_059|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p259/p259_071|Today it was really enjoyable.
p259/p259_339|His appeal is instantly understood.
p259/p259_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p259/p259_477|The price paid for it was not disclosed.
p259/p259_389|They should take their mobile phones.
p259/p259_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p259/p259_266|Do you think we are a top nation?
p259/p259_413|The director will be present.
p259/p259_396|That is a crazy situation.
p259/p259_234|I am delighted for Simon.
p259/p259_320|Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
p259/p259_264|Does that put pressure on us?
p259/p259_078|It gave no further details.
p259/p259_369|They promised to fight the plans.
p259/p259_476|He deserved a red card.
p259/p259_030|I could not do it.
p259/p259_362|A Home Office spokesman said.
p259/p259_462|We put our bid in last night.
p259/p259_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p259/p259_374|Finally came the moment of truth.
p259/p259_279|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p259/p259_181|Phase one was a shambles.
p259/p259_335|So what happens next?
p259/p259_294|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p259/p259_135|Reaction to the device was mixed.
p259/p259_451|I never found my rhythm.
p259/p259_189|Our destiny is in our own hands.
p259/p259_465|But we have built a platform for next season.
p259/p259_463|Quality was high in all sections.
p259/p259_262|I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.
p259/p259_034|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p259/p259_069|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p259/p259_376|Neither man has been charged.
p259/p259_275|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p259/p259_250|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p259/p259_146|What do we want to do that for?
p259/p259_385|I've always been a sensitive.
p259/p259_235|It had all been arranged.
p259/p259_061|The Farmer wants a new campaign.
p259/p259_277|You can feel at home in China.
p259/p259_325|We would hope to make progress on that next year.
p259/p259_429|The casualties were not named.
p259/p259_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p259/p259_455|Nobody has told the story.
p259/p259_198|Shelter also supports the reform.
p259/p259_173|We have a budget in March.
p259/p259_471|Let that be their memorial.
p259/p259_280|No date has been fixed for his return.
p259/p259_052|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p259/p259_058|We have to keep our clients.
p259/p259_445|Such an attack is bizarre.
p259/p259_359|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p259/p259_433|Three years ago he would have been.
p259/p259_246|Things were so intense in the studio.
p259/p259_317|This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.
p259/p259_352|There will be good prospects ahead.
p259/p259_366|Industrial action has to hurt.
p259/p259_310|I understand the security issue.
p259/p259_090|Why do it otherwise?
p259/p259_027|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p259/p259_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p259/p259_379|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p259/p259_342|This will save interest charges.
p259/p259_322|We will deliver at director level.
p259/p259_318|It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
p259/p259_149|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p259/p259_134|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p259/p259_344|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p259/p259_326|Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
p259/p259_301|This could put pressure on UK inflation.
p259/p259_025|But it could prove disastrous.
p259/p259_208|He was then replaced by Ross.
p259/p259_252|Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
p259/p259_439|There is a solution, she believes.
p259/p259_293|I'd never run for them.
p259/p259_152|He was seen as the enemy.
p259/p259_355|We want to play at the worlds.
p259/p259_247|We will reform the welfare state.
p259/p259_425|It is hard to understand.
p259/p259_356|Other people had looked at it.
p259/p259_068|It is a job creation scheme.
p259/p259_207|He should emerge as the winner.
p259/p259_220|The result is utterly compelling.
p259/p259_051|I had trouble with the producers.
p259/p259_295|They must play for each other.
p259/p259_328|And that culture is everywhere In Dublin.
p259/p259_168|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p259/p259_479|Some problems were too complex.
p259/p259_028|I am pretty careful with money.
p259/p259_132|I am totally devoted to this job.
p259/p259_084|It is normal for me.
p259/p259_382|He is an excellent manager.
p259/p259_223|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p259/p259_291|He took over our lives.
p259/p259_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p259/p259_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p259/p259_323|We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
p259/p259_411|The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
p259/p259_086|How are you, sir?
p259/p259_347|Job losses were also announced.
p259/p259_244|People should make their own decisions.
p259/p259_098|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p259/p259_414|It is the nature of his party.
p259/p259_481|The chief constable has retired.
p259/p259_426|But the foundations have been laid.
p259/p259_218|Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
p259/p259_239|They are difficult awards to decide.
p259/p259_354|He will go a long way.
p259/p259_118|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p259/p259_035|Because he was born in England.
p259/p259_031|Everyone can have their opinion.
p259/p259_418|My view has now completely changed.
p259/p259_306|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p259/p259_268|How independent is that?
p259/p259_415|Theatre is not a museum.
p259/p259_372|He was at school in Devon.
p259/p259_050|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p259/p259_140|I'm so grateful for that.
p259/p259_392|Does it matter?
p259/p259_272|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p259/p259_422|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p259/p259_055|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p259/p259_383|I think we'll just keep it.
p259/p259_227|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p259/p259_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p259/p259_095|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p259/p259_224|Little is known about them.
p259/p259_115|New Year will be very busy.
p259/p259_163|The weather forecast isn't good.
p259/p259_390|Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
p259/p259_229|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p259/p259_201|It caused a lot of upset.
p259/p259_064|It wasn't possible to relax.
p259/p259_452|In fact, the reasons are simple.
p259/p259_105|But they must believe in themselves.
p259/p259_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p259/p259_099|He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
p259/p259_330|No Briton has ever won.
p259/p259_039|I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
p259/p259_001|Please call Stella.
p259/p259_423|I've had a wonderful career.
p259/p259_200|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p259/p259_298|It is also very valuable.
p259/p259_195|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p259/p259_303|We're trying to get rounded performers.
p259/p259_113|He was jailed for a year.
p259/p259_101|I did not have a bet on myself.
p259/p259_363|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p259/p259_040|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p259/p259_193|You know the sort of thing.
p259/p259_332|What are they for?
p259/p259_085|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p259/p259_107|The following are the principal provisions.
p259/p259_292|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p259/p259_338|Is it worth it?
p259/p259_281|We will listen to any suggestion.
p259/p259_345|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p259/p259_271|He said the right things.
p259/p259_038|It all started with a visiting rugby club.
p259/p259_177|The people are the hero.
p259/p259_179|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p259/p259_079|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p259/p259_147|Does the name matter?
p259/p259_311|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p259/p259_056|They had been in Scotland on exercise.
p259/p259_447|I never had a childhood.
p259/p259_210|was everything done to save people?
p259/p259_074|It makes for an interesting conference.
p259/p259_154|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p259/p259_042|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p259/p259_327|I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
p259/p259_117|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p259/p259_111|Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
p259/p259_435|I watch the other visitors.
p259/p259_148|how do you get it back?
p259/p259_182|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p259/p259_370|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p259/p259_289|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p259/p259_044|The boy is no longer with us.
p259/p259_036|They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
p259/p259_092|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p259/p259_341|The songs are just so good.
p259/p259_351|Scotland has shown the way.
p259/p259_399|The salary changes are long overdue.
p259/p259_278|I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
p259/p259_315|It's hard to see it.
p259/p259_381|But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
p259/p259_401|She said they would appeal.
p259/p259_448|No-one wanted to run it tonight.
p259/p259_153|That group reported just before Christmas.
p259/p259_094|Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.
p259/p259_209|And they were being paid?
p259/p259_375|Whether this return was too soon.
p259/p259_428|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p259/p259_299|There's not much money in cycling.
p259/p259_265|Did it work?
p259/p259_377|An alternative must be offered.
p259/p259_228|We have an election in eight days.
p259/p259_461|It certainly appeared that way.
p259/p259_176|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p259/p259_133|Before it was an ordeal.
p259/p259_156|So I got a blood test.
p259/p259_380|He can handle it without any problem.
p259/p259_091|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p259/p259_114|The whole thing is the music.
p259/p259_296|These figures are truly terrible.
p259/p259_261|Italy is a beautiful place.
p259/p259_088|Do I have a favourite?
p259/p259_446|If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
p259/p259_232|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p259/p259_219|The early physical reports were clear.
p259/p259_197|I'm interested in interesting work.
p259/p259_205|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p259/p259_364|It's too horrible to think.
p259/p259_270|He was good, but not that good.
p259/p259_357|The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
p259/p259_406|The parties include the Scottish Executive.
p259/p259_314|It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
p259/p259_112|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p259/p259_245|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p259/p259_204|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p259/p259_217|This will be our new beginning.
p259/p259_231|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p259/p259_131|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p259/p259_329|I was just so determined.
p259/p259_083|William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
p259/p259_241|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p259/p259_395|After the match, do you?
p259/p259_062|He hadn't had them for a long time.
p259/p259_203|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p259/p259_139|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p259/p259_470|They were good years for him.
p259/p259_456|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p259/p259_037|Child benefit will not be affected.
p259/p259_065|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
p259/p259_144|Was it the wife?
p259/p259_053|We have not given up hope.
p259/p259_166|It was by the numbers.
p259/p259_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p259/p259_226|It was worth a photograph.
p259/p259_216|Here the picture is broadly stable.
p259/p259_236|My daughter is an adult.
p259/p259_070|Even the one she loved.
p259/p259_142|What happened in that game?
p259/p259_417|It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
p259/p259_256|It had so much to do with output.
p259/p259_307|We have a high quality product.
p259/p259_394|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p259/p259_076|I first met him last summer.
p259/p259_194|I cannot say too much about them.
p259/p259_365|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
p259/p259_248|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p259/p259_348|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p259/p259_350|The pound has also suffered.
p259/p259_102|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p259/p259_171|It's never great to finish second.
p259/p259_305|We shall rely on human beings.
p259/p259_343|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p259/p259_170|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p259/p259_119|We have the mental strength.
p259/p259_459|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p259/p259_437|Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
p259/p259_238|It was finally agreed on Saturday.
p259/p259_249|It's easy to be negative about these things.
p259/p259_469|It was like someone had died.
p259/p259_285|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p259/p259_127|But it is different in different regions.
p259/p259_273|I have received no explanation.
p259/p259_408|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p259/p259_230|January is a bad time of year.
p259/p259_125|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p259/p259_128|They made such decisions in London.
p259/p259_063|Only water is currently allowed.
p259/p259_368|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p259/p259_093|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p259/p259_043|Several investments have already been made.
p259/p259_029|He has the courage of the unaware.
p259/p259_460|It is pretty bad news.
p259/p259_150|The referee faces a massive job.
p259/p259_287|We accept the new rules.
p259/p259_404|This remains the party's policy.
p259/p259_120|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p259/p259_240|I am considered a teenager.
p259/p259_410|The team hadn't been picked.
p259/p259_255|We will try to find someone.
p259/p259_116|The result is a vacuum.
p259/p259_367|Nobody said it was required.
p259/p259_165|Behind him was his brother.
p259/p259_222|This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
p259/p259_361|Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
p259/p259_473|I'm very passionate about my country.
p259/p259_157|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p259/p259_432|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p259/p259_319|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p259/p259_373|Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
p259/p259_257|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p259/p259_427|There was an element of frustration.
p259/p259_440|His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
p259/p259_033|We speak about the performance.
p259/p259_167|The woman was his wife.
p259/p259_480|Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
p259/p259_242|He must get to know himself.
p259/p259_126|We did what we had to do.
p259/p259_282|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p259/p259_360|You may have a short memory.
p259/p259_388|It was a massive error of judgment.
p259/p259_284|It makes no difference to their friendship.
p259/p259_159|The two companies were not for sale.
p259/p259_060|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p259/p259_191|We've just had it confirmed.
p259/p259_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p259/p259_340|The results are sometimes contentious.
p259/p259_400|The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
p259/p259_398|The principle is quite clear.
p259/p259_081|Potions said he would drive.
p259/p259_450|There is another important factor.
p259/p259_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p259/p259_386|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p259/p259_202|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p259/p259_184|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p259/p259_474|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p259/p259_472|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p259/p259_046|Merger would be entirely logical.
p259/p259_180|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
p259/p259_087|So is that it, then?
p259/p259_129|Tiger is not the norm.
p259/p259_185|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p259/p259_431|It is not over by any means.
p259/p259_110|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p259/p259_283|I should think so, too.
p259/p259_214|Did he trip?
p259/p259_089|What do we do?
p259/p259_441|It was submitted without their knowledge.
p259/p259_313|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p259/p259_206|In due course we will make an announcement.
p259/p259_346|McNaughton was not so sure.
p259/p259_122|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p259/p259_161|We have to speed up the process.
p259/p259_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p259/p259_267|Is our children learning?
p259/p259_045|Among them are many criminals.
p259/p259_233|From there, they can go anywhere.
p259/p259_358|I didn't have the reply.
p259/p259_158|I haven't made any definite decisions.
p259/p259_336|Had this been common practice?
p259/p259_196|It shows the strength of the roots.
p259/p259_124|It is too pretty, it is too small.
p259/p259_458|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p259/p259_436|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p259/p259_442|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p259/p259_309|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p259/p259_160|People were actually not on his side.
p259/p259_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p259/p259_212|Do I think about them often?
p259/p259_048|They had to explain it.
p259/p259_304|They can leave at any time.
p259/p259_141|But she was very human.
p259/p259_397|We are really good friends.
p259/p259_130|It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.
p259/p259_187|It is only the beginning.
p259/p259_478|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p259/p259_453|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p259/p259_434|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p259/p259_444|It means an enormous amount.
p259/p259_136|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p259/p259_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p259/p259_258|I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
p259/p259_468|She came to the Highland Show.
p259/p259_108|It is a good lifestyle.
p259/p259_467|They offer a kind of narrative.
p259/p259_143|Are you going to win?
p259/p259_199|We represent a wide range of society.
p259/p259_164|Nothing was meant by it.
p259/p259_155|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p259/p259_391|They have broken that promise.
p259/p259_080|Our mother is very worried.
p259/p259_073|It was a unanimous decision.
p259/p259_096|We would have concerns about that.
p259/p259_416|We have very limited capacity.
p259/p259_075|I've had it for the exams.
p259/p259_175|US is the only country to vote against resolution.
p259/p259_353|We think the timing is good.
p259/p259_082|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p259/p259_138|Scotland will finish the group in second place.
p259/p259_097|Ferguson must take the blame.
p259/p259_186|Each case is treated on merit.
p259/p259_412|It sounds like a wish list.
p259/p259_251|The scientific debate is dead.
p259/p259_178|I always felt they played for me.
p259/p259_419|I had a fortunate war.
p259/p259_308|Blair also had a penalty.
p259/p259_302|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p259/p259_174|Adventure is the champagne of life.
p259/p259_276|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p259/p259_104|They will remember this victory for a while.
p259/p259_384|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p259/p259_100|It was clear on Thursday.
p259/p259_449|None of the pieces was commissioned.
p259/p259_464|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
p259/p259_121|That admission is not surprising.
p259/p259_188|He played it like a veteran.
p259/p259_371|He was unable to come.
p259/p259_269|What form did that take?
p259/p259_215|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p259/p259_192|I will have to order its destruction.
p259/p259_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p259/p259_183|It is vital to clarify their role.
p259/p259_047|He looks like an Afghan.
p259/p259_424|The BBC was a disgrace.
p259/p259_420|It's too close to call.
p259/p259_457|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
p259/p259_475|There was no trouble at all.
p259/p259_103|It's good to have a voice.
p259/p259_260|It will now be revived.
p259/p259_274|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p259/p259_162|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p259/p259_254|The body follows the mind.
p259/p259_221|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p259/p259_290|Blair is very positive at European Councils.
p259/p259_066|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
p259/p259_321|The circumstances have changed since last year.
p259/p259_049|I had come back from London.
p259/p259_109|We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
p259/p259_123|We had another last Tuesday.
p259/p259_454|It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
p259/p259_172|You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
p259/p259_145|Why change it?
p259/p259_190|That's not fair to the supporters.
p259/p259_324|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p259/p259_443|My aim is a top six finish.
p259/p259_169|He was right into football from an early age.
p259/p259_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p259/p259_213|Is it in the right place?
p259/p259_263|I was just a kid.
p259/p259_349|The party lasted all night.
p259/p259_288|It is probably in the culture.
p259/p259_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p259/p259_072|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p259/p259_334|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p259/p259_237|His third goal was superb.
p259/p259_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p259/p259_253|You are like an animal.
p259/p259_466|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p259/p259_026|Smoking is also very important.
p259/p259_137|It was started almost by accident.
p259/p259_106|We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
p259/p259_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p259/p259_211|What was the matter for concern?
p259/p259_151|His second goal was equally impressive.
p259/p259_054|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p259/p259_333|Is there a waiting list?
p259/p259_297|I felt about this big.
p259/p259_067|She died in hospital two hours later.
p259/p259_438|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p259/p259_407|We will win the argument.
p259/p259_300|The stage was set for a showdown.
p259/p259_393|How do you take them away?
p259/p259_316|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p259/p259_421|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p259/p259_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p274/p274_405|The members have voted against it.
p274/p274_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p274/p274_048|Subsidy income will not be affected.
p274/p274_118|This should begin in October.
p274/p274_042|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p274/p274_256|What form did that take?
p274/p274_197|But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
p274/p274_310|The rescue package is public money.
p274/p274_160|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p274/p274_468|It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
p274/p274_453|I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
p274/p274_344|No one wants a dispute.
p274/p274_290|It has the potential to be another North Sea.
p274/p274_434|This is a limited market.
p274/p274_284|My main intention was to write a funny comedy.
p274/p274_412|Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
p274/p274_220|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p274/p274_298|You have to expect this type of thing.
p274/p274_384|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p274/p274_144|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p274/p274_163|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p274/p274_437|The Festival is prepared to help.
p274/p274_108|Here the jury is still out.
p274/p274_025|I can't play the game for them.
p274/p274_301|And we were very lucky.
p274/p274_391|It runs until the beginning of June.
p274/p274_449|It is pretty bad news.
p274/p274_032|Costs have got to be controlled.
p274/p274_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p274/p274_093|It was a family tragedy.
p274/p274_252|Did it work?
p274/p274_202|The early physical reports were clear.
p274/p274_341|Writing has diminished in value.
p274/p274_388|The group will also become an Internet service provider.
p274/p274_127|What do we want to do that for?
p274/p274_091|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p274/p274_343|After some discussion they did.
p274/p274_441|I didn't get to keep it.
p274/p274_208|Which isn't a bad idea.
p274/p274_029|Not if you know the person.
p274/p274_452|But we have built a platform for next season.
p274/p274_205|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p274/p274_148|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p274/p274_082|We have to offer value for money.
p274/p274_223|Laura is an investment banker.
p274/p274_214|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p274/p274_366|Do not forget about Monaco.
p274/p274_128|Does the name matter?
p274/p274_440|The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
p274/p274_104|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p274/p274_133|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p274/p274_268|This will save interest charges.
p274/p274_180|Do I think about them often?
p274/p274_355|Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
p274/p274_152|It was by the numbers.
p274/p274_085|It wasn't possible to relax.
p274/p274_186|They responded well after the run of defeats.
p274/p274_081|It took an option on the process.
p274/p274_360|It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
p274/p274_349|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p274/p274_103|I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
p274/p274_320|Are they free?
p274/p274_445|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p274/p274_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p274/p274_228|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p274/p274_075|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p274/p274_260|Labour was too busy to respond.
p274/p274_394|The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.
p274/p274_241|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p274/p274_259|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p274/p274_415|It's just a training thing.
p274/p274_129|how do you get it back?
p274/p274_166|They had been forced to walk.
p274/p274_304|There's nothing I can say.
p274/p274_071|Why do it otherwise?
p274/p274_136|This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
p274/p274_257|Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
p274/p274_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p274/p274_467|The answer was up there on the stage.
p274/p274_054|There's still plenty time left.
p274/p274_072|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p274/p274_369|I got a yellow card.
p274/p274_397|It's never great to finish second.
p274/p274_325|Had this been common practice?
p274/p274_386|The pair are very much in love.
p274/p274_153|And sooner than we may think.
p274/p274_165|Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
p274/p274_028|This is a central issue.
p274/p274_095|It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.
p274/p274_392|He has earned the right to their respect.
p274/p274_314|His appeal is instantly understood.
p274/p274_027|Drugs are a serious problem.
p274/p274_371|How do you take them away?
p274/p274_278|Quality was high in all sections.
p274/p274_305|Her body was found on Monday morning.
p274/p274_288|They can leave at any time.
p274/p274_185|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p274/p274_381|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
p274/p274_131|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p274/p274_217|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p274/p274_390|Glasgow University declined to comment.
p274/p274_271|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p274/p274_230|The performance continues to improve.
p274/p274_295|This is a great opportunity for us.
p274/p274_292|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p274/p274_263|We have no information on Iraq.
p274/p274_264|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p274/p274_061|Only water is currently allowed.
p274/p274_431|A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
p274/p274_175|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p274/p274_283|There's not much money in cycling.
p274/p274_088|The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
p274/p274_195|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p274/p274_389|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p274/p274_330|We're not an employment agency.
p274/p274_309|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p274/p274_346|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p274/p274_425|The projections are very positive for South Africa.
p274/p274_087|Tony Blair said as little.
p274/p274_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p274/p274_227|We played them off the pitch.
p274/p274_067|How are you, sir?
p274/p274_312|Everything in golf is a balance.
p274/p274_040|Well, he is an artist.
p274/p274_119|I was on a roll.
p274/p274_328|There was no hint of scandal.
p274/p274_161|He was in great spirits.
p274/p274_065|Then followed a bout of flu.
p274/p274_387|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p274/p274_255|How independent is that?
p274/p274_321|What are they for?
p274/p274_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p274/p274_125|Was it the wife?
p274/p274_233|He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
p274/p274_051|The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
p274/p274_113|Structural changes were also required.
p274/p274_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p274/p274_448|The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
p274/p274_224|We have not given up hope.
p274/p274_039|Merger would be entirely logical.
p274/p274_086|This is a complex and detailed report.
p274/p274_457|We're still the only ones in the High Street.
p274/p274_159|Full back was a bit of the unknown.
p274/p274_026|She is employed on short-term contracts.
p274/p274_100|Before the game we went for a pint.
p274/p274_084|They lived for their children.
p274/p274_231|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p274/p274_287|It has raised the profile of Scottish banking.
p274/p274_458|A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
p274/p274_358|Governments will have to respond.
p274/p274_342|That's the way it goes.
p274/p274_396|There was a substantial explosion.
p274/p274_406|It's too close to call.
p274/p274_303|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p274/p274_274|We accept the new rules.
p274/p274_115|However, the problem is the timing.
p274/p274_145|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p274/p274_326|What do they want us to do?
p274/p274_335|He has left the company.
p274/p274_380|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p274/p274_429|I never had a childhood.
p274/p274_285|None of this work is guaranteed.
p274/p274_323|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p274/p274_267|I should think so, too.
p274/p274_357|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p274/p274_174|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p274/p274_122|He said to give a local injection.
p274/p274_074|I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
p274/p274_456|They offer a kind of narrative.
p274/p274_340|This is a historic occasion.
p274/p274_300|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p274/p274_116|Which can happen any time.
p274/p274_213|It's easy to be negative about these things.
p274/p274_351|He declined to comment on possible disposals.
p274/p274_033|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p274/p274_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p274/p274_059|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p274/p274_137|It's going to take some time.
p274/p274_182|Did he trip?
p274/p274_035|This represents a tough game for us.
p274/p274_297|It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
p274/p274_276|I couldn't honestly tell you.
p274/p274_269|No production contract is yet in sight.
p274/p274_296|We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
p274/p274_289|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p274/p274_130|That would open the gates of hell.
p274/p274_199|He should emerge as the winner.
p274/p274_079|It is the only company of its kind in the UK.
p274/p274_064|There could be a way back.
p274/p274_438|Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
p274/p274_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p274/p274_210|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p274/p274_053|We felt it was sufficient.
p274/p274_430|The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
p274/p274_043|He will need that machine.
p274/p274_421|I was pleased with my own game.
p274/p274_097|The following are the principal provisions.
p274/p274_123|What happened in that game?
p274/p274_419|The second goal was superb.
p274/p274_249|The effects are not all bad.
p274/p274_184|Miller was every bit as happy.
p274/p274_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p274/p274_098|I did not concentrate on my performance.
p274/p274_207|It was worth a photograph.
p274/p274_177|And they were being paid?
p274/p274_399|The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
p274/p274_049|We are certainly talking about many millions.
p274/p274_238|Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
p274/p274_235|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p274/p274_124|Are you going to win?
p274/p274_294|Strikers like to go to the ground.
p274/p274_339|There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
p274/p274_365|It was a unanimous decision.
p274/p274_149|I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
p274/p274_221|The red card was okay.
p274/p274_413|But the foundations have been laid.
p274/p274_156|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p274/p274_034|Several investments have already been made.
p274/p274_261|You can feel at home in China.
p274/p274_240|You will have seen the adverts.
p274/p274_188|The interim dividend has been passed.
p274/p274_446|It wouldn't matter if he had.
p274/p274_045|I had come back from London.
p274/p274_376|Yesterday was a statement of intent.
p274/p274_190|Aberdeen had little to offer.
p274/p274_246|I was just a kid.
p274/p274_200|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p274/p274_120|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p274/p274_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p274/p274_110|We have a team to reach the final.
p274/p274_232|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p274/p274_134|This is a major championship.
p274/p274_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p274/p274_114|It was a good game to watch.
p274/p274_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p274/p274_248|Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
p274/p274_426|Being captain of this club is fantastic.
p274/p274_428|It needs to be volatile.
p274/p274_080|The ethos of the school was outstanding.
p274/p274_306|We will deliver at director level.
p274/p274_307|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p274/p274_459|Now that business is banned.
p274/p274_138|I think he's the favourite, no question.
p274/p274_094|He is not a dancer.
p274/p274_280|I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
p274/p274_219|People should make their own decisions.
p274/p274_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p274/p274_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p274/p274_047|I had trouble with the producers.
p274/p274_331|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p274/p274_096|In the end we made too many errors.
p274/p274_111|You can spend money on housing.
p274/p274_244|Three weeks later, he resigned.
p274/p274_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
p274/p274_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p274/p274_286|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p274/p274_046|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p274/p274_150|The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
p274/p274_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p274/p274_420|Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
p274/p274_187|It could be done by experts and lawyers.
p274/p274_258|Kingfisher can afford to wait.
p274/p274_194|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p274/p274_293|And Michael was just great.
p274/p274_410|I've had a wonderful career.
p274/p274_454|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p274/p274_402|Clark is back on top form.
p274/p274_423|This should put downward pressure on inflation.
p274/p274_427|Such an attack is bizarre.
p274/p274_173|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p274/p274_201|That might mean another delay.
p274/p274_393|The law would appear to be on our side.
p274/p274_203|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p274/p274_038|Among them are many criminals.
p274/p274_319|McNaughton was not so sure.
p274/p274_333|The group is not paying a dividend.
p274/p274_052|The latter were not from Scotland.
p274/p274_409|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p274/p274_347|The business model is actually very exciting.
p274/p274_143|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p274/p274_157|They should stop the bombing.
p274/p274_090|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p274/p274_083|Our mother is very worried.
p274/p274_279|He took over our lives.
p274/p274_112|It's not a quick fix.
p274/p274_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p274/p274_407|Nobody will be forced to work.
p274/p274_167|The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
p274/p274_311|Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
p274/p274_193|We represent a wide range of society.
p274/p274_225|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p274/p274_403|We're not taking any risks.
p274/p274_070|What do we do?
p274/p274_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p274/p274_375|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p274/p274_362|We are in a global market.
p274/p274_359|We have very limited capacity.
p274/p274_361|It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
p274/p274_422|This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
p274/p274_073|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p274/p274_140|The BBC was a disgrace.
p274/p274_299|It is a flexible concept.
p274/p274_302|So the Government will be damaged.
p274/p274_447|No further details of expansion plans were given.
p274/p274_282|It is also very valuable.
p274/p274_215|I am considered a teenager.
p274/p274_317|Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
p274/p274_327|Is it worth it?
p274/p274_170|But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
p274/p274_105|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p274/p274_109|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p274/p274_102|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p274/p274_243|I was released after six days.
p274/p274_206|I won't make an official complaint.
p274/p274_464|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p274/p274_442|Their condition is described as satisfactory.
p274/p274_060|He hadn't had them for a long time.
p274/p274_142|The referee faces a massive job.
p274/p274_058|We will pay their bills.
p274/p274_313|The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
p274/p274_398|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p274/p274_253|Do you think we are a top nation?
p274/p274_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p274/p274_189|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p274/p274_164|But it is different in different regions.
p274/p274_404|Neither man has been charged.
p274/p274_367|He had no previous convictions.
p274/p274_345|Our season is not finished.
p274/p274_436|No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
p274/p274_078|I first met him last summer.
p274/p274_368|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
p274/p274_373|After the match, do you?
p274/p274_117|We had another last Tuesday.
p274/p274_444|They are interior designers and architects.
p274/p274_416|A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
p274/p274_460|Let that be their memorial.
p274/p274_089|The processing plant was closed yesterday.
p274/p274_030|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p274/p274_076|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p274/p274_151|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
p274/p274_062|It's not covered by the insurance.
p274/p274_050|The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
p274/p274_435|Its failure is no surprise.
p274/p274_101|Our house was very small.
p274/p274_370|Does it matter?
p274/p274_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p274/p274_315|The songs are just so good.
p274/p274_308|I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
p274/p274_176|Says the Duke of York.
p274/p274_037|They said she was stable.
p274/p274_385|It will be completed within a year.
p274/p274_036|The boy is no longer with us.
p274/p274_056|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p274/p274_462|Driving has been the key.
p274/p274_418|George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
p274/p274_463|It's because they can't understand the language.
p274/p274_237|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p274/p274_338|It is a court case.
p274/p274_336|And he goes with it.
p274/p274_450|We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
p274/p274_181|Is it in the right place?
p274/p274_356|It's wonderful to have won.
p274/p274_212|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p274/p274_401|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p274/p274_337|There will be good prospects ahead.
p274/p274_334|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p274/p274_433|There is another important factor.
p274/p274_141|But she was very human.
p274/p274_379|Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
p274/p274_324|So what happens next?
p274/p274_198|Everyone can have their opinion.
p274/p274_057|He's not getting into any games.
p274/p274_242|It will now be revived.
p274/p274_443|Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
p274/p274_055|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p274/p274_171|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p274/p274_154|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p274/p274_218|It was a crazy day.
p274/p274_332|But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.
p274/p274_316|Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
p274/p274_183|They bought the property four years ago.
p274/p274_139|It is a vicious circle.
p274/p274_350|Other people had looked at it.
p274/p274_272|This idea has been around for four years.
p274/p274_216|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p274/p274_162|We came across the first set of bodies.
p274/p274_135|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p274/p274_044|People want to see me on the screen.
p274/p274_414|That is the ultimate revenge.
p274/p274_236|Wilson will tell the truth.
p274/p274_377|Those people must be accountable.
p274/p274_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p274/p274_465|The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
p274/p274_092|It was clear on Thursday.
p274/p274_439|His message was very simple.
p274/p274_262|He will go a long way.
p274/p274_469|He will not be involved in school discipline.
p274/p274_461|The boys are mentally focused.
p274/p274_146|The whole industry is a shambles.
p274/p274_063|We need to increase the membership.
p274/p274_348|There was some merit in that.
p274/p274_352|It was tough to contain the excitement.
p274/p274_239|Those overseas offices were great.
p274/p274_432|The trial will open today.
p274/p274_132|I feel very grateful with everything.
p274/p274_204|The result is utterly compelling.
p274/p274_191|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p274/p274_270|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p274/p274_179|What was the matter for concern?
p274/p274_211|They have known the hard times.
p274/p274_417|They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
p274/p274_400|It has only been rumours.
p274/p274_266|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p274/p274_318|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p274/p274_168|It's not good at all.
p274/p274_251|Does that put pressure on us?
p274/p274_069|Do I have a favourite?
p274/p274_068|So is that it, then?
p274/p274_466|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p274/p274_254|Is our children learning?
p274/p274_169|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p274/p274_192|I'm interested in interesting work.
p274/p274_158|Scotland came very close in the second Test.
p274/p274_209|We have an election in eight days.
p274/p274_147|We have to speed up the process.
p274/p274_451|It could cause a little bit of disruption.
p274/p274_411|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p274/p274_178|was everything done to save people?
p274/p274_408|I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
p274/p274_106|Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
p274/p274_363|The Allies intend to maintain the average.
p274/p274_382|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p274/p274_374|It had been a magical moment.
p274/p274_273|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p274/p274_247|There were no reports of casualties.
p274/p274_155|The danger is always there.
p274/p274_222|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p274/p274_372|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p274/p274_066|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p274/p274_245|Others agreed with this view.
p274/p274_077|There may be reasons for it.
p274/p274_275|He is quite well organised.
p274/p274_470|You have to have a proven track record to get them.
p274/p274_121|That is far too high.
p274/p274_099|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p274/p274_322|Is there a waiting list?
p274/p274_229|The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
p274/p274_383|It was like a weekly wage.
p274/p274_364|Italy was just behind the US.
p274/p274_455|It was like someone had died.
p274/p274_329|I was brought up in a mining background.
p274/p274_226|William Hague delighted his party.
p274/p274_291|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p274/p274_281|This will look at consumer attitudes.
p274/p274_424|Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
p274/p274_353|Either team will be hard.
p274/p274_126|Why change it?
p274/p274_378|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p274/p274_031|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p274/p274_234|It depends on Labour, not on us.
p274/p274_196|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
p274/p274_250|He would not impose a fine.
p274/p274_107|We deserve a significant rise.
p274/p274_041|He looks like an Afghan.
p274/p274_354|The pain is still acute.
p274/p274_277|On the contrary they stand to gain.
p282/p282_151|I was stunned.
p282/p282_346|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p282/p282_216|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p282/p282_063|It happened so quickly.
p282/p282_302|There's no evidence he was ever there.
p282/p282_350|That would help.
p282/p282_149|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p282/p282_266|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p282/p282_253|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p282/p282_050|A neighbour said.
p282/p282_361|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p282/p282_067|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p282/p282_138|I was dead.
p282/p282_286|She is really magic.
p282/p282_232|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p282/p282_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p282/p282_075|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p282/p282_226|I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
p282/p282_061|It is unique.
p282/p282_159|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p282/p282_076|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p282/p282_221|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p282/p282_068|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p282/p282_310|We have got to get the points from this one.
p282/p282_263|He was also married with two children.
p282/p282_255|They must play for each other.
p282/p282_217|Then another one came.
p282/p282_132|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p282/p282_181|It's an idea.
p282/p282_163|These days are long gone.
p282/p282_110|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p282/p282_058|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p282/p282_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p282/p282_307|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p282/p282_313|We are in the end game.
p282/p282_273|She looked so young.
p282/p282_059|My fitness was very poor.
p282/p282_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p282/p282_139|I don't know the full story.
p282/p282_249|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p282/p282_160|Life becomes a song.
p282/p282_055|Our people are ready.
p282/p282_135|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p282/p282_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p282/p282_136|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p282/p282_234|It's quite a line-up!
p282/p282_165|I've put my own money into this project.
p282/p282_214|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p282/p282_097|I love the Dome.
p282/p282_247|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p282/p282_304|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p282/p282_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p282/p282_241|The scene is about this?
p282/p282_235|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p282/p282_262|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p282/p282_052|There is no reason at all.
p282/p282_312|Henman has been warned.
p282/p282_032|Help is needed.
p282/p282_277|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p282/p282_036|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p282/p282_314|It will work.
p282/p282_105|I don't want to use it.
p282/p282_271|She failed in her action.
p282/p282_336|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p282/p282_183|They need to look after themselves.
p282/p282_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p282/p282_206|Feel the heat?
p282/p282_121|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p282/p282_268|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p282/p282_040|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p282/p282_367|There wasn't a goal.
p282/p282_069|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p282/p282_100|It is a love affair.
p282/p282_054|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p282/p282_261|He has not created a Festival resource.
p282/p282_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p282/p282_089|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p282/p282_030|This is the window.
p282/p282_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p282/p282_225|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p282/p282_161|Well, he should know.
p282/p282_144|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p282/p282_305|The letters are going out today.
p282/p282_093|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p282/p282_193|It is a farce.
p282/p282_369|Colour was at the core of his life.
p282/p282_322|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p282/p282_233|Of course I was tempted.
p282/p282_112|Is that right?
p282/p282_199|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p282/p282_154|They have not been named.
p282/p282_229|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p282/p282_365|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p282/p282_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p282/p282_351|My husband was angry.
p282/p282_044|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p282/p282_164|I'd love to be like Peter.
p282/p282_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p282/p282_197|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p282/p282_172|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p282/p282_267|One knows the feeling.
p282/p282_153|The weather forecast isn't good.
p282/p282_056|Here's a clue.
p282/p282_342|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p282/p282_300|This is a war over our home.
p282/p282_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p282/p282_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p282/p282_269|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p282/p282_043|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p282/p282_096|He's been hit by it.
p282/p282_104|That would be unlawful.
p282/p282_083|He is in the queue.
p282/p282_251|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p282/p282_278|You've got to have both sides.
p282/p282_362|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p282/p282_127|She really suffered for her art.
p282/p282_034|It is marvellous.
p282/p282_057|I was lost.
p282/p282_210|IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
p282/p282_321|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p282/p282_219|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p282/p282_270|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p282/p282_082|I will miss him.
p282/p282_325|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p282/p282_118|The mood is upbeat.
p282/p282_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p282/p282_303|You should be.
p282/p282_125|There were no grounds for his action.
p282/p282_288|I was the sheep.
p282/p282_243|My son was too young to die.
p282/p282_157|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p282/p282_065|It seems to have worked.
p282/p282_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p282/p282_186|Does this matter?
p282/p282_330|I've got no secret.
p282/p282_294|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p282/p282_140|Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
p282/p282_297|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p282/p282_320|Is there a new way forward?
p282/p282_356|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p282/p282_171|You had to go and see him.
p282/p282_339|She is free.
p282/p282_141|She died at her home.
p282/p282_145|I was awful.
p282/p282_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p282/p282_257|There's not much money in cycling.
p282/p282_047|You had better believe it.
p282/p282_064|That's the truth.
p282/p282_094|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p282/p282_355|This is a club on the rise.
p282/p282_364|It is a simple equation.
p282/p282_272|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p282/p282_222|I'd never seen a play about me.
p282/p282_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p282/p282_133|It plans to return to this field.
p282/p282_051|It is bizarre.
p282/p282_246|It was a hit.
p282/p282_115|It was the eighties.
p282/p282_062|I expect a rapid response.
p282/p282_319|Feel the air, the space.
p282/p282_049|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p282/p282_187|Our team is just so young.
p282/p282_087|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p282/p282_190|It caused a lot of upset.
p282/p282_208|Twaddle is a case in point.
p282/p282_238|It is hard won.
p282/p282_293|One was a lawyer.
p282/p282_279|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p282/p282_182|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p282/p282_211|Work has started.
p282/p282_357|Their time has gone.
p282/p282_334|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p282/p282_130|No production was achieved.
p282/p282_202|Sadly, it can't.
p282/p282_327|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p282/p282_290|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p282/p282_041|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p282/p282_173|In a way he was.
p282/p282_168|I was in the train station overnight.
p282/p282_295|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p282/p282_126|I'm so angry.
p282/p282_095|Yet, it worked.
p282/p282_256|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p282/p282_099|However, we have not come to any conclusions.
p282/p282_074|It could take some time.
p282/p282_353|And he laughs.
p282/p282_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p282/p282_039|Indeed, he does.
p282/p282_248|That could be in place by next year.
p282/p282_033|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p282/p282_085|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p282/p282_048|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p282/p282_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p282/p282_084|I first met him last summer.
p282/p282_224|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p282/p282_073|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p282/p282_148|It is not just about pay.
p282/p282_114|It's a shame.
p282/p282_102|They make a selective perception process.
p282/p282_129|It is not a U-turn.
p282/p282_194|Peace was won.
p282/p282_092|We are on the path of change.
p282/p282_289|I was brought up in a mining background.
p282/p282_156|My Dad is a hero.
p282/p282_354|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p282/p282_274|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p282/p282_037|They're just different.
p282/p282_124|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p282/p282_203|It was worth a photograph.
p282/p282_142|He realises his mistake.
p282/p282_252|they fail to engage.
p282/p282_143|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p282/p282_081|What has changed?
p282/p282_254|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p282/p282_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p282/p282_147|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p282/p282_178|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p282/p282_283|Who will perform?
p282/p282_301|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p282/p282_282|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p282/p282_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p282/p282_298|There were no passengers on board.
p282/p282_192|We speak about the performance.
p282/p282_292|But it's a subtle process.
p282/p282_078|The party is up for it.
p282/p282_316|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p282/p282_309|She is very distinctive.
p282/p282_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p282/p282_188|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p282/p282_237|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p282/p282_155|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p282/p282_280|Dialogue is the key.
p282/p282_215|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p282/p282_317|Our message was inclusive.
p282/p282_368|Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
p282/p282_209|It had all been arranged.
p282/p282_333|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p282/p282_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p282/p282_079|People must remain vigilant.
p282/p282_345|As, indeed, they would be.
p282/p282_306|Is there on his hands?
p282/p282_218|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p282/p282_276|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p282/p282_088|They lived for their children.
p282/p282_200|Who will pay for this?
p282/p282_363|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p282/p282_175|Blair's response was weak.
p282/p282_284|This is a national crisis.
p282/p282_258|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p282/p282_358|He could make it.
p282/p282_245|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p282/p282_169|We have a budget in March.
p282/p282_338|Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
p282/p282_315|I came into this world with nothing.
p282/p282_201|It's all about money, money, money.
p282/p282_176|As we worked.
p282/p282_275|It's so awful.
p282/p282_077|It is a job creation scheme.
p282/p282_291|Nothing is safe.
p282/p282_329|Two people were interviewed.
p282/p282_332|This is a friendly match?
p282/p282_167|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p282/p282_250|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p282/p282_107|It was an adventure.
p282/p282_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p282/p282_236|The minister is the engineer.
p282/p282_196|I came home by ambulance.
p282/p282_227|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p282/p282_285|Who did the recruiting?
p282/p282_228|My wife and family are the support system.
p282/p282_348|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p282/p282_352|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p282/p282_287|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p282/p282_299|It could work.
p282/p282_031|He was jailed for five years.
p282/p282_242|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p282/p282_122|We enjoyed it today.
p282/p282_137|Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
p282/p282_220|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p282/p282_071|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p282/p282_230|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p282/p282_347|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p282/p282_180|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p282/p282_264|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p282/p282_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p282/p282_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p282/p282_335|They should take their mobile phones.
p282/p282_296|They are wrong.
p282/p282_370|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p282/p282_191|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p282/p282_066|This is the first step.
p282/p282_120|Who would be a referee?
p282/p282_337|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p282/p282_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p282/p282_231|We are so proud.
p282/p282_359|The death rates are still as high.
p282/p282_123|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p282/p282_341|Tyson is overwhelmed.
p282/p282_072|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p282/p282_349|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p282/p282_326|Three years ago he would have been.
p282/p282_204|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p282/p282_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p282/p282_205|We have an election in eight days.
p282/p282_328|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p282/p282_340|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p282/p282_170|We should do everything at a stroke.
p282/p282_223|It's not before time.
p282/p282_343|Yet he left a few days later.
p282/p282_281|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p282/p282_240|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p282/p282_128|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p282/p282_106|Oil embargo endorsed.
p282/p282_323|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p282/p282_162|Was this element always there?
p282/p282_038|It was clear.
p282/p282_053|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p282/p282_042|Dancing was her life.
p282/p282_185|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p282/p282_152|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p282/p282_259|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p282/p282_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p282/p282_198|Is that success?
p282/p282_158|Words were not required.
p282/p282_111|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p282/p282_308|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p282/p282_244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p282/p282_265|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p282/p282_091|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p282/p282_119|It is rubbish.
p282/p282_086|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p282/p282_311|You may have a short memory.
p282/p282_195|It's a fact.
p282/p282_070|But I've won both ways.
p282/p282_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p282/p282_189|However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
p282/p282_080|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
p282/p282_324|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p282/p282_212|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p282/p282_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p282/p282_045|They want to be entertained.
p282/p282_207|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p282/p282_166|It has to be now.
p282/p282_179|The goals were good.
p282/p282_260|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p282/p282_134|We work well together.
p282/p282_239|Our policy is clear.
p282/p282_344|It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
p282/p282_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p282/p282_131|I am now unemployed.
p282/p282_318|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p282/p282_184|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p282/p282_025|But it failed.
p282/p282_331|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p282/p282_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p282/p282_146|Who would have?
p282/p282_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p282/p282_060|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p282/p282_103|Two of the team became ill.
p282/p282_366|It was a funny game.
p282/p282_113|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p282/p282_177|We are the gateway to justice.
p282/p282_117|Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
p282/p282_150|There was a substantial explosion.
p282/p282_360|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p282/p282_046|It's the only thing.
p256/p256_264|I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
p256/p256_297|The home was now under new management.
p256/p256_056|Sadly, it can't.
p256/p256_236|A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
p256/p256_255|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p256/p256_182|They will run a mile.
p256/p256_214|The FBI could become involved.
p256/p256_141|We want to keep the pound.
p256/p256_243|It is hard won.
p256/p256_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p256/p256_319|Henman has been warned.
p256/p256_262|I am very angry.
p256/p256_171|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p256/p256_154|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p256/p256_094|A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
p256/p256_128|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p256/p256_035|It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
p256/p256_025|It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
p256/p256_257|Chelsea was a great club.
p256/p256_223|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p256/p256_301|Our task is to complete the picture.
p256/p256_220|It's so special.
p256/p256_207|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p256/p256_161|A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
p256/p256_176|The hotel was now for sale.
p256/p256_222|He seemed to lose his focus.
p256/p256_200|I have a cold.
p256/p256_140|It was very frightened and dirty.
p256/p256_213|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p256/p256_212|It had all been arranged.
p256/p256_152|We should be clear about the role of government.
p256/p256_137|It is also well received.
p256/p256_250|It was a hit.
p256/p256_082|This is the way things should be handled.
p256/p256_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p256/p256_107|But it was a pleasure.
p256/p256_305|It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
p256/p256_054|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p256/p256_145|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p256/p256_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p256/p256_261|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p256/p256_148|I was so nervous.
p256/p256_279|It happens from time to time.
p256/p256_189|It is a terrible loss.
p256/p256_228|The track is currently covered in snow.
p256/p256_147|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p256/p256_266|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p256/p256_036|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p256/p256_225|I am immensely sad.
p256/p256_117|It was ugly.
p256/p256_045|No meaningful response was issued.
p256/p256_251|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p256/p256_277|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p256/p256_173|We've made a couple of albums.
p256/p256_075|I was as strong as a horse.
p256/p256_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p256/p256_196|It is a case of taking a risk.
p256/p256_133|Who will attend?
p256/p256_192|I am totally surprised.
p256/p256_098|She told The Herald.
p256/p256_307|It is no surprise.
p256/p256_110|I didn't play well last year.
p256/p256_076|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p256/p256_318|It's not even finished.
p256/p256_046|That period was a struggle.
p256/p256_215|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p256/p256_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p256/p256_294|Who can predict?
p256/p256_163|We have to move forward.
p256/p256_187|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p256/p256_091|We do not get that impression now.
p256/p256_032|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p256/p256_269|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p256/p256_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p256/p256_157|He can do no wrong.
p256/p256_201|The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
p256/p256_109|But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
p256/p256_057|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p256/p256_283|The attacker died in the crash.
p256/p256_168|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p256/p256_041|It had been played at festivals.
p256/p256_177|The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
p256/p256_172|It is too much for me.
p256/p256_282|I saw it at a ruck.
p256/p256_064|And a film maker was born.
p256/p256_202|Tommy is not a problem.
p256/p256_234|It's quite nice.
p256/p256_135|The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
p256/p256_105|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p256/p256_081|I've got the shirt.
p256/p256_281|But I've won both ways.
p256/p256_122|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p256/p256_195|Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
p256/p256_275|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p256/p256_037|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p256/p256_183|Four policemen were wounded.
p256/p256_232|The body follows the mind.
p256/p256_143|The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
p256/p256_050|It's a blessing.
p256/p256_071|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p256/p256_315|They were fantastic.
p256/p256_272|It was an easy decision to come here.
p256/p256_291|He wrote the letter two days before he died.
p256/p256_208|It's like a garage.
p256/p256_278|In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
p256/p256_253|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p256/p256_235|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p256/p256_197|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p256/p256_061|That is very hard, alone.
p256/p256_285|It's like a high school play.
p256/p256_088|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p256/p256_077|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p256/p256_102|They are now divorced.
p256/p256_292|The results are sometimes contentious.
p256/p256_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p256/p256_265|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p256/p256_031|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p256/p256_181|Nothing is safe.
p256/p256_070|They are real.
p256/p256_179|I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
p256/p256_096|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p256/p256_258|That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
p256/p256_053|I would love to have him home.
p256/p256_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p256/p256_210|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
p256/p256_217|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p256/p256_043|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p256/p256_139|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p256/p256_100|There was no rescue.
p256/p256_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p256/p256_150|They have not been named.
p256/p256_304|It's just not funny!
p256/p256_125|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p256/p256_191|If the director is with you.
p256/p256_286|Scotland were beaten again.
p256/p256_038|They're just different.
p256/p256_185|We did everything by the book.
p256/p256_298|I thought it was my only chance.
p256/p256_165|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p256/p256_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p256/p256_130|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p256/p256_186|They need to look after themselves.
p256/p256_044|This film will be totally awesome.
p256/p256_001|Please call Stella.
p256/p256_241|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p256/p256_033|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p256/p256_198|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p256/p256_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p256/p256_242|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p256/p256_040|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p256/p256_051|Is a drug dealer?
p256/p256_280|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p256/p256_289|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p256/p256_184|They receive a high profile in the media.
p256/p256_203|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p256/p256_039|It's a real threat.
p256/p256_237|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p256/p256_060|That's the truth.
p256/p256_248|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p256/p256_121|Who would be a referee?
p256/p256_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p256/p256_066|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p256/p256_167|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p256/p256_126|There were no grounds for his action.
p256/p256_113|It's not perfect.
p256/p256_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p256/p256_118|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p256/p256_103|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p256/p256_296|It became a book by itself.
p256/p256_086|I first met him last summer.
p256/p256_151|There's a sense of excess in the novel.
p256/p256_233|It is set in Paris.
p256/p256_211|She should not be blamed.
p256/p256_112|They will want to perform well.
p256/p256_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p256/p256_174|It is not either national standards or local control.
p256/p256_069|There was a battle there.
p256/p256_136|Our intentions are real.
p256/p256_162|It has to be now.
p256/p256_170|Does that put pressure on us?
p256/p256_095|We must look forward.
p256/p256_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p256/p256_134|Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
p256/p256_268|It looks as though he will be right.
p256/p256_311|This is the culture change in medicine.
p256/p256_114|It was the eighties.
p256/p256_106|Get to know him.
p256/p256_276|I am an estate agent.
p256/p256_310|We have waited a long time for this.
p256/p256_194|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p256/p256_156|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p256/p256_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p256/p256_111|Before the game we went for a pint.
p256/p256_067|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p256/p256_290|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p256/p256_068|They may yet have the last laugh.
p256/p256_049|It is difficult for Ali.
p256/p256_058|It is unique.
p256/p256_062|In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
p256/p256_256|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p256/p256_115|They were behind the wheel.
p256/p256_074|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p256/p256_138|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p256/p256_287|It's very safe.
p256/p256_166|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p256/p256_123|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p256/p256_244|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p256/p256_312|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p256/p256_099|It was clear.
p256/p256_155|We will turn the corner.
p256/p256_288|He was obviously very genuine.
p256/p256_249|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p256/p256_087|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p256/p256_180|There is no point in looking any further.
p256/p256_295|They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
p256/p256_227|My neighbours are horrified.
p256/p256_108|We have every respect for Michelle.
p256/p256_089|It's never too late.
p256/p256_230|They are the innocent victims.
p256/p256_231|My wife and family are the support system.
p256/p256_169|The post will be unpaid.
p256/p256_209|But I am a worried man.
p256/p256_199|People acted too quickly.
p256/p256_206|It was worth a photograph.
p256/p256_144|It changed my life.
p256/p256_316|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p256/p256_104|Journalists should make him.
p256/p256_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p256/p256_116|This is a step backwards.
p256/p256_238|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p256/p256_247|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p256/p256_027|I have a theory.
p256/p256_219|We've got the bronze.
p256/p256_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p256/p256_259|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p256/p256_303|It's so awful.
p256/p256_079|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p256/p256_284|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p256/p256_065|It's a matter of balance.
p256/p256_308|Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
p256/p256_124|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p256/p256_034|A web site is planned for November.
p256/p256_273|And Michael was just great.
p256/p256_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p256/p256_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p256/p256_047|A neighbour said.
p256/p256_055|He had no enemies.
p256/p256_129|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p256/p256_313|This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
p256/p256_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p256/p256_246|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p256/p256_193|I grew up listening to these people.
p256/p256_164|They are not advertised.
p256/p256_320|It should be equal.
p256/p256_072|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p256/p256_300|One was a lawyer.
p256/p256_317|She is very distinctive.
p256/p256_302|The party lasted all night.
p256/p256_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p256/p256_028|Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
p256/p256_083|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p256/p256_293|The songs are just so good.
p256/p256_178|They took a risk.
p256/p256_059|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p256/p256_204|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p256/p256_127|Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
p256/p256_254|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p256/p256_216|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p256/p256_158|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p256/p256_026|We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
p256/p256_078|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p256/p256_314|It is all credit to them today.
p256/p256_093|That will come after the game on Saturday.
p256/p256_309|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p256/p256_119|I joined a group.
p256/p256_252|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p256/p256_160|I will tell you.
p256/p256_175|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p256/p256_260|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p256/p256_101|We could not get any possession.
p256/p256_221|We will be victorious.
p256/p256_132|Well, you can have a tree.
p256/p256_306|Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
p256/p256_090|It was nice.
p256/p256_240|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p256/p256_263|The pensioners did not want to know.
p256/p256_270|He has not created a Festival resource.
p256/p256_159|These days are long gone.
p256/p256_226|It is a gamble.
p256/p256_063|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p256/p256_267|That's the only thing I will say.
p256/p256_271|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p256/p256_048|It's a crucial award.
p256/p256_274|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p256/p256_120|It is rubbish.
p256/p256_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p256/p256_080|It is a terrible place.
p256/p256_029|There's a story, too.
p256/p256_052|It has been a horrible, horrible time.
p256/p256_142|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p256/p256_239|He was good, but not that good.
p256/p256_245|The scene is about this?
p256/p256_042|Indeed, he does.
p256/p256_153|It was by the numbers.
p256/p256_131|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p256/p256_030|I was an athlete.
p256/p256_218|The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
p256/p256_092|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p256/p256_190|Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
p256/p256_229|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p256/p256_073|It should be devolved.
p256/p256_146|It is not just about pay.
p256/p256_205|But she might be.
p256/p256_085|It may well have been.
p256/p256_188|My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
p256/p256_097|They've got to account for it.
p256/p256_084|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p256/p256_224|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p256/p256_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p362/p362_319|The timing is obvious.
p362/p362_250|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p362/p362_343|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p362/p362_181|That was the finest moment in my career.
p362/p362_299|We know the goals will come.
p362/p362_275|For some, it might not make too much difference.
p362/p362_049|They finished second and third.
p362/p362_382|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p362/p362_332|It is quite hard to track.
p362/p362_311|This is the only problem with the story.
p362/p362_039|To beat the European champion is quite nice.
p362/p362_244|We don't want to be too intrusive.
p362/p362_374|We all want the same things.
p362/p362_305|He did it all for us.
p362/p362_245|The most important thing is the game.
p362/p362_417|I had no idea.
p362/p362_396|It is patently true.
p362/p362_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p362/p362_298|Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
p362/p362_286|He will not be coming back.
p362/p362_043|They were impressive against France.
p362/p362_056|This was no accident.
p362/p362_237|He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
p362/p362_391|He can win every week.
p362/p362_076|The real problem is the Usher Hall.
p362/p362_267|Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
p362/p362_120|The fire was still coming down.
p362/p362_063|Policing the profession is important.
p362/p362_243|It doesn't make them evil.
p362/p362_134|The building was starting to come down.
p362/p362_162|So is the rest of British sport.
p362/p362_351|It doesn't make me feel any better.
p362/p362_080|I found the course inspiring.
p362/p362_390|No progress has been made.
p362/p362_376|She died in hospital two hours later.
p362/p362_186|Film music was never the same again.
p362/p362_359|That is very hard, alone.
p362/p362_031|They responded in the most positive way.
p362/p362_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p362/p362_326|CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.
p362/p362_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p362/p362_255|We are in a very strong position.
p362/p362_113|I've never felt affection for Emu.
p362/p362_280|It has been a major success.
p362/p362_354|We are delighted with the result.
p362/p362_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p362/p362_094|Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
p362/p362_289|It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
p362/p362_105|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p362/p362_272|There's always a chance.
p362/p362_083|I thought he was part of the camera.
p362/p362_394|The plot is changing as time goes on.
p362/p362_358|It is having a big impact.
p362/p362_306|I don't think that is good enough.
p362/p362_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p362/p362_075|But there is good and bad.
p362/p362_254|We did not play well.
p362/p362_253|So what went wrong?
p362/p362_362|The same goes for Russia.
p362/p362_153|A century on, little has changed.
p362/p362_268|I want to concentrate on the real issues.
p362/p362_100|There's a strong involvement.
p362/p362_146|Who is going to pay their wages?
p362/p362_406|He added that he felt undermined.
p362/p362_371|We need to increase the membership.
p362/p362_150|Feel the air, the space.
p362/p362_239|But the killing will continue.
p362/p362_262|She is now planning a visit.
p362/p362_334|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p362/p362_422|He got the part.
p362/p362_232|That had never happened.
p362/p362_079|I don't know what it means.
p362/p362_178|He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
p362/p362_101|This is complete nonsense.
p362/p362_278|But it was to no avail.
p362/p362_053|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p362/p362_365|One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
p362/p362_257|That is the key.
p362/p362_331|The time commitment is the biggest thing.
p362/p362_131|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p362/p362_179|What was that all about?
p362/p362_241|But we are working together for this result.
p362/p362_095|Sure, this is a very important event for me.
p362/p362_074|She's afraid of life.
p362/p362_135|No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
p362/p362_287|He is also a great finisher.
p362/p362_274|For me, it's a tension you can feel.
p362/p362_421|I want to help other women.
p362/p362_355|It will take time.
p362/p362_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p362/p362_188|I thought he was at fault.
p362/p362_392|This makes up for it.
p362/p362_288|I don't see any problem.
p362/p362_065|She had no chance.
p362/p362_061|And there has been a good start.
p362/p362_151|I have nothing to regret.
p362/p362_318|It is good news for us.
p362/p362_198|Do what you want to do.
p362/p362_070|Allison is not convinced.
p362/p362_259|Well, until recently he didn't think so.
p362/p362_307|Of course it is.
p362/p362_285|I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
p362/p362_158|However, the story has a happy ending.
p362/p362_132|I had been hoping for justice.
p362/p362_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p362/p362_184|There is no conflict of interest.
p362/p362_413|We are trying to do it properly.
p362/p362_234|They are not suitable.
p362/p362_384|There may be reasons for it.
p362/p362_145|The choice is simple.
p362/p362_240|They've got to get better.
p362/p362_123|It will be tight.
p362/p362_176|Only two players have done it.
p362/p362_333|It's not going to last five minutes.
p362/p362_416|He is wanted by German police for questioning.
p362/p362_342|They are in good spirits.
p362/p362_168|People also have trouble with the currency.
p362/p362_164|It was his greatest movie performance.
p362/p362_194|Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
p362/p362_214|It is a worry.
p362/p362_322|I don't think it's very real.
p362/p362_367|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p362/p362_350|And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
p362/p362_346|So far he has not done so.
p362/p362_215|We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
p362/p362_027|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p362/p362_330|She asked for the appointment with me.
p362/p362_238|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p362/p362_118|You see, my back has gone.
p362/p362_225|It also makes for interesting viewing.
p362/p362_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p362/p362_419|We made a world record together.
p362/p362_325|Is that what people want?
p362/p362_324|I think she was right.
p362/p362_037|It's not Big Brother at sea.
p362/p362_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p362/p362_339|Doesn't matter what you do.
p362/p362_397|Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
p362/p362_041|As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
p362/p362_218|Gas is too expensive.
p362/p362_059|With him are the symbols of his faith.
p362/p362_143|The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
p362/p362_261|I can't deny that fact.
p362/p362_393|My mind was made up.
p362/p362_263|We could have done without this.
p362/p362_077|That is her job.
p362/p362_170|We've got to get back to normal.
p362/p362_226|Life becomes a song.
p362/p362_173|An inquiry has begun.
p362/p362_213|I think that's a bit of an invasion.
p362/p362_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p362/p362_373|We should not be complacent.
p362/p362_192|Something happened on that island.
p362/p362_265|Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
p362/p362_309|It was published yesterday on the internet.
p362/p362_387|Yes, it took time to recover.
p362/p362_409|But it looks good for next year.
p362/p362_147|I don't think we deserved to lose.
p362/p362_177|He is a master of deceit and delay.
p362/p362_028|I feel really good.
p362/p362_110|There have been so many.
p362/p362_294|All is now forgiven.
p362/p362_090|It benefits the whole family.
p362/p362_115|Anyone can take a photo.
p362/p362_108|I know he meant it.
p362/p362_084|She is now on the back benches.
p362/p362_356|They will do something big.
p362/p362_193|This is a business.
p362/p362_313|Knowledge is everything at this level.
p362/p362_141|That is my dream.
p362/p362_096|They have to work so hard.
p362/p362_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p362/p362_357|The programme was awful.
p362/p362_169|I always wanted her to be happy.
p362/p362_125|Both are national treasures.
p362/p362_216|That is highly unfair.
p362/p362_266|He's a great dealer.
p362/p362_044|This is only one example.
p362/p362_203|But we have learned that it doesn't.
p362/p362_112|Of course, it is nonsense.
p362/p362_269|He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
p362/p362_314|Is that right?
p362/p362_107|The task is enormous.
p362/p362_386|It's a good offer by any standards.
p362/p362_091|It's not my fault.
p362/p362_029|It was a fairy tale.
p362/p362_072|And it was this one.
p362/p362_045|His style is suited to Scottish football.
p362/p362_087|One is investment, one is reform.
p362/p362_424|He refused to name the survivors.
p362/p362_127|Well, you don't have time.
p362/p362_160|Even for a British Open, this is different.
p362/p362_166|So, easy does it.
p362/p362_195|I never had any real direction at school.
p362/p362_281|It takes a bit of working out.
p362/p362_048|England could not take anything for granted, however.
p362/p362_126|I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
p362/p362_328|It will be a new experience.
p362/p362_068|How is he enjoying life as a senior?
p362/p362_204|I'm looking forward to coming home.
p362/p362_099|What kind of person is he?
p362/p362_136|There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
p362/p362_277|They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
p362/p362_410|Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
p362/p362_064|Seems a sensible compromise.
p362/p362_336|I am sure all schools would accept that.
p362/p362_315|So other options had to be explored.
p362/p362_256|This will have no effect on the championship.
p362/p362_364|Cooking is intricate and complex.
p362/p362_327|I'd like to continue that record.
p362/p362_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p362/p362_222|Are you up for business?
p362/p362_248|In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
p362/p362_154|Wrong decisions Address in full
p362/p362_092|My husband was angry.
p362/p362_349|So there we are.
p362/p362_171|Do we want to see it?
p362/p362_317|He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
p362/p362_190|We will win this tie.
p362/p362_144|Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
p362/p362_057|He is a law unto himself.
p362/p362_292|I have never felt so well.
p362/p362_414|We actually had a laugh about that.
p362/p362_323|Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
p362/p362_246|He said nothing of the sort.
p362/p362_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p362/p362_345|The support of Britain is assumed.
p362/p362_404|That's a good sign.
p362/p362_133|Labour is providing none of these.
p362/p362_042|The chances were plentiful.
p362/p362_229|We have nowhere to go.
p362/p362_209|I have no secrets.
p362/p362_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p362/p362_148|It was that kind of match.
p362/p362_249|The door is open.
p362/p362_423|Or, rather, it isn't.
p362/p362_052|Hasn't let anyone down?
p362/p362_385|He had taken everything from me.
p362/p362_117|No person was charged.
p362/p362_026|This is your country.
p362/p362_395|I never got anything out of it.
p362/p362_252|Lara is very, very much a girl.
p362/p362_033|The British government said she was coming home.
p362/p362_227|No wonder he missed the conversion.
p362/p362_228|Sadly, they did not.
p362/p362_370|Plot is not the issue.
p362/p362_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p362/p362_138|He has created the confusion.
p362/p362_197|It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
p362/p362_124|He seems to be used to the attention.
p362/p362_200|Who are the public?
p362/p362_025|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p362/p362_398|But don't just take my word, for it.
p362/p362_290|Yet it seemed to work.
p362/p362_139|He didn't get out much.
p362/p362_122|I got the surprise of my life.
p362/p362_067|I don't have a problem with it.
p362/p362_411|We want everyone to have a good time.
p362/p362_295|So who is right?
p362/p362_106|So is that it, then?
p362/p362_233|However, our players will fight for that.
p362/p362_251|Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
p362/p362_103|The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
p362/p362_399|That is why he is so special.
p362/p362_220|It was all relative.
p362/p362_175|That is not, however, the case.
p362/p362_236|You mean he didn't get the girl?
p362/p362_347|Maybe they will show it next year.
p362/p362_217|They are not the answer to staff shortages.
p362/p362_116|He is involved in everything.
p362/p362_230|He has every right to do that.
p362/p362_129|I feel it's time to make the switch.
p362/p362_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p362/p362_073|I am going to win the next two.
p362/p362_119|He's a nice guy.
p362/p362_172|That is for certain.
p362/p362_086|Three bystanders were killed.
p362/p362_201|When it is ready, it will be signed.
p362/p362_066|In the meantime, you just have to get on with it.
p362/p362_097|Well, was it?
p362/p362_183|He is appealing to women.
p362/p362_375|Maybe his time has gone.
p362/p362_383|I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
p362/p362_071|We have to move forward from now on.
p362/p362_140|She was very different.
p362/p362_312|It is good football in Scotland.
p362/p362_271|This is not a crisis.
p362/p362_301|It was an insult.
p362/p362_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p362/p362_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p362/p362_062|I feel my parents are in New York.
p362/p362_098|I thought he was my friend.
p362/p362_264|Boy is the town a mess.
p362/p362_054|We certainly hope we have been successful.
p362/p362_291|Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
p362/p362_369|We thought we were looking in good shape.
p362/p362_142|Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
p362/p362_302|But we all have to look at ourselves.
p362/p362_270|We are moving on.
p362/p362_335|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
p362/p362_205|They should not be blamed for it.
p362/p362_380|We are not getting him back.
p362/p362_420|They were outside the circle.
p362/p362_258|So, how did you do?
p362/p362_340|O no it's not!
p362/p362_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p362/p362_283|But it didn't bother me.
p362/p362_363|They went down together.
p362/p362_415|It raises the edge.
p362/p362_102|This Government is cutting taxes.
p362/p362_224|You are not in any kind of trouble.
p362/p362_388|The potential is always in the idea.
p362/p362_304|He added, We are full of anger.
p362/p362_242|Mental health is a massive issue.
p362/p362_418|As indeed it did.
p362/p362_081|I have to accept that.
p362/p362_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p362/p362_381|He was on a horse.
p362/p362_348|They are a very good team.
p362/p362_155|I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
p362/p362_361|Doesn't he miss it?
p362/p362_185|She has the biggest part.
p362/p362_157|And he still is.
p362/p362_402|This is a very serious matter.
p362/p362_047|I am so upset.
p362/p362_338|There are a number of possible outcomes.
p362/p362_231|Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
p362/p362_196|That's how it works.
p362/p362_279|Sad to say, it's still waiting.
p362/p362_297|There will be new memories.
p362/p362_109|A, The media has been great.
p362/p362_208|It was crucial strike.
p362/p362_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p362/p362_089|There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
p362/p362_221|And, within itself, it is visionary.
p362/p362_366|We were getting very worried.
p362/p362_032|I have a very strong opinion about this.
p362/p362_372|Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
p362/p362_001|Please call Stella.
p362/p362_189|The First Minister is an addict.
p362/p362_165|We go back a long way.
p362/p362_040|They had a confession.
p362/p362_206|He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
p362/p362_320|He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
p362/p362_111|Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
p362/p362_051|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p362/p362_055|He is one of them.
p362/p362_377|Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
p362/p362_161|Then he did it twice.
p362/p362_034|We are a peaceful people.
p362/p362_069|It's more relaxing this way.
p362/p362_159|You never had it so good.
p362/p362_121|It's always the way.
p362/p362_149|We couldn't believe it at first.
p362/p362_300|How can they get one?
p362/p362_078|They have broken that promise.
p362/p362_058|It is a sign of hope.
p362/p362_247|This would give Scotland around eight members.
p362/p362_187|It was a deeply moving musical experience.
p362/p362_316|They should be so lucky.
p362/p362_156|He is having a nightmare.
p362/p362_207|Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
p362/p362_400|You hope he prevails.
p362/p362_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p362/p362_296|And this tournament will travel.
p362/p362_163|Genetic assessment is crucial.
p362/p362_405|I'd never heard anything like it before.
p362/p362_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p362/p362_379|The results are tragic.
p362/p362_223|It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
p362/p362_035|His mother was English.
p362/p362_088|They could not have done more for me.
p362/p362_408|He declined to be more specific.
p362/p362_337|It was quite an ordeal for them.
p362/p362_353|The incident is dead.
p362/p362_284|I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
p362/p362_093|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p362/p362_128|I had never done anything like it before.
p362/p362_378|SO, that is it for another year.
p362/p362_407|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p362/p362_352|The conversion didn't go over either.
p362/p362_329|The process itself has taken over.
p362/p362_210|What do you want to say?
p362/p362_182|England will be quite prepared.
p362/p362_030|But there are no plans.
p362/p362_060|They're interested only in profits.
p362/p362_137|There is a subtle difference.
p362/p362_341|The result could be all down to turnout.
p362/p362_308|We all make mistakes.
p362/p362_344|He was their leader.
p362/p362_219|This plan is an agenda for action.
p362/p362_191|I think he's done it a few times.
p362/p362_104|They know their son was murdered.
p362/p362_310|That is my commitment.
p362/p362_293|There are other things going on.
p362/p362_038|Was this a new event?
p362/p362_130|But he thought the overall results were good.
p362/p362_114|He had returned to die.
p362/p362_199|We know the quality of life goes up.
p362/p362_303|We have nothing to hide.
p362/p362_085|It is not a road of life.
p362/p362_273|I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
p362/p362_036|He was jailed for five years.
p362/p362_282|I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
p362/p362_321|Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
p362/p362_167|Not that he's declined.
p362/p362_152|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p362/p362_212|They continue to do so.
p362/p362_260|It was, however, the wrong side.
p362/p362_050|But this was refused.
p362/p362_082|It means the margin for error is tight.
p362/p362_401|My mother was getting on at me.
p362/p362_235|He is advised that he has done so.
p362/p362_360|I am feeling on top of the world.
p362/p362_389|I am not a frustrated actor.
p362/p362_046|The cause is just.
p362/p362_211|I was so relieved.
p362/p362_174|I was a little surprised.
p362/p362_276|That's a very serious matter.
p362/p362_180|This is a fine appointment.
p362/p362_412|We're going to rebuild.
p362/p362_403|It's going to be great!
p362/p362_368|You can't really compare.
p249/p249_028|They should be so lucky.
p249/p249_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p249/p249_094|They lived for their children.
p249/p249_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p249/p249_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p249/p249_226|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p249/p249_042|It's a crucial award.
p249/p249_322|That's the law of the land.
p249/p249_096|Now the system is right behind us.
p249/p249_259|His contract was then not renewed.
p249/p249_075|Painful, but only because it's true.
p249/p249_302|They are wrong.
p249/p249_296|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p249/p249_088|She had kept the news from him.
p249/p249_163|They should stop the bombing.
p249/p249_078|He highlighted a lack of staff.
p249/p249_188|We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
p249/p249_169|They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
p249/p249_318|The problems began a long time ago.
p249/p249_324|I am so upset.
p249/p249_128|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p249/p249_335|I must make that clear.
p249/p249_209|I have a cold.
p249/p249_308|And he goes with it.
p249/p249_327|He was then replaced by Ross.
p249/p249_101|It is an old family habit.
p249/p249_280|There's nothing I can say.
p249/p249_293|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p249/p249_098|Today I couldn't run on it.
p249/p249_090|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p249/p249_187|Everyone can be bought.
p249/p249_164|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p249/p249_265|He has not created a Festival resource.
p249/p249_272|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p249/p249_245|We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
p249/p249_034|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p249/p249_031|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p249/p249_033|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p249/p249_229|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p249/p249_304|The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
p249/p249_241|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p249/p249_186|It should be easy.
p249/p249_124|Who would have?
p249/p249_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p249/p249_313|Is there on his hands?
p249/p249_108|The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
p249/p249_071|It is like a river running by my home.
p249/p249_129|His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
p249/p249_067|Scotland had great assets.
p249/p249_116|Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
p249/p249_100|We must look forward.
p249/p249_347|It's all going to clear the debt.
p249/p249_114|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p249/p249_224|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p249/p249_077|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p249/p249_338|The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
p249/p249_192|Miller was every bit as happy.
p249/p249_243|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p249/p249_307|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p249/p249_074|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p249/p249_168|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p249/p249_153|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p249/p249_258|They must play for each other.
p249/p249_283|You've got to have both sides.
p249/p249_341|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p249/p249_288|Scotland were beaten again.
p249/p249_037|It is not for any other purpose.
p249/p249_150|It is like a football team.
p249/p249_266|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p249/p249_305|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p249/p249_256|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p249/p249_178|The release attracted little attention.
p249/p249_321|I came into this world with nothing.
p249/p249_138|Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
p249/p249_065|You did not change overnight.
p249/p249_303|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p249/p249_197|It is tough, but possible.
p249/p249_193|We want to help them through it.
p249/p249_131|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p249/p249_189|We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
p249/p249_089|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p249/p249_139|It was very frightened and dirty.
p249/p249_351|It was very formal.
p249/p249_216|We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
p249/p249_284|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p249/p249_144|He is severe.
p249/p249_300|Our task is to complete the picture.
p249/p249_320|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p249/p249_253|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
p249/p249_247|There wasn't a goal.
p249/p249_289|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p249/p249_146|Is that Titanic?
p249/p249_200|Last night was a key episode.
p249/p249_030|There's a story, too.
p249/p249_353|I kept going for her.
p249/p249_106|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p249/p249_204|Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
p249/p249_194|I put the drawing down.
p249/p249_086|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p249/p249_029|Because we do not need it.
p249/p249_058|It is unique.
p249/p249_066|There was a battle there.
p249/p249_050|He looks like an Afghan.
p249/p249_251|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p249/p249_133|She said she could not believe that they had run away.
p249/p249_103|Until you hit the big games.
p249/p249_213|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p249/p249_332|Who will do it?
p249/p249_120|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p249/p249_097|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p249/p249_222|Twaddle is a case in point.
p249/p249_330|Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
p249/p249_337|A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
p249/p249_203|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p249/p249_113|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p249/p249_232|My neighbours are horrified.
p249/p249_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p249/p249_219|There was an e-mail.
p249/p249_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p249/p249_234|He is in the queue.
p249/p249_329|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p249/p249_279|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p249/p249_237|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p249/p249_225|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p249/p249_267|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p249/p249_319|Referees are easy targets.
p249/p249_127|There were no grounds for his action.
p249/p249_236|Broke the birdie record.
p249/p249_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p249/p249_299|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p249/p249_073|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p249/p249_196|I had a train to catch.
p249/p249_083|Even the one she loved.
p249/p249_026|Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
p249/p249_183|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p249/p249_205|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p249/p249_214|It's all about money, money, money.
p249/p249_238|We were a load of rubbish.
p249/p249_080|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p249/p249_102|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p249/p249_278|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p249/p249_172|Tell it like it was?
p249/p249_277|He has a wealth of experience.
p249/p249_261|That's the only thing I will say.
p249/p249_165|These days are long gone.
p249/p249_068|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p249/p249_040|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p249/p249_282|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p249/p249_312|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p249/p249_111|We want to get to the final, anyway.
p249/p249_045|Is a drug dealer?
p249/p249_054|Next league matches Celtic.
p249/p249_126|You can spend money on housing.
p249/p249_271|It's not even finished.
p249/p249_326|It could have gone either way.
p249/p249_240|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p249/p249_062|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p249/p249_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p249/p249_081|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p249/p249_161|There's a pause.
p249/p249_309|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p249/p249_316|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p249/p249_255|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p249/p249_148|The idea is simple.
p249/p249_294|A new school will be built.
p249/p249_063|I'm just enjoying every match.
p249/p249_343|They should take their mobile phones.
p249/p249_340|In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
p249/p249_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p249/p249_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p249/p249_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p249/p249_306|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p249/p249_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p249/p249_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p249/p249_167|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p249/p249_060|That's the truth.
p249/p249_342|He's a genius.
p249/p249_092|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p249/p249_117|It's a long process.
p249/p249_254|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p249/p249_315|They were fantastic.
p249/p249_202|It is a case of taking a risk.
p249/p249_211|Ferguson should take note.
p249/p249_115|You had better believe it.
p249/p249_301|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p249/p249_136|What will happen then?
p249/p249_055|It happens from time to time.
p249/p249_268|It is the same in Sweden.
p249/p249_246|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p249/p249_171|We have to move forward.
p249/p249_314|Special measures were needed.
p249/p249_290|I do not think this family will ever get over this.
p249/p249_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p249/p249_191|It is not fair.
p249/p249_210|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p249/p249_201|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p249/p249_072|Try to save us.
p249/p249_177|As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
p249/p249_147|Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
p249/p249_270|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p249/p249_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p249/p249_155|The weaknesses are few.
p249/p249_132|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p249/p249_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p249/p249_244|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p249/p249_046|As she explains.
p249/p249_344|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p249/p249_257|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p249/p249_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p249/p249_274|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p249/p249_170|I'm so worried about the roads.
p249/p249_141|It's a question of fashion.
p249/p249_135|Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
p249/p249_027|It's nice to hear.
p249/p249_084|I've not thought about it.
p249/p249_049|I would love to have him home.
p249/p249_181|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p249/p249_099|However, it did not end that way.
p249/p249_152|It is not just about pay.
p249/p249_076|The play is based on a real-life event.
p249/p249_273|Things can change.
p249/p249_149|That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
p249/p249_345|Eight months later, he was dead.
p249/p249_137|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p249/p249_156|The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
p249/p249_134|We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
p249/p249_121|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p249/p249_348|He had played well in that central role.
p249/p249_208|He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
p249/p249_231|It is a gamble.
p249/p249_109|It is a good day for the coalition.
p249/p249_354|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p249/p249_221|We'll have to work hard today.
p249/p249_079|They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
p249/p249_248|I was shocked.
p249/p249_112|It is a good lifestyle.
p249/p249_047|He is too weak to move.
p249/p249_328|My view has now completely changed.
p249/p249_052|It will come all right.
p249/p249_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p249/p249_206|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
p249/p249_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p249/p249_323|There was no time scale.
p249/p249_235|Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
p249/p249_212|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p249/p249_069|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p249/p249_223|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p249/p249_285|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p249/p249_249|I should think so, too.
p249/p249_331|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p249/p249_260|He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
p249/p249_041|Sure, it's funny.
p249/p249_292|He should have won.
p249/p249_173|It is not too late to get on board.
p249/p249_262|Blood samples were taken.
p249/p249_311|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p249/p249_118|They were behind the wheel.
p249/p249_140|I was the last man to touch the ball.
p249/p249_048|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p249/p249_032|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p249/p249_107|He is hungry for success and I am the same.
p249/p249_180|I always felt they played for me.
p249/p249_218|But I am a worried man.
p249/p249_220|Feel the heat?
p249/p249_310|However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
p249/p249_336|The train was on time.
p249/p249_061|Jobs could go.
p249/p249_122|Does this mean.
p249/p249_087|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p249/p249_276|Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
p249/p249_095|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p249/p249_179|Someone who cares
p249/p249_051|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p249/p249_176|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p249/p249_059|It will take time.
p249/p249_125|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p249/p249_339|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p249/p249_198|We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
p249/p249_160|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p249/p249_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p249/p249_093|And rugby fans can help.
p249/p249_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p249/p249_130|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
p249/p249_119|It was ugly.
p249/p249_070|Have a look at our accounts.
p249/p249_199|However, this idea is never developed.
p249/p249_057|Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
p249/p249_174|We have a budget in March.
p249/p249_295|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p249/p249_286|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p249/p249_281|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p249/p249_291|These figures are truly awful.
p249/p249_110|A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
p249/p249_190|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p249/p249_123|They've got to account for it.
p249/p249_207|The service from the other players was super.
p249/p249_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p249/p249_182|The jury is still out.
p249/p249_159|It was by the numbers.
p249/p249_143|Wallace was a prisoner of war.
p249/p249_297|What has altered?
p249/p249_105|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p249/p249_317|They wanted the club to make money.
p249/p249_104|Then came the crunch.
p249/p249_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p249/p249_184|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p249/p249_145|It is difficult for Ali.
p249/p249_053|However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
p249/p249_349|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p249/p249_166|It is an attitude of mind.
p249/p249_162|Neither side can win this war.
p249/p249_043|The boy is no longer with us.
p249/p249_287|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p249/p249_056|It's very odd.
p249/p249_263|They are never here.
p249/p249_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p249/p249_064|And a film maker was born.
p249/p249_036|It was clear.
p249/p249_039|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p249/p249_275|People have no choice.
p249/p249_038|He did not know his daughter.
p249/p249_157|It is not normal practice.
p249/p249_298|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p249/p249_239|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p249/p249_350|It is horrible.
p249/p249_352|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p249/p249_082|It is a job creation scheme.
p249/p249_230|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p249/p249_154|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p249/p249_142|We need to chat.
p249/p249_185|It is not either national standards or local control.
p249/p249_269|And Michael was just great.
p249/p249_044|It's a blessing.
p249/p249_217|This is a good move for me.
p249/p249_252|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p288/p288_333|Donald was his friend.
p288/p288_401|You ask the question.
p288/p288_196|But we are not immune to the problem.
p288/p288_283|Who will perform?
p288/p288_119|It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
p288/p288_340|I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
p288/p288_131|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p288/p288_212|I was so nervous.
p288/p288_295|We have to sort it out ourselves.
p288/p288_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p288/p288_277|But I've won both ways.
p288/p288_243|It is hard won.
p288/p288_123|The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
p288/p288_079|Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
p288/p288_246|He's a lovely young man.
p288/p288_143|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p288/p288_028|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p288/p288_361|Our numbers are small.
p288/p288_321|The home team had an amazing start.
p288/p288_072|It can be halted.
p288/p288_248|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p288/p288_067|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p288/p288_172|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p288/p288_296|That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
p288/p288_120|I'm so angry.
p288/p288_245|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p288/p288_308|SCOTLAND has shown the way.
p288/p288_367|I am a star.
p288/p288_102|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p288/p288_055|It will take time.
p288/p288_392|He is on the wrong side.
p288/p288_386|There is a solution, she believes.
p288/p288_153|It has to be now.
p288/p288_059|Four other charges were dropped.
p288/p288_297|The home was now under new management.
p288/p288_129|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p288/p288_145|She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
p288/p288_325|However, the groups denied the claims.
p288/p288_312|He was solid.
p288/p288_182|It is tough, but possible.
p288/p288_144|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p288/p288_026|It is a disaster area.
p288/p288_086|By then, he was walking on water.
p288/p288_302|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p288/p288_224|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p288/p288_027|Is this accurate?
p288/p288_254|It is very important that we get the balance right.
p288/p288_236|Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
p288/p288_329|The figures are bad, but not that bad.
p288/p288_389|It's just outrageous.
p288/p288_146|Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
p288/p288_315|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p288/p288_346|I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
p288/p288_217|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p288/p288_289|So I did.
p288/p288_383|It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
p288/p288_202|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p288/p288_403|What would be the point?
p288/p288_233|I haven't made the donation yet.
p288/p288_186|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p288/p288_093|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p288/p288_335|She did not attend the courtroom.
p288/p288_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p288/p288_363|So I left.
p288/p288_407|The real enemy is in your own back yard.
p288/p288_364|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p288/p288_030|I was an athlete.
p288/p288_365|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p288/p288_039|It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
p288/p288_238|He's got to go.
p288/p288_140|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p288/p288_282|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p288/p288_115|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p288/p288_185|If the director is with you.
p288/p288_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p288/p288_052|Sadly, it can't.
p288/p288_038|I was scared.
p288/p288_222|But it will be sorted out this week.
p288/p288_398|His remarks appear to have had an effect.
p288/p288_219|Mental health is a massive issue.
p288/p288_046|Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
p288/p288_397|Emotions were complex.
p288/p288_310|O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
p288/p288_168|They thought they had found a home.
p288/p288_357|He's very explosive.
p288/p288_069|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p288/p288_356|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p288/p288_259|George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
p288/p288_043|But it might have done.
p288/p288_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p288/p288_402|That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
p288/p288_216|Who was on the panel?
p288/p288_374|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p288/p288_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p288/p288_378|It is a large number.
p288/p288_207|She should not be blamed.
p288/p288_075|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p288/p288_189|Peace was won.
p288/p288_338|The same things will happen with GM foods.
p288/p288_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p288/p288_226|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p288/p288_278|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p288/p288_126|You've got to be vigilant.
p288/p288_076|I've not thought about it.
p288/p288_188|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p288/p288_269|It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
p288/p288_286|This is a national crisis.
p288/p288_083|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p288/p288_412|That may be.
p288/p288_228|The body follows the mind.
p288/p288_314|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p288/p288_050|I guess I was lucky, though.
p288/p288_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p288/p288_078|This is the way things should be handled.
p288/p288_121|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p288/p288_380|Colour was at the core of his life.
p288/p288_274|I am an estate agent.
p288/p288_293|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p288/p288_268|And Michael was just great.
p288/p288_194|The conference is the first test.
p288/p288_137|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p288/p288_369|Who was the mystery MP?
p288/p288_068|That was the easy election.
p288/p288_332|He was then replaced by Ross.
p288/p288_127|The goals were good.
p288/p288_225|I'd never seen a play about me.
p288/p288_294|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p288/p288_192|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p288/p288_317|My whole life has changed.
p288/p288_409|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p288/p288_200|It's all about money, money, money.
p288/p288_164|And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
p288/p288_249|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p288/p288_281|The attacker died in the crash.
p288/p288_337|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p288/p288_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p288/p288_381|I know I'm in a very special position.
p288/p288_091|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p288/p288_108|The fire was above the hole.
p288/p288_319|Hartley should know.
p288/p288_379|I am a wealthy person.
p288/p288_070|Neither it is.
p288/p288_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p288/p288_057|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p288/p288_169|The jury is still out.
p288/p288_320|Kids are terrible.
p288/p288_122|So the European elections are extremely important.
p288/p288_375|We do not get that impression now.
p288/p288_080|It's all going to clear the debt.
p288/p288_360|However, it was well worth the wait.
p288/p288_290|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p288/p288_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p288/p288_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p288/p288_208|Twaddle is a case in point.
p288/p288_191|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p288/p288_148|This latter point is hugely important.
p288/p288_391|Stewart will travel with some confidence.
p288/p288_101|I'm not depressed.
p288/p288_096|It was a good performance.
p288/p288_042|We need to chat.
p288/p288_088|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p288/p288_035|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p288/p288_231|It is set in Paris.
p288/p288_352|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p288/p288_326|There was some merit in that.
p288/p288_089|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p288/p288_395|The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
p288/p288_387|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p288/p288_049|I was lost.
p288/p288_082|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p288/p288_372|Now, though, he has an incentive.
p288/p288_142|A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
p288/p288_095|Journalists should make him.
p288/p288_244|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p288/p288_256|I was happily surprised.
p288/p288_273|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p288/p288_061|They're appalled by that.
p288/p288_211|In each case they were a goal down.
p288/p288_355|The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
p288/p288_106|It is so sad.
p288/p288_253|This is a big club.
p288/p288_220|You have to do your research.
p288/p288_152|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p288/p288_133|Is that Titanic?
p288/p288_230|She hopes to study in Britain one day.
p288/p288_299|However, the snow was welcomed by some.
p288/p288_343|He's been the key to everything.
p288/p288_134|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p288/p288_097|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p288/p288_353|It's good to start with Judith.
p288/p288_130|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p288/p288_307|I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
p288/p288_100|I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
p288/p288_235|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p288/p288_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p288/p288_135|Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
p288/p288_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p288/p288_351|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p288/p288_252|It's a source of deep concern.
p288/p288_411|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p288/p288_291|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p288/p288_215|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p288/p288_384|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p288/p288_128|We never said that we would walk through the third division.
p288/p288_197|They are in the euro.
p288/p288_362|That would help.
p288/p288_305|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p288/p288_347|It was good for us that they lost that day.
p288/p288_272|A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
p288/p288_099|It was an adventure.
p288/p288_201|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p288/p288_270|In fact, they have the opposite effect.
p288/p288_087|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p288/p288_085|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p288/p288_311|We want to play at the worlds.
p288/p288_199|But she might be.
p288/p288_074|Is there a new way forward?
p288/p288_218|We've got the bronze.
p288/p288_341|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p288/p288_366|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p288/p288_348|A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
p288/p288_103|It's in his blood.
p288/p288_393|It is not normal practice.
p288/p288_334|I'd like to take the plunge.
p288/p288_399|He's already made history.
p288/p288_214|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p288/p288_125|I had relied on him.
p288/p288_349|You need a licence to run a pub.
p288/p288_280|He will address the nation this evening.
p288/p288_394|This is a major step forward for carers.
p288/p288_154|I was in the train station overnight.
p288/p288_250|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p288/p288_206|Feel the heat?
p288/p288_117|There were no grounds for his action.
p288/p288_382|Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
p288/p288_156|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p288/p288_090|It is a lifeline.
p288/p288_388|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p288/p288_239|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p288/p288_210|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
p288/p288_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p288/p288_161|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p288/p288_221|We played them off the pitch.
p288/p288_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p288/p288_171|It should be easy.
p288/p288_160|Does that put pressure on us?
p288/p288_037|That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
p288/p288_344|The boat was fantastic.
p288/p288_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p288/p288_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p288/p288_336|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p288/p288_149|Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
p288/p288_166|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p288/p288_205|Saddam Hussein is a devil.
p288/p288_177|It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
p288/p288_041|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p288/p288_251|I told you I was ill.
p288/p288_195|Is that success?
p288/p288_159|They will do their own thing.
p288/p288_262|This is a question of Islam.
p288/p288_094|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p288/p288_053|It's very odd.
p288/p288_275|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p288/p288_261|We shall rely on human beings.
p288/p288_298|I thought it was my only chance.
p288/p288_265|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p288/p288_241|It would appear that it has not been a problem.
p288/p288_322|My body is clearly capable.
p288/p288_147|They were later discharged from hospital.
p288/p288_368|Not so, it seems.
p288/p288_105|We do not expect any surplus.
p288/p288_284|It's like a high school play.
p288/p288_187|We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
p288/p288_180|It just came into my head that day.
p288/p288_267|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p288/p288_034|It was fit for royalty.
p288/p288_350|That has been lost.
p288/p288_040|But it took a lot of bottle.
p288/p288_064|We should have known.
p288/p288_342|These days are long gone.
p288/p288_071|He seemed to lose his focus.
p288/p288_065|The end result is precisely the same.
p288/p288_232|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p288/p288_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p288/p288_301|One was a lawyer.
p288/p288_247|A friendship that will endure.
p288/p288_345|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p288/p288_183|It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
p288/p288_048|It will come all right.
p288/p288_151|I'm just enjoying every match.
p288/p288_385|He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
p288/p288_406|I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
p288/p288_309|It's certainly different.
p288/p288_029|Because we do not need it.
p288/p288_066|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p288/p288_271|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p288/p288_179|It's a joke.
p288/p288_266|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p288/p288_113|It is rubbish.
p288/p288_163|It is a terrible place.
p288/p288_318|They wanted the club to make money.
p288/p288_173|Tony had arrived.
p288/p288_204|This gives a financial incentive to switch.
p288/p288_081|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p288/p288_175|There is no point in looking any further.
p288/p288_373|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p288/p288_084|We have other options.
p288/p288_109|We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
p288/p288_377|It was a funny game.
p288/p288_263|It looks as though he will be right.
p288/p288_092|Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
p288/p288_240|It's too much work.
p288/p288_359|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p288/p288_234|And a film maker was born.
p288/p288_255|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p288/p288_292|Who can predict?
p288/p288_404|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p288/p288_170|It's quite a routine.
p288/p288_257|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p288/p288_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p288/p288_167|He was a crazy man.
p288/p288_031|It is a case of taking a risk.
p288/p288_036|President Bush is at war.
p288/p288_051|I was inspired by two things.
p288/p288_118|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p288/p288_304|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p288/p288_264|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p288/p288_063|Equity declined to comment.
p288/p288_331|We agreed to disagree.
p288/p288_242|A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
p288/p288_285|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p288/p288_279|You've got to have both sides.
p288/p288_330|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p288/p288_111|It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
p288/p288_132|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p288/p288_032|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p288/p288_025|She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
p288/p288_181|They really did a great job.
p288/p288_303|We believe the world has too many refugees already.
p288/p288_098|I didn't play well last year.
p288/p288_112|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p288/p288_058|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p288/p288_104|It had been played at festivals.
p288/p288_158|It is not too late to get on board.
p288/p288_371|The play is based on a real-life event.
p288/p288_001|Please call Stella.
p288/p288_077|People must remain vigilant.
p288/p288_376|They play together perfectly.
p288/p288_124|Well, you can have a tree.
p288/p288_162|It is too much for me.
p288/p288_062|Scotland had great assets.
p288/p288_288|Who did the recruiting?
p288/p288_155|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p288/p288_107|They were behind the wheel.
p288/p288_328|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p288/p288_408|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p288/p288_410|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p288/p288_300|Nothing is safe.
p288/p288_203|Now, it's all right.
p288/p288_327|I came into this world with nothing.
p288/p288_405|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p288/p288_198|I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
p288/p288_138|He should have won.
p288/p288_045|He is too weak to move.
p288/p288_044|Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
p288/p288_237|We have a free vote on these things in our party.
p288/p288_165|Nobody did in those days.
p288/p288_258|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p288/p288_209|It had all been arranged.
p288/p288_193|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p288/p288_114|This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
p288/p288_213|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p288/p288_139|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p288/p288_054|It is unique.
p288/p288_306|It's just not funny!
p288/p288_174|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p288/p288_056|That's the truth.
p288/p288_396|My house was shaking at the time.
p288/p288_190|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p288/p288_400|Then , he laughs.
p288/p288_260|Blood samples were taken.
p288/p288_157|I have got a wife to feed.
p288/p288_060|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p288/p288_229|However, no further action was taken by police.
p288/p288_178|Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
p288/p288_073|It was chaotic.
p288/p288_339|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p288/p288_184|People will ask about us.
p288/p288_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p288/p288_287|The death toll included five children.
p288/p288_047|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p288/p288_136|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p288/p288_033|I think a move would create a lot of interest.
p288/p288_110|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p288/p288_276|It happens from time to time.
p288/p288_370|All the investment is possible through the public sector.
p288/p288_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p288/p288_176|Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
p288/p288_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p288/p288_141|The weather forecast isn't good.
p288/p288_354|There is no room for error.
p288/p288_313|This is the culture change in medicine.
p288/p288_323|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p288/p288_358|We have to move forward.
p288/p288_390|It's like a basketball.
p288/p288_324|I had my suspicions.
p288/p288_227|The track is currently covered in snow.
p288/p288_316|I never thought it would take this long.
p288/p288_116|That's all right then.
p288/p288_223|It was good fun.
p288/p288_150|It was so new, so exciting.
p288/p288_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p243/p243_250|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p243/p243_054|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
p243/p243_123|Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
p243/p243_281|Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
p243/p243_255|Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
p243/p243_397|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p243/p243_041|Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
p243/p243_166|It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
p243/p243_316|A report on their property is due within days.
p243/p243_095|He will be a very hard act to follow.
p243/p243_110|Some young girls also came by last night.
p243/p243_214|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
p243/p243_311|He is keen to stay in public service.
p243/p243_308|Further heavy charges are expected this year.
p243/p243_265|His condition was described as serious last night.
p243/p243_137|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p243/p243_138|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
p243/p243_224|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
p243/p243_373|They know the truth, they really know the truth.
p243/p243_078|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
p243/p243_043|He too started on the subs seats.
p243/p243_274|Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
p243/p243_353|The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
p243/p243_158|They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
p243/p243_362|He's young enough and he must learn.
p243/p243_253|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
p243/p243_119|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
p243/p243_367|The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
p243/p243_129|It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
p243/p243_217|I do not see this so much as failure.
p243/p243_219|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
p243/p243_130|I could live without the attention, he admitted.
p243/p243_057|Her husband had been waiting for her return.
p243/p243_286|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
p243/p243_290|He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
p243/p243_081|I do not attempt to answer that.
p243/p243_200|The police insisted that they were standard issue.
p243/p243_188|I didn't miss the big house at all.
p243/p243_372|He really played us into a corner.
p243/p243_145|All eight victims were based in Germany.
p243/p243_105|I bought a flat six years ago.
p243/p243_026|His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
p243/p243_060|It was a day she thought she would never see.
p243/p243_247|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
p243/p243_086|Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
p243/p243_339|So is that it, then?
p243/p243_257|Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
p243/p243_341|Put another way, they just won't do it.
p243/p243_172|He said some things which were better left alone.
p243/p243_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p243/p243_346|It was a bit like having children.
p243/p243_066|Do not give your details to anyone.
p243/p243_266|The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
p243/p243_340|Do I have a favourite?
p243/p243_374|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
p243/p243_097|Put simply, it goes something like this.
p243/p243_302|And does it?
p243/p243_267|The board do not own the company.
p243/p243_128|We have to offer value for money.
p243/p243_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p243/p243_148|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p243/p243_294|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p243/p243_090|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p243/p243_321|This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
p243/p243_398|People have a wish to charge twice.
p243/p243_349|I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
p243/p243_391|My tax affairs have been totally open.
p243/p243_333|These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
p243/p243_171|You need a long-term strategy in football.
p243/p243_108|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
p243/p243_270|Its primary business channel is the internet.
p243/p243_102|We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
p243/p243_079|The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
p243/p243_035|It is about control of our economy.
p243/p243_186|A great player has to win major championships.
p243/p243_377|The direct effects on trade will be limited.
p243/p243_258|Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
p243/p243_070|But during the bid process, that changed completely.
p243/p243_357|It is the only natural British site on the list.
p243/p243_259|Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
p243/p243_390|His record on Government has always been highly effective.
p243/p243_063|There were no details of the other five victims.
p243/p243_155|Time may already have run out for this option.
p243/p243_327|I try to be open to experience.
p243/p243_249|My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
p243/p243_264|The two companies were not for sale.
p243/p243_369|We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
p243/p243_263|The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
p243/p243_032|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
p243/p243_276|Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
p243/p243_361|The institute board will take the decision.
p243/p243_197|What was the matter for concern?
p243/p243_393|But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
p243/p243_094|There is no issue of national security involved here.
p243/p243_324|It is not either national standards or local control.
p243/p243_344|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
p243/p243_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p243/p243_306|Are you going to win?
p243/p243_212|It is going to change the world.
p243/p243_363|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
p243/p243_248|The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
p243/p243_300|So, did she meet him?
p243/p243_085|No plan for projects are yet in place.
p243/p243_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p243/p243_382|The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
p243/p243_116|Had this been common practice?
p243/p243_098|Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
p243/p243_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p243/p243_325|His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
p243/p243_174|The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
p243/p243_222|We are still seeking that complete performance.
p243/p243_077|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
p243/p243_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p243/p243_089|I feel I did not have enough time.
p243/p243_275|It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
p243/p243_029|The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
p243/p243_395|In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
p243/p243_320|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
p243/p243_221|We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
p243/p243_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p243/p243_272|The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
p243/p243_179|Nato has left them with no other option.
p243/p243_213|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
p243/p243_064|It also has a good labour supply.
p243/p243_381|This is not a small amount of money.
p243/p243_184|We have come a long way since then.
p243/p243_370|I have come here to show support for the families.
p243/p243_304|Had I heard?
p243/p243_040|Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
p243/p243_185|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
p243/p243_254|I'd rather play well next week than here.
p243/p243_181|Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
p243/p243_303|Are you from the rugby?
p243/p243_044|Is it worth it?
p243/p243_025|He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
p243/p243_169|We had to work very hard for our points.
p243/p243_136|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
p243/p243_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p243/p243_230|This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
p243/p243_159|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
p243/p243_180|I am secure in my own position.
p243/p243_176|Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
p243/p243_187|Highland health board has a responsibility here.
p243/p243_243|Does the name matter?
p243/p243_109|Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
p243/p243_336|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
p243/p243_122|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p243/p243_332|I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
p243/p243_046|How do you take them away?
p243/p243_356|The deal is expected to be completed by September.
p243/p243_228|Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
p243/p243_082|It's been a great evening for us.
p243/p243_245|What are you not good at?
p243/p243_049|Has the conflict started?
p243/p243_238|The children were later able to leave by bus.
p243/p243_069|I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
p243/p243_160|A progress report will be published in October.
p243/p243_113|Is there a waiting list?
p243/p243_216|I am not going to judge them.
p243/p243_065|Indeed he has a lot of output.
p243/p243_296|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p243/p243_261|Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
p243/p243_083|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p243/p243_280|The life office will now stay with Abbey.
p243/p243_048|After the match, do you?
p243/p243_288|No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
p243/p243_385|Why do it otherwise?
p243/p243_305|What happened in that game?
p243/p243_282|Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
p243/p243_207|I want an answer from the British Government.
p243/p243_226|If not, a deal could take many months.
p243/p243_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p243/p243_277|I think the shares are good value.
p243/p243_167|However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
p243/p243_345|Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
p243/p243_121|They have no real friends in the region.
p243/p243_189|The story was not made public by this club.
p243/p243_268|Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
p243/p243_151|Does that put pressure on us?
p243/p243_388|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
p243/p243_168|I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
p243/p243_331|Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
p243/p243_195|And they were being paid?
p243/p243_396|We are keen to see truth and justice.
p243/p243_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p243/p243_215|The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
p243/p243_375|Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
p243/p243_061|Talks have continued at many different levels.
p243/p243_093|They had the appeal of TV stars.
p243/p243_205|Hague will be leader at the election after next.
p243/p243_114|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p243/p243_380|This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
p243/p243_314|He felt too close to head office.
p243/p243_343|Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
p243/p243_087|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
p243/p243_229|I want to see as much progress as possible.
p243/p243_156|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
p243/p243_284|The fans pay for their season tickets.
p243/p243_241|Why change it?
p243/p243_112|What are they for?
p243/p243_309|It happened on average once a week this year.
p243/p243_045|Does it matter?
p243/p243_287|Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
p243/p243_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p243/p243_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p243/p243_312|Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
p243/p243_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p243/p243_283|He may be ready for first team action in March.
p243/p243_141|I am not under any new pressure.
p243/p243_165|But the game is still wide open.
p243/p243_365|Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
p243/p243_386|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p243/p243_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p243/p243_203|Full details are expected to be released in June.
p243/p243_279|Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
p243/p243_291|He would get into any world team.
p243/p243_126|So I am going in the right direction.
p243/p243_062|The referee is there to decide these things.
p243/p243_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p243/p243_364|Both players gave so much to the side.
p243/p243_027|I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
p243/p243_293|They first met during a Step in London.
p243/p243_154|Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
p243/p243_103|We were under a bit of pressure.
p243/p243_322|We will not simply hit these people.
p243/p243_223|My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
p243/p243_376|It used to be all hard sell.
p243/p243_328|He is not exactly a pretty child.
p243/p243_289|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
p243/p243_313|For that reason cover should not be given.
p243/p243_084|A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
p243/p243_001|Please call Stella.
p243/p243_162|That will reduce my chance of selection.
p243/p243_106|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
p243/p243_371|We have been going for three years.
p243/p243_310|This is the version which appeared in our paper.
p243/p243_088|Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
p243/p243_298|It is based on population rather than need.
p243/p243_335|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
p243/p243_323|We still think this trade is on the increase.
p243/p243_042|He does not even trust his own members.
p243/p243_194|Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
p243/p243_242|What do we want to do that for?
p243/p243_096|Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
p243/p243_236|That is the last thing they need.
p243/p243_354|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p243/p243_347|And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
p243/p243_208|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
p243/p243_317|He will just go on doing his job.
p243/p243_164|Surely it can't run for two years.
p243/p243_178|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p243/p243_182|She is believed to be in South Africa.
p243/p243_337|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p243/p243_206|He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
p243/p243_170|That is a big risk at any price.
p243/p243_133|No country has a similar training programme.
p243/p243_301|So what is the campaign about?
p243/p243_052|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
p243/p243_146|Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
p243/p243_163|When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
p243/p243_297|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p243/p243_358|His style was direct and very human.
p243/p243_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p243/p243_271|That's been the difference between the sides.
p243/p243_389|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p243/p243_067|He was failed by his health authority.
p243/p243_348|And that is the bottom line - box office.
p243/p243_059|We just want this season to end.
p243/p243_352|Sales will begin by the end of October.
p243/p243_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p243/p243_378|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
p243/p243_115|So what happens next?
p243/p243_050|Have I really come to this?
p243/p243_038|He added that her comments were noted.
p243/p243_073|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
p243/p243_199|There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
p243/p243_183|The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
p243/p243_055|Andy was a huge influence yet again.
p243/p243_231|I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
p243/p243_269|They always want to give a performance.
p243/p243_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p243/p243_256|The British Government should follow the Irish example.
p243/p243_117|What do they want us to do?
p243/p243_225|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
p243/p243_292|Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
p243/p243_147|You should feel involved in their lives.
p243/p243_034|But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
p243/p243_099|Even if he doesn't have any lines.
p243/p243_161|This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
p243/p243_033|I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
p243/p243_076|It had little effect on European equity markets.
p243/p243_232|The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
p243/p243_091|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
p243/p243_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p243/p243_144|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
p243/p243_326|I feel as if I can hole everything now.
p243/p243_379|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p243/p243_260|And they never show the same film as a rival.
p243/p243_329|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
p243/p243_201|One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
p243/p243_233|They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
p243/p243_120|It is the right package for Scotland.
p243/p243_153|Do you think we are a top nation?
p243/p243_053|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
p243/p243_262|There would be a north and south division.
p243/p243_135|Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
p243/p243_384|What do we do?
p243/p243_118|The idea is the shop within a shop.
p243/p243_173|If successful, several records will be made.
p243/p243_111|Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
p243/p243_175|It didn't come as any great surprise.
p243/p243_244|how do you get it back?
p243/p243_068|But it was not all bad news.
p243/p243_234|The labour side has developed in the North area.
p243/p243_125|I think there's not much between them.
p243/p243_359|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
p243/p243_051|I'm as fit as I can get.
p243/p243_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p243/p243_104|They won't actually make any money from it.
p243/p243_131|He's got to look after himself now.
p243/p243_392|Five years ago its return was rejected.
p243/p243_127|Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
p243/p243_142|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
p243/p243_237|He has worked for several years in the United States.
p243/p243_318|I always felt they played for me.
p243/p243_071|It turned me against the whole system.
p243/p243_134|There is no future in rock music.
p243/p243_080|They said our costs were too high.
p243/p243_246|I think, therefore I am?
p243/p243_157|When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
p243/p243_075|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
p243/p243_355|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
p243/p243_299|He could understand both points of view.
p243/p243_218|A European final must be the millennium target.
p243/p243_240|Was it the wife?
p243/p243_100|I am delighted to hear this news.
p243/p243_235|You are not allowed to do that.
p243/p243_278|One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
p243/p243_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p243/p243_132|He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
p243/p243_177|It's just a different way of life.
p243/p243_273|I think I was about four years old.
p243/p243_342|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
p243/p243_210|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p243/p243_295|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p243/p243_039|She will get through it I'm sure.
p243/p243_368|It was a goal which came from nothing.
p243/p243_330|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
p243/p243_140|There was only one living room, you see.
p243/p243_056|They seem too much of a sure thing.
p243/p243_193|It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
p243/p243_074|But two groups refused to sign up.
p243/p243_360|They have the cash and the fire power.
p243/p243_315|If you believe in the blue and white.
p243/p243_143|It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
p243/p243_239|Jim was down there with his wife.
p243/p243_190|That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
p243/p243_092|Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
p243/p243_387|The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
p243/p243_227|This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
p243/p243_366|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p243/p243_196|was everything done to save people?
p243/p243_149|Is it in the right place?
p243/p243_251|However, the figures tell a different story.
p243/p243_047|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p243/p243_209|They are a victim of their own success.
p243/p243_058|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p243/p243_037|That was not perfect golf by any means.
p243/p243_107|They are a different team at home.
p243/p243_319|That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
p243/p243_101|We are already seeing some positive results.
p243/p243_211|This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
p243/p243_252|The rise has come too late for some.
p243/p243_198|But they had to be paid for.
p243/p243_383|I just felt that I was broken down.
p243/p243_139|The programme has been made with great care.
p243/p243_204|As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
p243/p243_202|I've never had a year like this.
p243/p243_191|You are not long home from work.
p243/p243_152|Did it work?
p243/p243_334|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
p243/p243_036|Each brand was owned by a different family.
p243/p243_192|I am fighting the force of nature.
p243/p243_031|Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
p243/p243_220|I was independent but I am not now.
p243/p243_028|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
p243/p243_338|How are you, sir?
p243/p243_350|I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
p243/p243_394|In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
p243/p243_150|Did he trip?
p243/p243_072|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
p243/p243_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p243/p243_030|She brought a lot to my life.
p258/p258_405|They are not left wing.
p258/p258_346|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p258/p258_366|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p258/p258_340|They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
p258/p258_096|Oil embargo endorsed.
p258/p258_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p258/p258_254|We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
p258/p258_356|A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
p258/p258_148|My Dad is a hero.
p258/p258_029|Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
p258/p258_098|Before the game we went for a pint.
p258/p258_126|Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
p258/p258_166|They thought they had found a home.
p258/p258_200|A deadline is still essential.
p258/p258_355|He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
p258/p258_264|It is also very valuable.
p258/p258_120|There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
p258/p258_142|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p258/p258_396|I suspect the latter.
p258/p258_171|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p258/p258_162|I lost my head.
p258/p258_245|You can feel at home in China.
p258/p258_240|Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
p258/p258_110|This film will be totally awesome.
p258/p258_145|The FBI could become involved.
p258/p258_316|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p258/p258_106|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
p258/p258_217|He seemed to lose his focus.
p258/p258_334|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p258/p258_347|The composer will conduct.
p258/p258_194|It's the same old story.
p258/p258_066|The price cuts are really exciting.
p258/p258_250|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p258/p258_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p258/p258_298|The home was now under new management.
p258/p258_209|She should not be blamed.
p258/p258_251|I didn't need to watch it on the video.
p258/p258_032|He took me on a tour of the wards.
p258/p258_221|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p258/p258_351|Eight months later, he was dead.
p258/p258_379|Not because they want to sing about something.
p258/p258_141|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p258/p258_289|It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
p258/p258_338|I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
p258/p258_391|There is a solution, she believes.
p258/p258_336|They haven't got a hope.
p258/p258_393|One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
p258/p258_408|He scored a touchdown.
p258/p258_036|It is not for any other purpose.
p258/p258_210|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p258/p258_256|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p258/p258_246|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
p258/p258_138|We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
p258/p258_223|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p258/p258_259|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p258/p258_295|A new school will be built.
p258/p258_044|As she explains.
p258/p258_065|It's all I can do.
p258/p258_107|It is so sad.
p258/p258_329|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p258/p258_388|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p258/p258_147|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p258/p258_345|Nobody else was with me.
p258/p258_081|Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
p258/p258_089|She's got to say something.
p258/p258_255|Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
p258/p258_395|Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
p258/p258_237|It's quite nice.
p258/p258_236|Well, they were the unlucky ones.
p258/p258_216|I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
p258/p258_277|They were all in a stable condition last night.
p258/p258_199|But she might be.
p258/p258_378|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p258/p258_399|It was a breathtaking moment.
p258/p258_037|President Bush is at war.
p258/p258_001|Please call Stella.
p258/p258_320|My body is clearly capable.
p258/p258_206|The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
p258/p258_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p258/p258_040|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p258/p258_268|That's the only thing I will say.
p258/p258_285|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p258/p258_333|Robert is a special talent.
p258/p258_185|It is a terrible loss.
p258/p258_407|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p258/p258_105|We do not expect any surplus.
p258/p258_102|She has been shot.
p258/p258_281|He has a wealth of experience.
p258/p258_361|Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
p258/p258_053|That is very hard, alone.
p258/p258_368|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p258/p258_327|I came into this world with nothing.
p258/p258_179|Four policemen were wounded.
p258/p258_343|There's no place to hide.
p258/p258_400|The car was just there.
p258/p258_070|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
p258/p258_038|I was scared.
p258/p258_385|It is a temptation which should be resisted.
p258/p258_230|My wife and family are the support system.
p258/p258_117|You can spend money on housing.
p258/p258_319|The problems began a long time ago.
p258/p258_228|I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
p258/p258_374|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p258/p258_410|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p258/p258_174|There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
p258/p258_235|They should come forward.
p258/p258_269|Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
p258/p258_072|This is the way things should be handled.
p258/p258_305|Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
p258/p258_332|I'd like to take the plunge.
p258/p258_026|It's nice to hear.
p258/p258_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p258/p258_165|That will do for me.
p258/p258_027|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p258/p258_184|We want to help them through it.
p258/p258_114|This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
p258/p258_189|It's very difficult to find a buyer.
p258/p258_404|Then , he laughs.
p258/p258_380|Colour was at the core of his life.
p258/p258_315|They were fantastic.
p258/p258_078|Nothing is yet confirmed.
p258/p258_300|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p258/p258_390|YOU thought it was a headache.
p258/p258_348|His contract was then not renewed.
p258/p258_224|It's so special.
p258/p258_121|I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
p258/p258_167|I always felt they played for me.
p258/p258_164|Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
p258/p258_112|Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
p258/p258_263|Today we can say that a new era has begun.
p258/p258_261|I am very angry.
p258/p258_086|Until you hit the big games.
p258/p258_371|He could make it.
p258/p258_364|It was fit for royalty.
p258/p258_054|It's that kind of place.
p258/p258_412|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p258/p258_273|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p258/p258_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p258/p258_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p258/p258_211|It had all been arranged.
p258/p258_169|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p258/p258_186|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p258/p258_271|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p258/p258_140|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p258/p258_226|What was the main difference?
p258/p258_046|He looks like an Afghan.
p258/p258_128|Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
p258/p258_413|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p258/p258_154|They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
p258/p258_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p258/p258_253|Her presence was almost everywhere.
p258/p258_094|But it was a pleasure.
p258/p258_122|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p258/p258_118|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p258/p258_160|We try to keep it right.
p258/p258_202|It was worth a photograph.
p258/p258_056|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p258/p258_308|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p258/p258_369|I feel pretty good.
p258/p258_095|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p258/p258_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p258/p258_335|There was no option.
p258/p258_274|It is the same in Sweden.
p258/p258_252|He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
p258/p258_363|That would help.
p258/p258_079|New Zealand rugby is totally different.
p258/p258_278|It's a way of life.
p258/p258_197|Ferguson should take note.
p258/p258_233|They had no children.
p258/p258_382|It was a cry for help.
p258/p258_294|Sunday's game was not a trial.
p258/p258_337|He did a good job.
p258/p258_225|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p258/p258_101|They had to be cut from the wreckage.
p258/p258_080|We have other options.
p258/p258_286|This is a national crisis.
p258/p258_132|They made such decisions in London.
p258/p258_176|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p258/p258_302|One was a lawyer.
p258/p258_213|His third goal was superb.
p258/p258_198|They've got three-quarters of the way.
p258/p258_357|It was very formal.
p258/p258_139|Is that Titanic?
p258/p258_203|It's a mixture of everything.
p258/p258_229|They are the innocent victims.
p258/p258_377|Well, the big day has arrived.
p258/p258_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p258/p258_084|They are different types.
p258/p258_358|The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
p258/p258_131|It plans to return to this field.
p258/p258_152|These days are long gone.
p258/p258_234|We are in the hat.
p258/p258_212|A Grampian Police spokesman said.
p258/p258_276|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p258/p258_157|Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
p258/p258_214|It's not ideal.
p258/p258_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p258/p258_183|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p258/p258_394|This year I understood.
p258/p258_260|I was in jail for five years.
p258/p258_143|You know the type.
p258/p258_353|I saw some good things.
p258/p258_052|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p258/p258_257|They are interior designers and architects.
p258/p258_149|The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
p258/p258_262|They must play for each other.
p258/p258_354|The salary changes are long overdue.
p258/p258_220|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p258/p258_076|I first met him last summer.
p258/p258_266|It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
p258/p258_071|He got the same story.
p258/p258_309|It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
p258/p258_127|Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
p258/p258_303|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p258/p258_055|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p258/p258_360|No other job in world football can compare to this one.
p258/p258_248|I was shocked.
p258/p258_342|I've got no secret.
p258/p258_307|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p258/p258_083|Today I couldn't run on it.
p258/p258_352|A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
p258/p258_113|I joined a group.
p258/p258_244|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p258/p258_383|Something is wrong.
p258/p258_304|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p258/p258_051|We have not given up hope.
p258/p258_042|We need to chat.
p258/p258_058|It should be devolved.
p258/p258_103|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p258/p258_318|It should be equal.
p258/p258_301|Nothing is safe.
p258/p258_204|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p258/p258_370|I am a star.
p258/p258_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p258/p258_158|We have to move forward.
p258/p258_341|Indeed, it was magical.
p258/p258_398|He is on the wrong side.
p258/p258_137|If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
p258/p258_192|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p258/p258_191|The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
p258/p258_350|It is long gone.
p258/p258_146|The weather forecast isn't good.
p258/p258_161|It's that sort of night.
p258/p258_324|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p258/p258_172|If that's the case, he will struggle.
p258/p258_033|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p258/p258_170|IT S the real thing, for sure.
p258/p258_389|I was so nervous.
p258/p258_344|Tiger is the exception.
p258/p258_087|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p258/p258_064|That was the easy election.
p258/p258_282|It's so awful.
p258/p258_049|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p258/p258_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p258/p258_144|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p258/p258_325|However, the groups denied the claims.
p258/p258_150|Neither side can win this war.
p258/p258_284|I intended to look for another club on loan.
p258/p258_227|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p258/p258_397|These guys are looking for business.
p258/p258_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p258/p258_242|It is hard won.
p258/p258_401|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p258/p258_326|There was some merit in that.
p258/p258_231|Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
p258/p258_168|Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
p258/p258_196|Is that success?
p258/p258_293|It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
p258/p258_155|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p258/p258_133|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p258/p258_153|I've put my own money into this project.
p258/p258_375|It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
p258/p258_291|The results are sometimes contentious.
p258/p258_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p258/p258_272|Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
p258/p258_187|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p258/p258_311|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p258/p258_039|It will come all right.
p258/p258_362|We will be homeless.
p258/p258_091|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p258/p258_050|That's the day job.
p258/p258_134|My conscience is not clear.
p258/p258_349|I got a yellow card.
p258/p258_339|It was so new, so exciting.
p258/p258_409|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p258/p258_060|Try to save us.
p258/p258_280|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p258/p258_067|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p258/p258_297|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p258/p258_045|She looked so young.
p258/p258_061|He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
p258/p258_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p258/p258_279|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p258/p258_124|It's terrible that he has died the same way.
p258/p258_156|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p258/p258_097|It is a good lifestyle.
p258/p258_175|I drove the ball well.
p258/p258_062|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p258/p258_306|This is a war over our home.
p258/p258_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p258/p258_111|Maybe this battle has been.
p258/p258_130|The role was perfect for Russell.
p258/p258_057|He was popular.
p258/p258_392|However, it's good to turn the page.
p258/p258_215|We want to keep the pound.
p258/p258_123|She does not want to speak.
p258/p258_074|It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
p258/p258_387|That's the name of the game, though.
p258/p258_159|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p258/p258_384|It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
p258/p258_195|It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
p258/p258_028|They should be so lucky.
p258/p258_411|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p258/p258_386|That team is due to be announced this morning.
p258/p258_372|I thought he was my friend.
p258/p258_099|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p258/p258_292|These figures are truly awful.
p258/p258_208|He is slightly confused.
p258/p258_258|Chelsea was a great club.
p258/p258_238|Hospitals are for the ill.
p258/p258_322|He said she was mad.
p258/p258_151|Was this element always there?
p258/p258_135|I am totally devoted to this job.
p258/p258_090|The selection process is still at a very early stage.
p258/p258_367|He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
p258/p258_181|We did everything by the book.
p258/p258_031|Because we do not need it.
p258/p258_125|So the European elections are extremely important.
p258/p258_265|He thought he had a month to cross the street.
p258/p258_059|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p258/p258_201|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p258/p258_205|We have an election in eight days.
p258/p258_373|He could face a jail sentence.
p258/p258_178|They will run a mile.
p258/p258_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p258/p258_093|Journalists should make him.
p258/p258_312|He will go a long way.
p258/p258_321|Referees are easy targets.
p258/p258_330|Off with their heads.
p258/p258_073|It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
p258/p258_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p258/p258_328|It is a strong case.
p258/p258_243|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p258/p258_173|It should be easy.
p258/p258_290|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p258/p258_030|However, the following year the cancer returned.
p258/p258_239|The problem in Norway is outside the National.
p258/p258_331|I am so upset.
p258/p258_193|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p258/p258_034|I'd like to continue that record.
p258/p258_035|It was clear.
p258/p258_129|The move has provoked a mixed response.
p258/p258_403|My house was shaking at the time.
p258/p258_247|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p258/p258_365|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p258/p258_381|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p258/p258_188|If the director is with you.
p258/p258_136|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p258/p258_313|We want to play at the worlds.
p258/p258_047|It is the whole package.
p258/p258_414|Also, it is the season of goodwill.
p258/p258_119|Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
p258/p258_249|I should think so, too.
p258/p258_104|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p258/p258_041|The judge said.
p258/p258_068|The girls are so lucky to be alive.
p258/p258_063|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p258/p258_069|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p258/p258_283|For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
p258/p258_314|Scotland were beaten again.
p258/p258_088|There was no rescue.
p258/p258_402|It is full-scale.
p258/p258_323|It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
p258/p258_359|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p258/p258_182|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p258/p258_267|I saw one body.
p258/p258_048|I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
p258/p258_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p258/p258_376|We knew we had the goal we wanted.
p258/p258_180|They receive a high profile in the media.
p258/p258_075|However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
p258/p258_082|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p258/p258_108|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p258/p258_232|They tried to give her advice.
p258/p258_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p258/p258_288|He was obviously very genuine.
p258/p258_222|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p258/p258_219|His death was a tragic accident.
p258/p258_092|Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
p258/p258_406|A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
p258/p258_310|It's certainly different.
p258/p258_116|It is a delight on every level.
p258/p258_077|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p258/p258_218|I might come back.
p258/p258_100|It's not perfect.
p258/p258_043|It's a blessing.
p258/p258_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p258/p258_177|I've been there.
p258/p258_287|The death toll included five children.
p258/p258_270|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p258/p258_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p258/p258_275|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p258/p258_241|They are all bright and different.
p258/p258_115|Who would have?
p258/p258_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p258/p258_296|The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
p258/p258_190|I grew up listening to these people.
p258/p258_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p258/p258_299|Graeme was prepared.
p258/p258_085|It is a simple equation.
p258/p258_317|Kids are terrible.
p258/p258_207|Feel the heat?
p258/p258_163|It is not too late to get on board.
p236/p236_337|In his absence, the council adopted the change.
p236/p236_468|The bill would be massive.
p236/p236_491|Our fans have been marvellous.
p236/p236_132|They could use a boost.
p236/p236_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p236/p236_030|And we have a singer.
p236/p236_178|So what happens next?
p236/p236_416|I never had a childhood.
p236/p236_103|It's not a lack of effort.
p236/p236_446|Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
p236/p236_208|Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
p236/p236_046|He looks like an Afghan.
p236/p236_383|A review is under way.
p236/p236_263|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p236/p236_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p236/p236_047|Everything else is a bonus.
p236/p236_065|The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
p236/p236_185|It is not either national standards or local control.
p236/p236_265|You can feel at home in China.
p236/p236_234|His third goal was superb.
p236/p236_377|I understand the frustration of the fans.
p236/p236_445|Taxes may need to rise.
p236/p236_025|A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
p236/p236_190|It makes no influence on the public.
p236/p236_072|These people are not big names.
p236/p236_133|She died at her home.
p236/p236_433|However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
p236/p236_291|My body is a wreck.
p236/p236_095|I had a ball today.
p236/p236_201|It shows the strength of the roots.
p236/p236_151|It was by the numbers.
p236/p236_480|It is a vicious circle.
p236/p236_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p236/p236_367|The work with Alison was a great experience.
p236/p236_456|They were not even allowed to see them.
p236/p236_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p236/p236_042|Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
p236/p236_238|This will secure the future of our industry.
p236/p236_481|He will be advised by me.
p236/p236_339|The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
p236/p236_113|You can spend money on housing.
p236/p236_059|But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
p236/p236_081|We have turned the corner.
p236/p236_441|The damage is all inside.
p236/p236_224|Which isn't a bad idea.
p236/p236_312|It was really very frightening.
p236/p236_471|He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
p236/p236_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p236/p236_281|They must play for each other.
p236/p236_045|We are working on it.
p236/p236_256|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p236/p236_361|From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
p236/p236_378|On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
p236/p236_350|A great deal has been achieved.
p236/p236_478|These people attack the core of my beliefs.
p236/p236_324|And he goes with it.
p236/p236_396|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p236/p236_116|In addition, investor choice is reduced.
p236/p236_217|John Daly has a burning ambition.
p236/p236_085|Change will however have to be in euros.
p236/p236_472|We live by the rule of law.
p236/p236_041|I needed a change, a new challenge.
p236/p236_415|I've got my own ideas.
p236/p236_169|It opens the door to the Champions League.
p236/p236_077|By then, he was walking on water.
p236/p236_229|Death is outside the language.
p236/p236_100|Our house was very small.
p236/p236_412|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p236/p236_168|Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
p236/p236_384|They know it'll be fantastic.
p236/p236_187|The hotel was now for sale.
p236/p236_307|The rescue package is public money.
p236/p236_137|Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
p236/p236_443|We would have concerns about that.
p236/p236_114|The hearing was due to continue today.
p236/p236_044|But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
p236/p236_289|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p236/p236_061|The tournament has now been cancelled.
p236/p236_111|The result is a vacuum.
p236/p236_306|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p236/p236_158|We did what we had to do.
p236/p236_354|Why do it otherwise?
p236/p236_260|It is very hard for her.
p236/p236_373|Everything is now in place for Manchester.
p236/p236_204|We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
p236/p236_347|We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
p236/p236_080|They lived for their children.
p236/p236_395|I should think so, too.
p236/p236_212|They have the cash and the fire power.
p236/p236_295|And that match was played in June.
p236/p236_233|It had all been arranged.
p236/p236_191|Each case is treated on merit.
p236/p236_477|Analysts said the offer was fair.
p236/p236_454|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p236/p236_277|We run within the law.
p236/p236_303|Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
p236/p236_097|That time is not now, however.
p236/p236_402|We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
p236/p236_104|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p236/p236_078|He was just a journalist.
p236/p236_483|We had to add value.
p236/p236_236|I am considered a teenager.
p236/p236_222|It was worth a photograph.
p236/p236_152|It would seem a natural progression.
p236/p236_262|It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
p236/p236_332|These days will be back.
p236/p236_287|Blair also had a penalty.
p236/p236_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p236/p236_390|She is in their hands.
p236/p236_196|They need to look after themselves.
p236/p236_326|This is a historic occasion.
p236/p236_267|The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
p236/p236_444|I know the worry over Iraq.
p236/p236_237|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p236/p236_369|We are a Scottish company.
p236/p236_327|This ruling is a farce.
p236/p236_329|I am not obsessed with sex.
p236/p236_372|We used to keep our business rates.
p236/p236_345|Three years ago he would have been.
p236/p236_496|They never gave up hope.
p236/p236_448|No options are excluded at all.
p236/p236_101|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p236/p236_476|I am a committed European.
p236/p236_417|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p236/p236_071|It looks like a hit.
p236/p236_318|They have to be addressed.
p236/p236_434|But you can go beyond that condition.
p236/p236_213|The service from the other players was super.
p236/p236_249|Do I think about them often?
p236/p236_292|She failed in her action.
p236/p236_487|We have to go for a win.
p236/p236_073|This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
p236/p236_429|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p236/p236_276|We accept the new rules.
p236/p236_447|Phil Mickelson did that last year.
p236/p236_098|We created so many chances.
p236/p236_450|We are going for it.
p236/p236_195|As many as the market will support.
p236/p236_028|Because we do not need it.
p236/p236_355|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p236/p236_162|I have got a wife to feed.
p236/p236_250|That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
p236/p236_139|That view has not altered.
p236/p236_399|Do I have a favourite?
p236/p236_364|She said they would appeal.
p236/p236_311|We can work all night.
p236/p236_398|So is that it, then?
p236/p236_451|Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
p236/p236_245|Truth is the child of time.
p236/p236_075|The Festival is prepared to help.
p236/p236_194|I had too much to drink.
p236/p236_494|It was still there, but right at the end.
p236/p236_031|He was jailed for four years.
p236/p236_159|It's not like us.
p236/p236_165|We have a budget in March.
p236/p236_430|We've got a good management record.
p236/p236_358|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p236/p236_186|City sentiment is in his favour.
p236/p236_348|The confidence isn't there now.
p236/p236_147|We have a clean bill of health.
p236/p236_458|And it covers the spectrum.
p236/p236_148|Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
p236/p236_094|The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
p236/p236_440|But by that time, it was too late.
p236/p236_501|Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
p236/p236_203|This youngster is so exciting!
p236/p236_419|They were not complacent in any way.
p236/p236_230|I had relied on him.
p236/p236_482|Winning a medal is a dream.
p236/p236_455|He deserved a red card.
p236/p236_427|It is a case of pity for us.
p236/p236_404|I remain a buyer of the shares.
p236/p236_166|He is not a team captain.
p236/p236_333|You may have a short memory.
p236/p236_062|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p236/p236_060|I have proved that in the past.
p236/p236_460|The chief constable has retired.
p236/p236_335|There was no time scale.
p236/p236_392|However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
p236/p236_411|The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
p236/p236_193|Says the Duke of York.
p236/p236_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p236/p236_257|I was just a kid.
p236/p236_266|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p236/p236_200|I had a train to catch.
p236/p236_034|He works at the airport.
p236/p236_452|It is a cause for concern.
p236/p236_125|Something will be done by corporate bodies.
p236/p236_449|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p236/p236_055|We felt it was sufficient.
p236/p236_285|They can leave at any time.
p236/p236_469|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p236/p236_432|Paris is not only young.
p236/p236_102|It became difficult for me.
p236/p236_112|I've heard this stuff about the markets.
p236/p236_049|This is the interesting part.
p236/p236_305|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p236/p236_027|Meetings will also remain private.
p236/p236_438|I chose to make a film.
p236/p236_131|We will try to find someone.
p236/p236_322|I can live with it.
p236/p236_278|We have the moral high ground.
p236/p236_308|I was there five months ago.
p236/p236_414|My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
p236/p236_387|Motion described it as a unique event.
p236/p236_271|However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
p236/p236_109|New Year will be very busy.
p236/p236_241|They said that they stood by their statement.
p236/p236_423|It is an absolute nonsense.
p236/p236_360|They have broken that promise.
p236/p236_420|They did the right thing.
p236/p236_074|We did it for the jersey.
p236/p236_462|It is a crisis, without a doubt.
p236/p236_400|It certainly appeared that way.
p236/p236_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p236/p236_121|He is a lovely man.
p236/p236_053|We keep an eye on it.
p236/p236_503|Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
p236/p236_188|We are the gateway to justice.
p236/p236_371|The pair are very much in love.
p236/p236_149|I was shaking on the blocks.
p236/p236_479|Then came the farewell to Europe.
p236/p236_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p236/p236_239|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p236/p236_299|how do you get it back?
p236/p236_033|This is a central issue.
p236/p236_036|If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
p236/p236_143|The whole industry is a shambles.
p236/p236_084|However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
p236/p236_070|He was seen as the enemy.
p236/p236_421|He will be judged by his actions.
p236/p236_254|Those overseas offices were great.
p236/p236_282|Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
p236/p236_296|I saw it at a ruck.
p236/p236_037|It carried a double message.
p236/p236_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p236/p236_356|So, did she meet him?
p236/p236_040|The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
p236/p236_473|They make a selective perception process.
p236/p236_130|I love the spectacle of cinema.
p236/p236_269|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p236/p236_068|Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
p236/p236_293|Stephen will get his first cap.
p236/p236_215|Tommy is not a problem.
p236/p236_362|It's only a matter of scale.
p236/p236_126|He said to give a local injection.
p236/p236_319|It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
p236/p236_038|That means an extra two years.
p236/p236_489|Something has got to change.
p236/p236_156|It was a funny feeling.
p236/p236_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p236/p236_325|The law will take its course.
p236/p236_408|The trick is to try it.
p236/p236_413|He is on the wrong side.
p236/p236_500|A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
p236/p236_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p236/p236_465|I was all image and no substance.
p236/p236_052|That was the difference today.
p236/p236_259|It was quite a new prescription.
p236/p236_302|It's all designed to speed up the service.
p236/p236_039|That was the case with David.
p236/p236_497|He had planned to sell it.
p236/p236_214|The early physical reports were clear.
p236/p236_243|We played them off the pitch.
p236/p236_264|Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
p236/p236_225|There is no quick fix.
p236/p236_172|It's nice to be nice.
p236/p236_153|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p236/p236_498|I was ready for this.
p236/p236_268|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p236/p236_232|I'm just a regular person.
p236/p236_223|They are looking at a flotation.
p236/p236_425|Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
p236/p236_091|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p236/p236_123|I was on a roll.
p236/p236_484|That is the bottom line.
p236/p236_351|He had no previous convictions.
p236/p236_119|Which can happen any time.
p236/p236_352|Alex Ferguson is the same.
p236/p236_211|This will be our new beginning.
p236/p236_457|And she is very clear on this.
p236/p236_397|How are you, sir?
p236/p236_353|What do we do?
p236/p236_459|Dennis was not so sure.
p236/p236_088|How do you take them away?
p236/p236_426|Everything in golf is a balance.
p236/p236_090|After the match, do you?
p236/p236_342|It was almost too much.
p236/p236_175|What are they for?
p236/p236_246|And they were being paid?
p236/p236_198|The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
p236/p236_490|I had it before the final.
p236/p236_407|He seems to be used to the attention.
p236/p236_058|You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
p236/p236_173|They could not match it.
p236/p236_043|Their campaign is in disarray.
p236/p236_365|There is no deal as yet.
p236/p236_381|I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
p236/p236_502|I stayed away from the defence.
p236/p236_155|Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
p236/p236_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p236/p236_242|You have to do your research.
p236/p236_424|Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
p236/p236_056|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p236/p236_050|I haven't been ill at all.
p236/p236_344|The idea was first mooted a year ago.
p236/p236_368|It was like a weekly wage.
p236/p236_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p236/p236_313|It was an excellent performance.
p236/p236_115|I can't even get into the A team.
p236/p236_316|These figures are truly awful.
p236/p236_470|Neither woman has been named.
p236/p236_283|She always wanted her own way.
p236/p236_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p236/p236_105|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p236/p236_405|But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
p236/p236_275|That could be in place by next year.
p236/p236_437|He said current trading was strong.
p236/p236_136|But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
p236/p236_279|He took over our lives.
p236/p236_026|In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
p236/p236_108|Football is a passion for many.
p236/p236_401|I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
p236/p236_284|I realised I was lucky to have it.
p236/p236_410|He may have a point.
p236/p236_244|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p236/p236_331|Public opinion was split on the proposal.
p236/p236_309|I am a retailer by nature.
p236/p236_280|It has all been done in secret.
p236/p236_087|Does it matter?
p236/p236_093|It is open season on the Old Firm.
p236/p236_110|There's still plenty time left.
p236/p236_301|I think, therefore I am?
p236/p236_128|You are a gambling man.
p236/p236_032|He should emerge as the winner.
p236/p236_409|I would love to think that she could win.
p236/p236_205|It caused a lot of upset.
p236/p236_118|Three hours later, the man was free.
p236/p236_181|At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
p236/p236_048|Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
p236/p236_321|All winners should be tested.
p236/p236_493|I would put my money on Peter Donald.
p236/p236_366|It's as wide as a church in here.
p236/p236_328|After some discussion they did.
p236/p236_209|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p236/p236_363|We must put a marker down.
p236/p236_117|But his attendance is not guaranteed.
p236/p236_475|I could feel the blood on my face.
p236/p236_079|On Saturday, it was much the same.
p236/p236_161|It is not a financial issue.
p236/p236_393|The Cabinet is split over the issue.
p236/p236_189|Tomorrow is a new day.
p236/p236_210|No details of the talks were given.
p236/p236_176|Is there a waiting list?
p236/p236_063|I was as strong as a horse.
p236/p236_099|Before the game we went for a pint.
p236/p236_076|Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
p236/p236_184|The Hibs manager is no fool.
p236/p236_304|He will address the nation this evening.
p236/p236_439|I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
p236/p236_394|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p236/p236_183|I feel like my game has come a long way.
p236/p236_442|Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
p236/p236_388|It brought in new management.
p236/p236_167|Greenwood said he was happy with that.
p236/p236_330|I didn't have the reply.
p236/p236_064|Then followed a bout of flu.
p236/p236_258|He was good, but not that good.
p236/p236_418|I think it's a miracle.
p236/p236_142|It has become a way of life.
p236/p236_227|That might help a bit.
p236/p236_134|I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
p236/p236_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p236/p236_226|There was a lot of resentment.
p236/p236_180|What do they want us to do?
p236/p236_138|It was a piece of art.
p236/p236_253|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p236/p236_255|On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
p236/p236_370|They will fight for everything.
p236/p236_274|He will go on the bench.
p236/p236_207|My duty is to win.
p236/p236_192|I have spoken to head office.
p236/p236_206|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p236/p236_092|The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
p236/p236_035|It is not for any other purpose.
p236/p236_320|Cast Away now on general release.
p236/p236_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p236/p236_314|The answer is with ourselves.
p236/p236_488|It worked well in Monaco.
p236/p236_170|That is not the case.
p236/p236_294|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p236/p236_124|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p236/p236_157|I'm afraid to say anything.
p236/p236_270|But they were never expected to last.
p236/p236_127|They made such decisions in London.
p236/p236_492|The BBC was a disgrace.
p236/p236_357|George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
p236/p236_474|He was a shooting star.
p236/p236_216|The sanctions are about collective punishment.
p236/p236_177|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p236/p236_389|My view has now completely changed.
p236/p236_315|And we can do it.
p236/p236_359|Scotland is the home of golf.
p236/p236_235|Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
p236/p236_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p236/p236_272|The capital costs are modest.
p236/p236_220|You are a great player.
p236/p236_197|That is a waste of energy.
p236/p236_300|What are you not good at?
p236/p236_231|The course has helped a lot.
p236/p236_174|Are they free?
p236/p236_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p236/p236_343|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p236/p236_107|They will notice a difference.
p236/p236_069|It is a job creation scheme.
p236/p236_374|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p236/p236_247|Was everything done to save people?
p236/p236_290|It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
p236/p236_453|The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
p236/p236_288|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p236/p236_219|You have caught a serial killer.
p236/p236_240|People should make their own decisions.
p236/p236_251|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p236/p236_029|It's going to have a hell of an effect.
p236/p236_057|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p236/p236_141|So I got a blood test.
p236/p236_486|However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
p236/p236_382|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p236/p236_273|I told you I was ill.
p236/p236_485|It happens on an annual basis.
p236/p236_422|The fate of the rest is unknown.
p236/p236_140|It's all change at Kilmarnock.
p236/p236_297|What do we want to do that for?
p236/p236_495|The Prime Minister has been in touch.
p236/p236_154|This action reflects a slump in bookings.
p236/p236_298|Does the name matter?
p236/p236_406|It had been on the cards.
p236/p236_380|People are on the alert.
p236/p236_435|But we have built a platform for next season.
p236/p236_199|It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
p236/p236_436|It looked like a war zone.
p236/p236_179|Had this been common practice?
p236/p236_145|We will provide immediate access.
p236/p236_163|Seven people were later detained by police.
p236/p236_146|He could do nothing about it.
p236/p236_317|That is the real test.
p236/p236_431|It was that bad, that low.
p236/p236_386|Clark is back on top form.
p236/p236_464|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p236/p236_340|Even the one she loved.
p236/p236_336|That decision has already been made.
p236/p236_202|However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
p236/p236_341|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p236/p236_349|We put our bid in last night.
p236/p236_218|A deadline is still essential.
p236/p236_122|Becoming a father was wonderful.
p236/p236_346|It's a policy which has worked for us.
p236/p236_286|Much of the equipment was new.
p236/p236_391|The following day I used the story.
p236/p236_182|One season, they might do well.
p236/p236_261|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p236/p236_338|The game is now open.
p236/p236_461|It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
p236/p236_376|All would be under threat.
p236/p236_221|I won't make an official complaint.
p236/p236_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p236/p236_403|I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
p236/p236_086|It was a big departure.
p236/p236_129|Before it was an ordeal.
p236/p236_499|In fact, we were all over the shop.
p236/p236_083|The Queen Mother is dead.
p236/p236_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p236/p236_323|A lot has been written.
p236/p236_463|Not if you know the person.
p236/p236_467|It can all be done over the phone.
p236/p236_144|Like the others, he was arrested.
p236/p236_066|Both men were on one-year contracts.
p236/p236_089|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p236/p236_228|From there, they can go anywhere.
p236/p236_051|They just thought it was extremely good acting.
p236/p236_096|He refused to name the survivors.
p236/p236_428|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p236/p236_466|The boys are mentally focused.
p236/p236_310|His job was not advertised.
p236/p236_252|It's important to get it right.
p236/p236_379|The seller was not revealed.
p236/p236_164|The striker needed attention before he could resume.
p236/p236_054|The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
p236/p236_385|This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
p236/p236_375|Everyone could see the joke.
p236/p236_135|I enjoy the creative process.
p236/p236_120|The colours are very pretty.
p341/p341_124|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p341/p341_183|She is a very lucky lady.
p341/p341_409|He needs to be.
p341/p341_102|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p341/p341_144|He is a very nice man.
p341/p341_221|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p341/p341_292|The whole team was rubbish.
p341/p341_227|Glasgow is going to be open for business.
p341/p341_370|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p341/p341_157|Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
p341/p341_170|We must not give in to bastards.
p341/p341_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p341/p341_213|He was a soldier.
p341/p341_136|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p341/p341_063|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p341/p341_238|We believe we have a strong case.
p341/p341_108|I was a bit nervous.
p341/p341_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p341/p341_399|Things are going very well.
p341/p341_164|It was then into overtime.
p341/p341_035|I am proud of moments like that.
p341/p341_094|We are losing this war.
p341/p341_269|It's one up to the Scots.
p341/p341_298|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p341/p341_113|This is thought to mean sometime next week.
p341/p341_402|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p341/p341_309|They were the better side on the day.
p341/p341_146|Their condition was described as stable.
p341/p341_314|No-one thought about this.
p341/p341_053|It's to do with play.
p341/p341_128|It is crucial for both teams.
p341/p341_046|Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
p341/p341_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p341/p341_026|That's interesting to me.
p341/p341_300|It's a source of deep concern.
p341/p341_038|There is no escape.
p341/p341_317|You will never forget the clutching horror.
p341/p341_195|Felt good about it.
p341/p341_396|But it is all by design.
p341/p341_374|See it while you can.
p341/p341_168|Look at his last couple of records.
p341/p341_247|I live on the streets of Glasgow.
p341/p341_347|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p341/p341_169|I am still very much a director.
p341/p341_234|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p341/p341_307|The Dow Jones is way up.
p341/p341_369|It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
p341/p341_313|Calderwood would agree with that.
p341/p341_245|What makes a house a home?
p341/p341_033|Everything was up for grabs.
p341/p341_222|It is all one-sided.
p341/p341_143|I love you so very much.
p341/p341_112|I love this tournament.
p341/p341_321|No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
p341/p341_282|I have been totally taken aback by this.
p341/p341_132|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p341/p341_043|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p341/p341_333|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p341/p341_116|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p341/p341_277|That is a mark of what you are.
p341/p341_117|Both managements are very supportive.
p341/p341_393|Story time is over - it's a war.
p341/p341_306|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p341/p341_404|Golf has lost a great character.
p341/p341_055|I've just got to do this.
p341/p341_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p341/p341_192|Who is he?
p341/p341_271|And we still have to pay his salary.
p341/p341_410|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p341/p341_140|They really did a great job.
p341/p341_180|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p341/p341_383|Chris Paterson is a class act.
p341/p341_194|No such remedy has ever been pursued.
p341/p341_039|It's wonderful to have won.
p341/p341_376|And we all understand that.
p341/p341_104|We are trying to establish a date.
p341/p341_145|The road was closed for several hours.
p341/p341_218|He doesn't like the Labour Party.
p341/p341_270|I'm just doing artwork.
p341/p341_287|Make sure you see it.
p341/p341_188|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p341/p341_315|We're all in a state of shock.
p341/p341_352|They are just bewildered and very concerned.
p341/p341_067|And who would argue with that?
p341/p341_252|Have we not had the rainy season already?
p341/p341_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p341/p341_325|That did not go down well.
p341/p341_181|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p341/p341_263|This time, there were no such rewards.
p341/p341_265|I gave him a way out, and he took it.
p341/p341_395|However, this idea is never developed.
p341/p341_054|However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
p341/p341_377|One policeman was killed.
p341/p341_378|And it's not funny.
p341/p341_316|I thought he was part of the camera.
p341/p341_349|I've already got them in.
p341/p341_253|I have heard the stories from Scotland.
p341/p341_291|It was just one of those things.
p341/p341_295|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p341/p341_354|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p341/p341_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p341/p341_036|That was no surprise to me.
p341/p341_072|It is time to give her a rest.
p341/p341_065|He had played well in that central role.
p341/p341_283|Are you in this movie?
p341/p341_150|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p341/p341_368|I don't have a new house.
p341/p341_096|The death rates are still as high.
p341/p341_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p341/p341_296|They too refused to come out and talk.
p341/p341_148|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p341/p341_048|All the lads are totally focused on that.
p341/p341_388|Such people do not exist.
p341/p341_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p341/p341_207|She told me to apply for the crest.
p341/p341_341|If there is default.
p341/p341_342|We are very nearly there.
p341/p341_278|His wife Margaret was not in court.
p341/p341_210|He explained to his audience.
p341/p341_361|That's an old idea.
p341/p341_071|Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
p341/p341_362|Scotland is losing business.
p341/p341_118|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p341/p341_329|Soon the whole country will be level.
p341/p341_058|Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
p341/p341_229|I'm not saying he is finished.
p341/p341_051|We are going for it.
p341/p341_228|IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
p341/p341_392|There was someone on the floor.
p341/p341_267|She became very good at it.
p341/p341_184|It's the whole season.
p341/p341_390|Then came the second round.
p341/p341_320|He was released in March this year.
p341/p341_127|I'm so proud of my team.
p341/p341_216|It didn't get any better.
p341/p341_193|It has to be a long-term commitment.
p341/p341_324|Instead, she just went away.
p341/p341_264|He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
p341/p341_141|A teacher is, really, about unity.
p341/p341_232|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p341/p341_034|It's easy to see why.
p341/p341_384|We only lost the third goal.
p341/p341_060|I think it is a sensible change.
p341/p341_073|They had had time for little else.
p341/p341_197|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p341/p341_142|They are still going to be impulsive.
p341/p341_286|The fans will support us.
p341/p341_161|These matters are now behind us.
p341/p341_397|It was a sell-out.
p341/p341_225|Here are some possible solutions.
p341/p341_335|He said he needed no more evidence.
p341/p341_123|The lady is right.
p341/p341_381|They have learned from that.
p341/p341_359|There is too much at stake for that.
p341/p341_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p341/p341_025|This guy is never going to give up.
p341/p341_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p341/p341_171|She may even appear in some more films.
p341/p341_310|What are you going to do exactly?
p341/p341_357|This is normal for him now.
p341/p341_389|Is this new report the answer?
p341/p341_130|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p341/p341_302|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p341/p341_259|Our system is archaic.
p341/p341_103|People buy everything with cash.
p341/p341_258|He loves the big occasions.
p341/p341_365|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p341/p341_190|We are on the path of change.
p341/p341_110|It was love of Helen and the children.
p341/p341_403|She will just have wanted her baby.
p341/p341_155|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p341/p341_276|Their three other children had died as infants.
p341/p341_266|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p341/p341_176|This is a very positive step forward.
p341/p341_356|She had every right to read the warrant.
p341/p341_406|They hold on for many years.
p341/p341_057|So the process was refined.
p341/p341_387|No-one has yet been charged.
p341/p341_290|We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
p341/p341_284|We've got a full house tonight.
p341/p341_251|He admitted the asylum system was not working.
p341/p341_380|We cannot lose it.
p341/p341_076|But there was a shift.
p341/p341_280|I hope my successor will do the same.
p341/p341_322|I stayed away from the defence.
p341/p341_091|It had a gigantic effect.
p341/p341_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p341/p341_106|The website is now being amended.
p341/p341_215|All inquiries should be made to the police.
p341/p341_138|There were no casualties.
p341/p341_246|I think however, he was having a fit!
p341/p341_177|This is a huge confidence boost.
p341/p341_182|Nobody ever knew it had happened.
p341/p341_301|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p341/p341_179|And does it?
p341/p341_231|He is well respected by his colleagues.
p341/p341_032|It has moved on in the last week.
p341/p341_075|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p341/p341_373|He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
p341/p341_312|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p341/p341_262|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p341/p341_211|I think the Government should pay for that.
p341/p341_206|If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
p341/p341_172|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p341/p341_236|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p341/p341_244|It was a big day.
p341/p341_095|It's a difficult one to play.
p341/p341_281|The manager knew me very well.
p341/p341_045|Her daughter is getting married.
p341/p341_186|Promises were not kept.
p341/p341_178|They recorded their debut album in New York.
p341/p341_226|That's the day job.
p341/p341_069|We must put a marker down.
p341/p341_147|There's a good chance of seeing something.
p341/p341_297|But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
p341/p341_120|The choice is strictly personal.
p341/p341_111|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p341/p341_133|There was no hint of bravado.
p341/p341_328|It is a question of balance.
p341/p341_139|The case will now go to appeal.
p341/p341_040|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p341/p341_224|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p341/p341_382|We have been working together for some years.
p341/p341_285|If they don't, they won't get what they want.
p341/p341_064|This is the crossroads.
p341/p341_319|This is very bad news.
p341/p341_199|What's the big idea?
p341/p341_339|They told us about it the next day.
p341/p341_090|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p341/p341_159|That is in the very nature of farming.
p341/p341_255|Do not listen to them.
p341/p341_256|Mind you, who wouldn't?
p341/p341_185|We've been there for seven years.
p341/p341_294|You've got it coming Kabul.
p341/p341_088|I still feel like a wee boy.
p341/p341_061|Sex is fun?
p341/p341_167|It really is a gift to the world.
p341/p341_047|If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
p341/p341_165|Most of the public are behind me.
p341/p341_115|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p341/p341_408|Women reported more depression than men.
p341/p341_097|We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
p341/p341_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p341/p341_196|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p341/p341_119|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p341/p341_371|You are a liar.
p341/p341_340|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p341/p341_089|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p341/p341_029|The injuries are not too serious.
p341/p341_100|I don't think it could be clearer.
p341/p341_175|Of course he is.
p341/p341_050|That says something for his strength of character.
p341/p341_041|He was arrested, but later released without charge.
p341/p341_327|It was chaotic and frightening.
p341/p341_223|I've been thinking about it for a year.
p341/p341_068|Where is the human rights?
p341/p341_052|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p341/p341_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p341/p341_250|I'll go back home and see my family.
p341/p341_391|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p341/p341_066|He is pretty upset.
p341/p341_086|You can't keep them separate.
p341/p341_082|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p341/p341_200|One season, they might do well.
p341/p341_081|Robert is a special talent.
p341/p341_105|He is a law unto himself.
p341/p341_311|We have lost the round, but not the fight.
p341/p341_367|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p341/p341_092|Israel has done very little until now.
p341/p341_299|That was enough for the committee.
p341/p341_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p341/p341_348|The urgency is real.
p341/p341_189|I've already done that.
p341/p341_001|Please call Stella.
p341/p341_237|Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
p341/p341_152|Such a city does not exist.
p341/p341_107|There was great support all round the route.
p341/p341_122|He had other things on his mind.
p341/p341_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p341/p341_154|He came in an army uniform.
p341/p341_042|I fell into it by accident.
p341/p341_217|I'm a bit annoyed.
p341/p341_056|It's not, of course, a concert hall.
p341/p341_209|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p341/p341_305|However, there are also many areas of agreement.
p341/p341_239|I lost it at the final whistle.
p341/p341_214|The budget was too low for that.
p341/p341_274|So there's a double whammy.
p341/p341_098|It is a great honour and a privilege.
p341/p341_077|The settlement could run to millions.
p341/p341_134|However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
p341/p341_375|Folk music is in her blood.
p341/p341_079|We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
p341/p341_083|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p341/p341_037|This has been blown out of all proportion.
p341/p341_031|I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
p341/p341_070|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p341/p341_330|And huge, indeed, it is.
p341/p341_308|We have to adapt to this level.
p341/p341_273|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p341/p341_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p341/p341_398|We've still got a say in this.
p341/p341_240|Bill is a mentor.
p341/p341_241|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p341/p341_364|What's happening to her?
p341/p341_027|I managed to take her completely by surprise.
p341/p341_318|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p341/p341_233|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p341/p341_360|Nobody ever gets to see them.
p341/p341_101|That meant the search was unlawful.
p341/p341_337|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p341/p341_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p341/p341_203|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p341/p341_243|One must hope not!
p341/p341_372|Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
p341/p341_230|That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
p341/p341_135|Yet he chose to do something different.
p341/p341_379|I didn't do too badly myself.
p341/p341_187|His signature is his handwriting.
p341/p341_087|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p341/p341_401|I'll take what comes along.
p341/p341_131|You can see their point.
p341/p341_254|Sub Not Used, McKay.
p341/p341_363|The place became a war zone.
p341/p341_125|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p341/p341_208|Too much has already been said.
p341/p341_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
p341/p341_198|Why does she suddenly win everything now?
p341/p341_279|Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
p341/p341_174|They will know they deserve to be there.
p341/p341_336|People might not actually want the job.
p341/p341_173|My house was shaking at the time.
p341/p341_062|They were not doing it too well, either.
p341/p341_257|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p341/p341_405|You have to have some hope and faith.
p341/p341_338|It broke up my marriage.
p341/p341_205|I feel privileged to be here.
p341/p341_158|But my heart is in athletics.
p341/p341_358|Nothing was going to go right.
p341/p341_153|My aim is a top six finish.
p341/p341_293|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p341/p341_353|I can't stop people thinking.
p341/p341_093|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p341/p341_351|The science is well known, the solution is simple.
p341/p341_400|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p341/p341_085|She added, It is a huge problem.
p341/p341_332|I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
p341/p341_166|The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
p341/p341_323|We do need to get the message across.
p341/p341_163|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p341/p341_212|I asked why he had come.
p341/p341_149|I had a tie in my hand.
p341/p341_326|The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
p341/p341_346|Barry will be able to handle this.
p341/p341_355|I have not been so angry for years.
p341/p341_059|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p341/p341_386|That gave us some confidence.
p341/p341_080|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
p341/p341_201|It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
p341/p341_407|However, the report was incorrect.
p341/p341_129|It ended as it began, in confusion.
p341/p341_137|At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
p341/p341_074|The feeling is awesome.
p341/p341_099|We certainly will need to watch him.
p341/p341_344|We have to go for it.
p341/p341_366|Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
p341/p341_151|Sean Connery did not disappoint.
p341/p341_288|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p341/p341_028|It is only one night, after all.
p341/p341_084|They are going to carry it through.
p341/p341_272|Also, he was flawed.
p341/p341_249|It doesn't make sense.
p341/p341_345|I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
p341/p341_394|Maybe, who knows?
p341/p341_289|We are aware of the two incidents.
p341/p341_248|I will not be pressured.
p341/p341_242|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p341/p341_030|Gilbert was not amused.
p341/p341_126|The next few months will tell.
p341/p341_204|It's up to their parents to choose.
p341/p341_156|It was to no avail.
p341/p341_160|You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
p341/p341_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p341/p341_109|It was a bit of a struggle today.
p341/p341_350|He takes time out for everyone.
p341/p341_202|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p341/p341_049|Today is not about contracts.
p341/p341_114|He had a heart problem.
p341/p341_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p341/p341_220|I just could not cope.
p341/p341_219|I am totally devoted to this job.
p341/p341_261|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p341/p341_304|It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
p341/p341_331|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p341/p341_334|For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
p341/p341_385|And that's the question for the Chamber.
p341/p341_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p341/p341_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p341/p341_044|This is a big advantage.
p341/p341_121|We are going to go about our lives.
p341/p341_191|You can feel at home in China.
p341/p341_303|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p341/p341_260|It was a tactical change.
p341/p341_275|I didn't have a trio.
p341/p341_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p341/p341_343|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p341/p341_162|I'm working on that.
p341/p341_268|We don't have the credible evidence.
p341/p341_078|It does not stop at the border.
p238/p238_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p238/p238_390|It's difficult to put a date on.
p238/p238_260|It's about time something was done about equipment.
p238/p238_322|And we have the experience.
p238/p238_326|Confidence among the allies began to slip.
p238/p238_042|We want to get back into the Champions League.
p238/p238_113|Those people must be accountable.
p238/p238_219|Bottling is now the core business.
p238/p238_342|He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
p238/p238_415|Motherwell have no such good fortune.
p238/p238_147|Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
p238/p238_252|was everything done to save people?
p238/p238_274|He is a right bastard.
p238/p238_362|It was a good workout.
p238/p238_225|That group reported just before Christmas.
p238/p238_035|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p238/p238_361|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p238/p238_140|This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
p238/p238_172|We continue to hold the shares.
p238/p238_350|What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
p238/p238_174|Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
p238/p238_176|Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
p238/p238_052|He is too weak to move.
p238/p238_164|Yet the survey has been cautious.
p238/p238_288|Says the Duke of York.
p238/p238_171|I've no idea how it works.
p238/p238_068|In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
p238/p238_126|What do they want us to do?
p238/p238_244|Mr Blair had done well.
p238/p238_375|And he goes with it.
p238/p238_410|But nothing could be done.
p238/p238_154|They make a selective perception process.
p238/p238_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p238/p238_381|It was cynical and callous.
p238/p238_235|For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
p238/p238_148|The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
p238/p238_386|Why do it otherwise?
p238/p238_273|Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
p238/p238_134|The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
p238/p238_349|My father died in childbirth.
p238/p238_254|Do I think about them often?
p238/p238_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p238/p238_284|This championship is different from the other majors.
p238/p238_392|Those overseas offices were great.
p238/p238_108|We have thought about doing lots of things.
p238/p238_304|Who was she?
p238/p238_144|All the employees are redundant.
p238/p238_431|We go there with confidence.
p238/p238_098|Maybe this battle has been.
p238/p238_061|We work for the athlete.
p238/p238_297|I'm interested in interesting work.
p238/p238_091|The result is utterly compelling.
p238/p238_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p238/p238_041|She became a heroine of my childhood.
p238/p238_275|Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
p238/p238_211|But experts have disputed that statistic.
p238/p238_307|Friday night was a pretty good night.
p238/p238_215|In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
p238/p238_109|England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
p238/p238_428|Messages have to be reinforced.
p238/p238_409|How are you, sir?
p238/p238_039|And so was a photograph.
p238/p238_277|He is not a pathetic figure.
p238/p238_440|Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
p238/p238_038|Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
p238/p238_075|The wingers must have felt the cold.
p238/p238_413|We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
p238/p238_223|We were right to be afraid.
p238/p238_328|Margins are also in retreat.
p238/p238_220|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
p238/p238_197|His words were not audible.
p238/p238_025|Smoking is also very important.
p238/p238_460|It is business as usual.
p238/p238_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p238/p238_393|You will have seen the adverts.
p238/p238_427|It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
p238/p238_268|The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
p238/p238_221|The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
p238/p238_253|What was the matter for concern?
p238/p238_182|The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
p238/p238_356|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p238/p238_373|But you never won any games.
p238/p238_321|We believe a third party was involved.
p238/p238_222|People have been wonderful beyond belief.
p238/p238_138|Monty is great in his own backyard.
p238/p238_276|They could not match it.
p238/p238_388|His successor was only appointed last month.
p238/p238_394|He was dead on arrival at hospital.
p238/p238_422|The company declined to comment.
p238/p238_089|This is equally relevant to the landowner.
p238/p238_317|Here the picture is broadly stable.
p238/p238_188|He is survived by his wife and two sons.
p238/p238_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p238/p238_143|But it looks good for next year.
p238/p238_267|The strong performance is expected to continue.
p238/p238_093|He seems to have everything.
p238/p238_112|Harrowing is easy, after all.
p238/p238_200|Does that put pressure on us?
p238/p238_346|His third goal was superb.
p238/p238_145|His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
p238/p238_313|Movie stars are public property.
p238/p238_085|It is somewhere to be.
p238/p238_374|It didn't matter who was in their way.
p238/p238_396|Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
p238/p238_452|We didn't want any trouble.
p238/p238_248|It would seem a natural progression.
p238/p238_084|He's very young and very keen to do well.
p238/p238_186|Scottish football is finally on its way back.
p238/p238_129|They lived for their children.
p238/p238_391|The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
p238/p238_389|I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
p238/p238_116|Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
p238/p238_169|I can see it now.
p238/p238_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p238/p238_371|We will likely look for new investors.
p238/p238_372|But the rally was short-lived.
p238/p238_305|Motorists will buy passes in advance.
p238/p238_250|My Dad is a hero.
p238/p238_099|Then followed a bout of flu.
p238/p238_190|You just have to accept.
p238/p238_364|William Hague delighted his party.
p238/p238_056|After the match, do you?
p238/p238_425|We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
p238/p238_127|Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
p238/p238_104|That would be the case with Dundee.
p238/p238_173|The festivals will be about having fun.
p238/p238_325|Their conclusions were never published.
p238/p238_177|The changes took effect from June.
p238/p238_280|You've got to be vigilant.
p238/p238_333|Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
p238/p238_087|We will pay their bills.
p238/p238_272|Her political persuasion is no secret.
p238/p238_330|It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
p238/p238_026|The first appeared to be successful.
p238/p238_146|Four meetings have previously been arranged.
p238/p238_358|He remains a main board director of Royal.
p238/p238_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p238/p238_119|What form did that take?
p238/p238_231|So I got a blood test.
p238/p238_368|We can have no complaints.
p238/p238_337|Abbey National is an option.
p238/p238_331|The move follows a review of the Singapore
p238/p238_285|But I was glad to see these interviews.
p238/p238_150|It is a vicious circle.
p238/p238_443|Still, some additions are inspired.
p238/p238_403|That remains the unanswered question.
p238/p238_125|Had this been common practice?
p238/p238_357|And the World Cup has not even begun.
p238/p238_122|Is there a waiting list?
p238/p238_271|I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
p238/p238_149|And they all have a vote.
p238/p238_241|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p238/p238_118|It's going to be epic.
p238/p238_405|Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
p238/p238_256|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p238/p238_168|They almost achieved a draw.
p238/p238_133|We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
p238/p238_312|Pulled a huge number of viewers.
p238/p238_058|Have I really come to this?
p238/p238_226|I am considered a teenager.
p238/p238_448|Our performance continues to be outstanding.
p238/p238_139|Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
p238/p238_160|His job was not advertised.
p238/p238_246|Then we will face the Danish champions.
p238/p238_079|But the organisers refused to worry.
p238/p238_032|The staff are very good.
p238/p238_454|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p238/p238_191|There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
p238/p238_232|No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
p238/p238_040|I remember that day well.
p238/p238_243|It is crucial for both teams.
p238/p238_269|It was a bit of a tightrope.
p238/p238_309|You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
p238/p238_130|Potions said he would drive.
p238/p238_311|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p238/p238_384|Do I have a favourite?
p238/p238_352|So what is the campaign about?
p238/p238_245|I was a lucky man tonight.
p238/p238_136|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p238/p238_217|I will not take part in Edmonton.
p238/p238_077|I have made that offer.
p238/p238_095|It wasn't possible to relax.
p238/p238_447|I stayed away from the defence.
p238/p238_338|We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
p238/p238_097|I was very pleased with them today, though.
p238/p238_092|Final proposals will be published in February.
p238/p238_037|The ambition this year is to improve on last.
p238/p238_067|Then they scored two goals to win.
p238/p238_294|We've had great things in the past.
p238/p238_070|The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
p238/p238_224|The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
p238/p238_412|Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
p238/p238_286|Each case is treated on merit.
p238/p238_249|Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
p238/p238_131|This is a sizeable part of our business.
p238/p238_319|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
p238/p238_334|They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
p238/p238_141|Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
p238/p238_251|And they were being paid?
p238/p238_207|There was a fine line to tread.
p238/p238_359|People should make their own decisions.
p238/p238_339|Harry Potter has lost his magic.
p238/p238_237|Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
p238/p238_340|Today we must not repeat that mistake.
p238/p238_170|This is a step backwards.
p238/p238_028|There was a rush of water.
p238/p238_343|Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
p238/p238_206|Truth is the child of time.
p238/p238_181|We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
p238/p238_203|Is our children learning?
p238/p238_407|And it had two seats.
p238/p238_336|Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
p238/p238_436|The only problem was, they were on himself.
p238/p238_290|We've just had it confirmed.
p238/p238_157|The following are the principal provisions.
p238/p238_353|This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
p238/p238_318|Sadly, it does not end there.
p238/p238_310|We are trying to clarify the issues.
p238/p238_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p238/p238_120|Are they free?
p238/p238_051|And they removed a Borderer.
p238/p238_036|Let there be no doubt about that.
p238/p238_402|Venus rejects the very suggestion.
p238/p238_069|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p238/p238_214|Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
p238/p238_233|Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
p238/p238_086|We should all be grateful.
p238/p238_185|But we could only help a handful of people.
p238/p238_196|Tiger is not the norm.
p238/p238_158|But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
p238/p238_332|Which isn't a bad idea.
p238/p238_096|He was at home with his pals.
p238/p238_411|This is a historic occasion.
p238/p238_187|This is a frightening development.
p238/p238_298|They will probably come back.
p238/p238_166|YOU cannot blame the turnout.
p238/p238_296|But there's an upturn in the sector.
p238/p238_179|You can spend money on housing.
p238/p238_057|Has the conflict started?
p238/p238_103|The fans would love it.
p238/p238_046|Separate approvals would be needed for these.
p238/p238_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p238/p238_282|The happiness was slightly misplaced.
p238/p238_106|Talk of a crisis is absurd.
p238/p238_401|He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
p238/p238_270|It's never great to finish second.
p238/p238_065|We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
p238/p238_230|Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
p238/p238_302|What are you not good at?
p238/p238_088|It was exactly four months away.
p238/p238_201|Did it work?
p238/p238_159|Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
p238/p238_347|I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
p238/p238_060|Well, he is an artist.
p238/p238_418|We have no information on Iraq.
p238/p238_369|The statement contained no surprises.
p238/p238_142|The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
p238/p238_345|My daughter is an adult.
p238/p238_053|Does it matter?
p238/p238_063|Everything else is a bonus.
p238/p238_281|First, the programme was unbalanced.
p238/p238_059|They desperately want some stability.
p238/p238_050|The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
p238/p238_446|Hard cash is needed now.
p238/p238_198|You are a gambling man.
p238/p238_240|There's only one team in Ayrshire.
p238/p238_083|The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
p238/p238_417|This would discourage investment and job creation.
p238/p238_202|Do you think we are a top nation?
p238/p238_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p238/p238_257|It was a terrible combination of factors.
p238/p238_429|Not many people like to do that.
p238/p238_107|Their mandate is to target inflation.
p238/p238_293|She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
p238/p238_044|It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
p238/p238_423|It also makes a habit of collecting people.
p238/p238_445|The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
p238/p238_236|That proved enough to settle the home side down.
p238/p238_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p238/p238_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p238/p238_054|How do you take them away?
p238/p238_323|The early physical reports were clear.
p238/p238_115|It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
p238/p238_259|Arsenal refused to be evicted.
p238/p238_033|Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
p238/p238_365|His background is firmly in venture capital.
p238/p238_430|We accept the new rules.
p238/p238_255|Is it in the right place?
p238/p238_161|He was just like a godfather to it.
p238/p238_238|Five years later, the deception continued.
p238/p238_178|Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
p238/p238_291|Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
p238/p238_306|No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
p238/p238_247|But it couldn't happen overnight.
p238/p238_043|The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
p238/p238_456|Now it has doubled in size.
p238/p238_354|They're going to open in early summer.
p238/p238_341|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p238/p238_424|Got to get my sunglasses.
p238/p238_031|Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
p238/p238_137|I won't make an official complaint.
p238/p238_076|I am relishing the challenge.
p238/p238_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p238/p238_048|Among them are many criminals.
p238/p238_387|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p238/p238_029|Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
p238/p238_399|Colin is free to speak with other teams.
p238/p238_380|It is the voice of the survivors.
p238/p238_414|Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
p238/p238_324|Celtic were the losers then.
p238/p238_184|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p238/p238_175|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p238/p238_385|What do we do?
p238/p238_239|Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
p238/p238_444|I believe we can handle this okay.
p238/p238_449|Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
p238/p238_376|I have little time for analysts.
p238/p238_308|This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
p238/p238_071|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
p238/p238_218|We will try to find someone.
p238/p238_080|We have to keep our clients.
p238/p238_123|Do they think anyone else wants them?
p238/p238_135|No one person or small group could be singled out.
p238/p238_208|The refund is fully justified.
p238/p238_327|Little is known about them.
p238/p238_416|However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
p238/p238_301|how do you get it back?
p238/p238_192|The Yugoslav army will still be there.
p238/p238_432|It was like the old days.
p238/p238_204|How independent is that?
p238/p238_355|Anyway, the job will be part-time.
p238/p238_458|I have worked as a stand-up there often.
p238/p238_320|Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
p238/p238_287|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
p238/p238_398|Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
p238/p238_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p238/p238_047|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p238/p238_395|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p238/p238_335|He was admitted to hospital.
p238/p238_027|We must convince the citizens.
p238/p238_377|The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
p238/p238_451|It has become a way of life.
p238/p238_101|It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
p238/p238_111|After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
p238/p238_434|They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
p238/p238_439|It is also very valuable.
p238/p238_295|It has been recorded twice.
p238/p238_072|I had relied on him.
p238/p238_419|Either way, the investor retains the premium.
p238/p238_074|We felt it was sufficient.
p238/p238_155|That's what happened against Ayr.
p238/p238_258|This is absolutely not true.
p238/p238_132|Diversions were put in place.
p238/p238_090|He thought she was amazing.
p238/p238_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p238/p238_279|I came up through the ranks.
p238/p238_262|Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
p238/p238_360|I saw them last week.
p238/p238_366|We played them off the pitch.
p238/p238_408|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
p238/p238_299|What do we want to do that for?
p238/p238_234|There's always the next century.
p238/p238_316|That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
p238/p238_121|What are they for?
p238/p238_228|Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
p238/p238_397|Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
p238/p238_351|So, did she meet him?
p238/p238_266|The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
p238/p238_370|Not that Barber has been unhappy.
p238/p238_441|None of this work is guaranteed.
p238/p238_378|It was really quite amazing.
p238/p238_278|The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
p238/p238_404|Everything has its place and purpose.
p238/p238_212|It is time for confession.
p238/p238_289|He is a serial Conservative assassin.
p238/p238_199|Did he trip?
p238/p238_114|If they liked it then I'll be happy.
p238/p238_195|This Patton will also return.
p238/p238_315|Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
p238/p238_064|He will need that machine.
p238/p238_165|The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
p238/p238_062|He looks like an Afghan.
p238/p238_193|The squad is too small.
p238/p238_156|Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
p238/p238_128|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p238/p238_437|We are aiming for early March.
p238/p238_344|This is a sensible and common sense approach.
p238/p238_227|Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
p238/p238_117|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
p238/p238_102|It's very dangerous for markets.
p238/p238_314|Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
p238/p238_264|It is a terrible tragedy.
p238/p238_094|There can be no compromise on welfare.
p238/p238_329|Golf is not like that.
p238/p238_420|They prefer the short, intensive session.
p238/p238_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p238/p238_124|So what happens next?
p238/p238_406|He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
p238/p238_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p238/p238_453|It seemed a logical expansion.
p238/p238_030|Further management changes are planned.
p238/p238_426|Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
p238/p238_167|We can't get over it.
p238/p238_242|It is not normal practice.
p238/p238_213|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
p238/p238_110|This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
p238/p238_438|We discovered that for ourselves.
p238/p238_383|So is that it, then?
p238/p238_189|This should begin in October.
p238/p238_001|Please call Stella.
p238/p238_450|Either way, it's very funny.
p238/p238_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p238/p238_055|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
p238/p238_379|It represents a complete change in emphasis.
p238/p238_180|Since then, things have improved.
p238/p238_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p238/p238_455|Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
p238/p238_216|It was started almost by accident.
p238/p238_100|Both sides have been hit by injury.
p238/p238_229|That view has not altered.
p238/p238_183|Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
p238/p238_459|They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
p238/p238_261|They should stop the bombing.
p238/p238_442|Now we see no mention of rising rates.
p238/p238_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p238/p238_152|Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
p238/p238_303|I think, therefore I am?
p238/p238_081|We should be able to cope.
p238/p238_073|And then there's the racial hassle.
p238/p238_194|He has had success at every level.
p238/p238_400|Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
p238/p238_292|Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
p238/p238_163|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p238/p238_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p238/p238_049|It comes from reflection or thinking.
p238/p238_066|It's the performance we want.
p238/p238_209|Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
p238/p238_265|The agreement remains the only show in town.
p238/p238_045|This represents a tough game for us.
p238/p238_283|Phase one was a shambles.
p238/p238_300|Does the name matter?
p238/p238_162|The milk industry is in turmoil.
p238/p238_382|He did not say that.
p238/p238_421|Washington is consumed by the crisis.
p238/p238_433|They are interior designers and architects.
p238/p238_435|I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
p238/p238_105|Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
p238/p238_082|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
p238/p238_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p238/p238_151|Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
p238/p238_263|Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
p238/p238_363|A small number of new jobs will also be created.
p238/p238_034|Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
p238/p238_078|No plans for projects are yet in place.
p360/p360_200|The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
p360/p360_327|That was the gimmick.
p360/p360_241|It is all very upbeat.
p360/p360_319|It won't be their last.
p360/p360_357|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
p360/p360_351|The most important thing was to win today.
p360/p360_353|This is a moment to seize.
p360/p360_373|Or is it?
p360/p360_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p360/p360_035|He would not have to explain.
p360/p360_031|There are two problems.
p360/p360_029|You are not allowed to do that.
p360/p360_076|That perhaps is behind the problem.
p360/p360_307|They are not falling now.
p360/p360_129|We have a long way to go.
p360/p360_305|I'm really proud of her.
p360/p360_386|They are with their father.
p360/p360_283|We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
p360/p360_161|I told them they shouldn't say that.
p360/p360_208|That remains the unanswered question.
p360/p360_242|I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
p360/p360_356|They said that they stood by their statement.
p360/p360_294|We are in it for the long-term.
p360/p360_027|Is that it?
p360/p360_073|The bombing begins in five minutes.
p360/p360_194|But it won't make a difference.
p360/p360_368|Having done it, he was asked again.
p360/p360_405|It was all too little, too late.
p360/p360_335|That is a tragedy.
p360/p360_171|And the results were impressive.
p360/p360_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p360/p360_263|It can take a long time.
p360/p360_292|I am in a good position.
p360/p360_276|They might well be right.
p360/p360_252|But it was too late.
p360/p360_329|He has changed my life forever.
p360/p360_285|These things happen in football but shouldn't.
p360/p360_141|That was the theory.
p360/p360_333|Pakistan denied the report.
p360/p360_245|We deserved the draw.
p360/p360_042|I have no intention of resigning today.
p360/p360_224|It just never comes together.
p360/p360_062|No person was charged.
p360/p360_250|It is part of his game.
p360/p360_101|It is not in the public interest.
p360/p360_061|I can't believe she is dead.
p360/p360_384|IS Tony Blair on drugs?
p360/p360_163|Little is known about them.
p360/p360_278|The warning is timely.
p360/p360_135|I am ready for that.
p360/p360_173|Hopefully it will be a good day.
p360/p360_306|What does this mean?
p360/p360_238|This is a historic occasion.
p360/p360_344|They have brought in the replacement.
p360/p360_053|She said she was really sorry.
p360/p360_157|Conditions were very difficult for the players.
p360/p360_365|She has never been back.
p360/p360_295|But it didn't bother me.
p360/p360_115|It has no place in football.
p360/p360_339|You can't get the experience in Austria.
p360/p360_126|Or was it?
p360/p360_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p360/p360_069|It was that kind of afternoon.
p360/p360_314|And that match was played in June.
p360/p360_197|Here it was very subdued.
p360/p360_051|When he came to see me on Monday.
p360/p360_385|I didn't do it.
p360/p360_251|Did he just want to be on telly?
p360/p360_133|I had a train to catch.
p360/p360_186|I certainly do not agree with that.
p360/p360_341|There will be no backing down.
p360/p360_397|It is a relief.
p360/p360_145|What's it going to be then?
p360/p360_297|And Michael was just great.
p360/p360_178|The police have an awful lot to explain.
p360/p360_154|But other Ministers are not convinced.
p360/p360_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p360/p360_216|But sometimes it was even worse.
p360/p360_112|She was close to suicide at one stage.
p360/p360_180|I could easy do that.
p360/p360_119|I have spoken to head office.
p360/p360_128|But they are a good team.
p360/p360_378|The problems began a long time ago.
p360/p360_317|He is a sort of a mystery figure.
p360/p360_298|He did it well.
p360/p360_094|It's nice to be involved.
p360/p360_099|It was the dreaded sentence.
p360/p360_234|So what's it all about?
p360/p360_037|We are just happy that hasn't happened.
p360/p360_336|I am very happy.
p360/p360_225|The club has never won it.
p360/p360_338|But this is nonsense.
p360/p360_414|And they went on to win the title.
p360/p360_220|I was pleased about that.
p360/p360_346|We are working so hard.
p360/p360_323|He should be worried about me.
p360/p360_209|Everyone is too upset to comment.
p360/p360_303|They were not at the property yesterday.
p360/p360_079|The voters rejected us.
p360/p360_111|People were hitting the floor.
p360/p360_418|There's no place to hide.
p360/p360_408|What was all that about?
p360/p360_282|It was important to bring them all together.
p360/p360_420|Tiger is the exception.
p360/p360_201|I sincerely hope not.
p360/p360_321|He has yet to receive a reply.
p360/p360_144|That was worth it.
p360/p360_219|There will be good prospects ahead.
p360/p360_127|We are under no illusions about this.
p360/p360_272|Players have to accept this.
p360/p360_071|What happens next?
p360/p360_081|Nothing is going right at the moment.
p360/p360_230|The characters are always the first attraction.
p360/p360_304|We will not tolerate it.
p360/p360_363|It is time to fight a decisive battle.
p360/p360_098|The release attracted little attention.
p360/p360_063|But it would say that.
p360/p360_164|It is a new company for Scotland.
p360/p360_383|Their families are gone.
p360/p360_380|What other retailer would do this?
p360/p360_359|He has never let them down.
p360/p360_376|But everywhere the problems are the same.
p360/p360_183|You have to wait.
p360/p360_054|That will be important.
p360/p360_182|I try to be clear in the narrative.
p360/p360_206|No-one has used it since then.
p360/p360_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p360/p360_060|But there is no easy option.
p360/p360_280|The joint bid is still on course.
p360/p360_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p360/p360_106|Consumers will also benefit.
p360/p360_166|A good actor doesn't think.
p360/p360_366|It will set the tone.
p360/p360_391|Sometimes we find a person.
p360/p360_409|What's the problem with change?
p360/p360_268|There was no let-up for the minnows.
p360/p360_235|I think he was lost for words.
p360/p360_266|He was pleased with his display.
p360/p360_049|But we are confident.
p360/p360_120|I'm not thinking about anyone else.
p360/p360_059|The incidents are not believed to be linked.
p360/p360_082|We never publicise it.
p360/p360_301|He will be missed.
p360/p360_411|What she can't have is the money.
p360/p360_122|When she went off it was quite amazing.
p360/p360_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p360/p360_403|It has great potential.
p360/p360_334|It will be up to the government.
p360/p360_179|That's when you hope to take advantage.
p360/p360_218|That's a big reduction.
p360/p360_080|There was a definite prejudice.
p360/p360_310|I've been waiting a long time.
p360/p360_413|This is not the end.
p360/p360_205|We didn't, and it worked for us.
p360/p360_281|A press conference is about politics.
p360/p360_261|The distinction is also supported by doctors.
p360/p360_138|That's the way they are.
p360/p360_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p360/p360_361|That would be very good for Rangers.
p360/p360_320|You've got to have both sides.
p360/p360_275|It disappeared into the cup.
p360/p360_343|That must have had an effect.
p360/p360_221|That has not changed.
p360/p360_058|As for the warning, it was not needed.
p360/p360_406|Still, it is a very good result for us.
p360/p360_375|The whole family was in shock.
p360/p360_041|A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
p360/p360_025|You can never take a win for granted.
p360/p360_354|I would not do that.
p360/p360_075|It's worth it, though.
p360/p360_229|Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
p360/p360_379|It meant a lot to us.
p360/p360_350|I suppose it is quite exciting really.
p360/p360_064|Most of the works are small in scale.
p360/p360_389|No, they are not the same thing.
p360/p360_134|And this game is all about belief.
p360/p360_036|I want to deliver a learning society.
p360/p360_374|What's the difference?
p360/p360_423|It's unfair on her.
p360/p360_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p360/p360_233|This is wonderful news.
p360/p360_193|There are some good people in there.
p360/p360_070|His presence was very important.
p360/p360_269|The bottom line is that this must stop.
p360/p360_211|We should have no more problems.
p360/p360_244|The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
p360/p360_398|The boat was fantastic.
p360/p360_088|They couldn't keep it together.
p360/p360_137|The only safe investment is cash.
p360/p360_253|I didn't see the point.
p360/p360_362|It's something he has worked very hard on.
p360/p360_097|There is much work to do.
p360/p360_214|It was one of those things.
p360/p360_228|It will be a huge difference.
p360/p360_050|It is like a football team.
p360/p360_355|Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
p360/p360_083|You will be very welcome.
p360/p360_348|Our position is extremely simple.
p360/p360_259|It makes me feel difficult.
p360/p360_125|It was all very good stuff.
p360/p360_352|Golf is not like that.
p360/p360_123|Britain has never had it so good.
p360/p360_090|We will continue to provide support for them.
p360/p360_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p360/p360_092|It was looking bad.
p360/p360_322|It has been only average.
p360/p360_239|No-one expected that their parents would stay.
p360/p360_131|Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
p360/p360_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p360/p360_415|Now, she will not be running at all.
p360/p360_212|Pensions are a long-term investment.
p360/p360_084|His musicals were very much of their time.
p360/p360_130|I hope it has helped the prisoners.
p360/p360_198|Stardom is a funny thing.
p360/p360_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p360/p360_243|We're looking for unity in the council.
p360/p360_393|I am in a very difficult position.
p360/p360_039|I'm so grateful for that.
p360/p360_028|You have been warned.
p360/p360_381|Other musicians were found in retirement.
p360/p360_172|The next game is today.
p360/p360_364|That gives it a spirit.
p360/p360_203|She would say he was still the best.
p360/p360_416|It's not an impression.
p360/p360_326|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p360/p360_227|So it was at Easter Road.
p360/p360_093|That's what makes it interesting.
p360/p360_396|And what do we have?
p360/p360_168|It was extremely difficult.
p360/p360_402|There is so much at stake.
p360/p360_030|That depends on Rangers.
p360/p360_147|Our players are exhausted.
p360/p360_057|It was very full anyway.
p360/p360_136|It is a fantasy.
p360/p360_332|I don't think he played his best.
p360/p360_095|It's not a game.
p360/p360_367|They are not going away.
p360/p360_223|We are not conducting the review.
p360/p360_291|We've been here before.
p360/p360_167|But the action is about to be restarted.
p360/p360_422|They need time to think.
p360/p360_177|Was the punishment excessive?
p360/p360_274|Neither had the public.
p360/p360_104|The call was ignored.
p360/p360_222|It's a creative energy.
p360/p360_038|I had to be into it.
p360/p360_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p360/p360_185|It's their moment of choice.
p360/p360_100|I have never considered it.
p360/p360_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p360/p360_258|You will gain from that.
p360/p360_162|I don't know how they do it.
p360/p360_065|He was pronounced dead at the scene.
p360/p360_174|I was a silly bastard.
p360/p360_248|No one was injured.
p360/p360_108|We opened up and everything was gone.
p360/p360_277|I have no further comment to make.
p360/p360_143|Now we look forward to it.
p360/p360_273|He is completely committed to us.
p360/p360_390|In football it is not always the case.
p360/p360_046|And maybe they have.
p360/p360_151|This has been carried out.
p360/p360_340|I'm going to miss it.
p360/p360_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p360/p360_289|Is it on a building site?
p360/p360_237|I want to celebrate the World Cup.
p360/p360_026|My conscience is not clear.
p360/p360_118|He played it like a veteran.
p360/p360_078|The question was simple enough.
p360/p360_240|And what happens?
p360/p360_210|They tried to give her advice.
p360/p360_315|We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
p360/p360_410|I intend to end it on a high.
p360/p360_146|Who was being affected?
p360/p360_360|There was no-one of the required standard.
p360/p360_226|His leader wanted to celebrate.
p360/p360_066|Only the bomber was killed.
p360/p360_279|Those were the days.
p360/p360_424|As for Owen, class is permanent.
p360/p360_271|That was six years ago.
p360/p360_370|The package is a changing one.
p360/p360_045|This will take up to nine months.
p360/p360_165|We're very unhappy about it.
p360/p360_102|They had been forced to walk.
p360/p360_264|I don't intend to do so now.
p360/p360_247|It's up to the defence team.
p360/p360_318|I have learned a lot.
p360/p360_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p360/p360_067|But he just carried on anyway.
p360/p360_150|We've had an enjoyable adventure.
p360/p360_124|So many people will be affected by this.
p360/p360_160|However, we will have to wait and see.
p360/p360_265|There is no answer to it.
p360/p360_072|They couldn't believe what had happened.
p360/p360_345|How did it all come about?
p360/p360_159|I didn't think we deserved to go out.
p360/p360_349|Where did that finish?
p360/p360_412|I thought they played well.
p360/p360_217|We had to work hard for it.
p360/p360_316|I don't mean in a frightening way.
p360/p360_114|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p360/p360_347|One was a lawyer.
p360/p360_372|Frankly, that's not good enough.
p360/p360_284|They tend to be female and retired.
p360/p360_117|This is a classic.
p360/p360_086|This year the exercise is being repeated.
p360/p360_132|I knew that we needed to get out.
p360/p360_196|I think that he got the message.
p360/p360_215|I can understand that.
p360/p360_140|We are trying to be realistic.
p360/p360_313|The response from everyone was wonderful.
p360/p360_052|That's a concern to me.
p360/p360_286|It looks as though he will be right.
p360/p360_195|I'm not going to blame the band.
p360/p360_213|An announcement is expected soon.
p360/p360_077|I have to hand it to the bank.
p360/p360_287|We know the fight is going to happen.
p360/p360_089|We discovered that for ourselves.
p360/p360_260|We couldn't believe it at first.
p360/p360_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p360/p360_176|The process will start tomorrow.
p360/p360_358|That has to be allowed.
p360/p360_110|They offered to make an investment into it.
p360/p360_096|Buildings are about people.
p360/p360_296|I believe it will happen.
p360/p360_040|It's not been a good year.
p360/p360_395|They could have been told in advance.
p360/p360_288|I have played well the past two days.
p360/p360_169|It is about the script for me.
p360/p360_202|I'm really looking forward to that.
p360/p360_290|That is the key.
p360/p360_056|That view has not altered.
p360/p360_236|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p360/p360_371|I'm working on that one, too.
p360/p360_311|The meaning is very profound and complex.
p360/p360_199|They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
p360/p360_249|We have had our debate.
p360/p360_382|This country has many challenges.
p360/p360_149|He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
p360/p360_270|He is having a nightmare.
p360/p360_232|We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
p360/p360_148|It is deeply frustrating.
p360/p360_107|That would be even more disastrous.
p360/p360_207|The baby was dead.
p360/p360_068|Nor was it a game without its lessons.
p360/p360_324|Hopefully, it will be good enough.
p360/p360_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p360/p360_325|For me, any manager is good.
p360/p360_044|Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
p360/p360_255|Who would have thought it?
p360/p360_158|This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
p360/p360_387|They're all doing it.
p360/p360_392|It is a natural reaction.
p360/p360_299|Why have you decided to get married?
p360/p360_293|I have never been unemployed.
p360/p360_155|First meeting was next week.
p360/p360_394|I had to win this race.
p360/p360_331|This plan is all about respect.
p360/p360_337|A child is not a product.
p360/p360_257|Human beings are always the same.
p360/p360_312|You just have to get on with it.
p360/p360_139|Elections would follow in about two years.
p360/p360_308|We are not physical at all.
p360/p360_419|I don't think they are too serious.
p360/p360_184|I did not see anything to begin with.
p360/p360_401|You will need it.
p360/p360_190|What could we do?
p360/p360_032|Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
p360/p360_034|For once he was wrong.
p360/p360_204|It is dangerous and it is a lie.
p360/p360_043|That has now gone.
p360/p360_087|It seems very odd.
p360/p360_142|Or so it seemed.
p360/p360_113|They took a risk.
p360/p360_417|This was great for our sport.
p360/p360_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p360/p360_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p360/p360_246|Just one of those things, we suppose.
p360/p360_262|He could still be President.
p360/p360_074|That took two weeks.
p360/p360_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p360/p360_388|I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
p360/p360_048|Is he conscious?
p360/p360_256|They were all on a mission.
p360/p360_109|It is looking very special.
p360/p360_187|It was a disaster of a race.
p360/p360_152|Our time is up.
p360/p360_105|I am looking forward to it.
p360/p360_189|Maintain the highest standards.
p360/p360_033|It's something which is very important to me.
p360/p360_188|Only one person can claim the credit.
p360/p360_047|Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
p360/p360_121|They will run a mile.
p360/p360_300|Is it all real?
p360/p360_170|I have a good feeling about this.
p360/p360_231|We've got better players here.
p360/p360_192|But there was no going back.
p360/p360_001|Please call Stella.
p360/p360_407|And he's not alone.
p360/p360_055|But here it is also very bad.
p360/p360_116|It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
p360/p360_330|I have no idea.
p360/p360_181|We are really impressed.
p360/p360_369|I think he will.
p360/p360_254|It seems a shame to leave it.
p360/p360_302|I would not descend to that level.
p360/p360_399|These were the edited highlights.
p360/p360_091|I've always been very taken by the drink.
p360/p360_156|No, we were not exactly favourites.
p360/p360_400|That is the difference.
p360/p360_342|The atmosphere was excellent.
p360/p360_085|He became enchanted with the process.
p360/p360_404|They had three children.
p360/p360_191|O Neill has delivered.
p360/p360_175|There is an ongoing problem with this company.
p360/p360_309|Have we not been here before?
p360/p360_153|It was a moment of madness.
p360/p360_421|There was no happy ending.
p360/p360_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p360/p360_328|He refused to name the survivors.
p360/p360_103|It is harder than you think.
p360/p360_377|Craig is a major concern for us.
p360/p360_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p360/p360_267|The first time you read a play.
p305/p305_101|The party lasted all night.
p305/p305_074|I've come here for the jersey.
p305/p305_379|Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
p305/p305_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p305/p305_402|The place became a war zone.
p305/p305_382|Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
p305/p305_157|We have all been shocked by her death.
p305/p305_208|I believe in the Church.
p305/p305_054|We see little sign of improvement.
p305/p305_175|I got on very well with Allan.
p305/p305_062|That tells you something about them.
p305/p305_305|He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
p305/p305_364|It's a source of deep concern.
p305/p305_143|Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
p305/p305_058|This film will be totally awesome.
p305/p305_377|Farmers have been an endangered species.
p305/p305_001|Please call Stella.
p305/p305_075|It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
p305/p305_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p305/p305_215|Every game against New Zealand is.
p305/p305_119|A lot of things can go wrong.
p305/p305_113|Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
p305/p305_180|So he is open to ideas.
p305/p305_422|The euro is your money, it is our money.
p305/p305_345|I didn't have a trio.
p305/p305_324|Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
p305/p305_349|I hope my successor will do the same.
p305/p305_138|Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
p305/p305_240|I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
p305/p305_197|They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
p305/p305_039|He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
p305/p305_217|He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
p305/p305_132|Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
p305/p305_090|His handling raises a wider issue.
p305/p305_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p305/p305_235|I think we have a very strong case.
p305/p305_395|I can't stop people thinking.
p305/p305_325|Here are some possible solutions.
p305/p305_124|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
p305/p305_367|Last month he made his debut in Japan.
p305/p305_412|Such people do not exist.
p305/p305_091|This is not a recipe for conflict.
p305/p305_220|It may be his last for a while, too.
p305/p305_144|It would have very little impact on them.
p305/p305_346|Their three other children had died as infants.
p305/p305_151|They just made me feel dizzy.
p305/p305_168|In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
p305/p305_162|For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
p305/p305_241|I have been here for only three months.
p305/p305_095|We will have to see, but it makes you think.
p305/p305_280|The case will now go to appeal.
p305/p305_292|Most of the public are behind me.
p305/p305_156|Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
p305/p305_323|We didn't know he was even out.
p305/p305_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p305/p305_310|NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
p305/p305_107|The research is published in the journal, Nature.
p305/p305_191|We want to keep the pound.
p305/p305_123|There has been no delay on government orders.
p305/p305_253|The composer therefore believes he can do it.
p305/p305_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p305/p305_223|The parents will have a great time, too.
p305/p305_065|I am a drug addict.
p305/p305_246|The decision is an absolute disgrace.
p305/p305_275|I am now just a bit uneasy.
p305/p305_115|Each day is a new beginning.
p305/p305_264|He put some colour into Scottish history.
p305/p305_366|But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
p305/p305_206|Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
p305/p305_183|We are expected to do better than before.
p305/p305_167|They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
p305/p305_035|Everyone around the club was supportive.
p305/p305_184|The attacker died in the crash.
p305/p305_278|Yet he chose to do something different.
p305/p305_239|So the process was refined.
p305/p305_238|Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
p305/p305_200|He would help me with the form.
p305/p305_034|We have high hopes that this will work.
p305/p305_353|The fans will support us.
p305/p305_355|It has, however, been a long time coming.
p305/p305_116|My daughter is an adult.
p305/p305_186|Angola was a really hard place.
p305/p305_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p305/p305_268|It's an internal matter.
p305/p305_071|Nancy is not sure how she feels.
p305/p305_299|That's how it worked in Bosnia.
p305/p305_317|The budget was too low for that.
p305/p305_219|Then there's one where people play for fun.
p305/p305_140|Thus far we have received no complaints.
p305/p305_048|I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
p305/p305_045|There was a fine line to tread.
p305/p305_337|That's what it's all about, isn't it?
p305/p305_336|That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
p305/p305_273|I hadn't seen them in eight years.
p305/p305_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p305/p305_230|Everything was up for grabs.
p305/p305_362|It gave me something to focus on.
p305/p305_291|I love the tradition of vaudeville.
p305/p305_213|My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
p305/p305_403|It is not an abortion.
p305/p305_049|Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
p305/p305_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p305/p305_245|How could anyone take issue with that?
p305/p305_187|It is giving out the wrong message.
p305/p305_304|His signature is his handwriting.
p305/p305_361|They too refused to come out and talk.
p305/p305_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p305/p305_232|There will not be any charges.
p305/p305_326|He made so many bad decisions.
p305/p305_391|This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
p305/p305_106|Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
p305/p305_356|The whole team was rubbish.
p305/p305_050|But don't expect an easy ride.
p305/p305_354|It was a long process, but we got there.
p305/p305_306|It also highlighted some local hero districts.
p305/p305_052|Some US embassy staff have left the country.
p305/p305_178|He was lying face down in the water.
p305/p305_363|It's the curse of our time, irony.
p305/p305_287|Surrey police said no body had been found.
p305/p305_330|Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
p305/p305_329|I would have dropped out otherwise.
p305/p305_234|Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
p305/p305_383|We're not an employment agency.
p305/p305_371|The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
p305/p305_231|I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
p305/p305_082|But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
p305/p305_276|However, Sharon rejected the claims.
p305/p305_110|Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
p305/p305_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p305/p305_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p305/p305_339|This time, there were no such rewards.
p305/p305_105|T, Is there anything in the wound?
p305/p305_142|Other people also tried.
p305/p305_394|John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
p305/p305_265|Our offer will remain on the table.
p305/p305_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p305/p305_083|However, it is much bigger than that.
p305/p305_152|He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
p305/p305_190|Tax is a matter for national governments.
p305/p305_303|They made a huge impression on me.
p305/p305_388|Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
p305/p305_296|I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
p305/p305_251|She did not attend the courtroom.
p305/p305_216|That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
p305/p305_226|Appointments should be made on merit.
p305/p305_037|Who has he fought?
p305/p305_256|But there was a shift.
p305/p305_176|That has given me great confidence.
p305/p305_222|Then one night only three people turn up.
p305/p305_370|There has been a big change in defence.
p305/p305_421|Women reported more depression than men.
p305/p305_044|Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
p305/p305_386|It is the logical extension of audio description.
p305/p305_169|That is where the club has gone wrong.
p305/p305_372|There is nothing like a fresh start.
p305/p305_046|They receive a high profile in the media.
p305/p305_149|They chose to side with terror.
p305/p305_283|It was worth a photograph.
p305/p305_316|It is still holding good today.
p305/p305_100|They never looked like winning it either.
p305/p305_194|Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
p305/p305_172|The actor has met with Mandela.
p305/p305_051|In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
p305/p305_118|We've come from a long way back.
p305/p305_148|This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
p305/p305_340|Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
p305/p305_160|Hopefully, now we're getting it.
p305/p305_398|Several people were out in the street.
p305/p305_069|Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
p305/p305_080|If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
p305/p305_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p305/p305_117|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
p305/p305_416|But it is all by design.
p305/p305_312|It's up to their parents to choose.
p305/p305_327|We are now up against it.
p305/p305_285|The road was closed for several hours.
p305/p305_086|He asked me in a tolerance zone.
p305/p305_038|I want a free vote.
p305/p305_211|So people will come out with these things.
p305/p305_041|Players were held in equally low regard.
p305/p305_137|Paterson can afford to be generous.
p305/p305_161|But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
p305/p305_120|He seemed to lose his focus.
p305/p305_130|McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
p305/p305_112|There was an e-mail.
p305/p305_181|Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
p305/p305_135|I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
p305/p305_308|It worked, up to a point.
p305/p305_282|Our nation has been changed by this event.
p305/p305_365|Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
p305/p305_203|I think it was briefly considered.
p305/p305_133|You can never have enough money.
p305/p305_297|This is a very positive step forward.
p305/p305_342|And we still have to pay his salary.
p305/p305_289|We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
p305/p305_189|The sleeper was six hours late.
p305/p305_252|In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
p305/p305_209|Others were even less confident.
p305/p305_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p305/p305_031|I'm happy to contribute to that.
p305/p305_352|We will see how he is.
p305/p305_261|We certainly will need to watch him.
p305/p305_166|The home team also had their moments.
p305/p305_341|I'm just doing artwork.
p305/p305_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p305/p305_418|She can't say where she was, what she did.
p305/p305_384|People might not actually want the job.
p305/p305_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p305/p305_254|I still feel like a wee boy.
p305/p305_202|The minister is the engineer.
p305/p305_224|Now we see the impact of global politics.
p305/p305_378|Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
p305/p305_188|It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
p305/p305_288|My aim is a top six finish.
p305/p305_078|This has not, and has been neglected.
p305/p305_111|It's the way we go about it.
p305/p305_331|They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
p305/p305_335|From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
p305/p305_293|It really is a gift to the world.
p305/p305_249|We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
p305/p305_389|He also was in debt to drug dealers.
p305/p305_047|They were urged to get themselves in order.
p305/p305_373|The company has other problems with the shells.
p305/p305_174|We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
p305/p305_258|Debate was impassioned and furious.
p305/p305_173|Singing has gone out of fashion.
p305/p305_408|I didn't do too badly myself.
p305/p305_182|Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
p305/p305_081|In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
p305/p305_259|The death rates are still as high.
p305/p305_347|We knew nothing about it.
p305/p305_103|It is understood they saw one body.
p305/p305_309|One season, they might do well.
p305/p305_351|Our children are our future.
p305/p305_236|It should be a great game, though.
p305/p305_179|He urged people to forgive.
p305/p305_204|It's a hidden problem.
p305/p305_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p305/p305_405|The surprise is its product is so poor.
p305/p305_150|In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
p305/p305_154|Health care workers and labourers followed.
p305/p305_061|He did the right thing by ignoring me.
p305/p305_401|In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
p305/p305_096|We must keep our feet on the ground.
p305/p305_294|This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
p305/p305_399|There is too much at stake for that.
p305/p305_237|You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
p305/p305_392|The love affair was over.
p305/p305_350|We have got a full house tonight.
p305/p305_409|Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
p305/p305_410|He has never even been to Ireland.
p305/p305_212|You may have a short memory.
p305/p305_233|Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
p305/p305_228|I think we will join the single currency.
p305/p305_088|I drove the ball well.
p305/p305_084|This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
p305/p305_242|They were not doing it too well, either.
p305/p305_089|If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
p305/p305_129|This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
p305/p305_094|Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
p305/p305_070|However, consumers may take a different view.
p305/p305_043|He stands on Centre Court alone.
p305/p305_165|We have already begun to do that here.
p305/p305_028|They keep the atmosphere in mind.
p305/p305_266|He is a man who lives to work.
p305/p305_199|Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
p305/p305_369|Now there is an even bigger target.
p305/p305_164|Scotland need to work on two key areas.
p305/p305_334|The casting of her husband was an accident.
p305/p305_404|It was to get even better for Motherwell.
p305/p305_218|It shows that painting is still relevant.
p305/p305_126|I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
p305/p305_385|The court had a number of empty seats.
p305/p305_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p305/p305_360|They must act now to tighten the rules.
p305/p305_300|Nobody even knew it had happened.
p305/p305_221|They have enough intrusion at the time.
p305/p305_155|Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
p305/p305_375|We're all in a state of shock.
p305/p305_311|We've got a great defensive club.
p305/p305_085|The jury is still out.
p305/p305_281|They really did a great job.
p305/p305_141|I haven't made the donation yet.
p305/p305_193|He needed seven hours of surgery.
p305/p305_131|On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
p305/p305_198|I am saddened to hear of the accident.
p305/p305_030|It is a catalogue of obstruction.
p305/p305_257|Israel has done very little until now.
p305/p305_286|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p305/p305_033|We had a reunion last week.
p305/p305_269|If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
p305/p305_343|Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
p305/p305_027|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
p305/p305_333|One must hope not!
p305/p305_413|We suspect he was pleased.
p305/p305_036|People ask about the concept of a team.
p305/p305_146|My future is in the marathon.
p305/p305_274|Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
p305/p305_076|I'm so proud of my team.
p305/p305_348|I am astonished by this decision.
p305/p305_077|That would open the gates of hell.
p305/p305_227|There have been a lot of lessons learned.
p305/p305_093|You've got it coming Kabul.
p305/p305_185|I am not even thinking about that.
p305/p305_225|Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
p305/p305_214|The whole thing is utterly transparent.
p305/p305_260|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p305/p305_067|This wasn't just a big crowd.
p305/p305_109|They make a selective perception process.
p305/p305_272|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p305/p305_267|The website is now being amended.
p305/p305_201|The actors just have to say so.
p305/p305_320|We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
p305/p305_192|This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
p305/p305_400|A review group will report on Tuesday.
p305/p305_328|It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
p305/p305_210|It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
p305/p305_104|It was a wilful act of violence.
p305/p305_114|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p305/p305_177|This is a dream come true for me.
p305/p305_163|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p305/p305_248|They had had time for little else.
p305/p305_315|I think the Government should pay for that.
p305/p305_066|I've had to take time off work today.
p305/p305_170|I got off to a great start.
p305/p305_307|The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
p305/p305_205|I lost a part of me.
p305/p305_338|When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
p305/p305_318|His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
p305/p305_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p305/p305_380|He was released in March this year.
p305/p305_344|So there's a double whammy.
p305/p305_243|He added, It's not a racial problem.
p305/p305_295|My house was shaking at the time.
p305/p305_321|I know the worry over Iraq.
p305/p305_042|He also admitted possessing a firearm.
p305/p305_411|We believe the squad will stay together.
p305/p305_145|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p305/p305_102|No details of the talks were given.
p305/p305_079|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p305/p305_279|He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
p305/p305_097|My grandparents were terrified.
p305/p305_125|Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
p305/p305_255|He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
p305/p305_271|Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
p305/p305_053|Her mother said she fell off a swing.
p305/p305_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p305/p305_159|He had worked there for only two days.
p305/p305_374|This must have been severe.
p305/p305_376|I thought he was part of the camera.
p305/p305_250|In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
p305/p305_420|Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
p305/p305_393|For some, it was more painful than others.
p305/p305_207|It's part of the game, isn't it?
p305/p305_417|We've still got a say in this.
p305/p305_301|She is a very lucky lady.
p305/p305_319|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
p305/p305_158|We are asking the council to think again.
p305/p305_277|They married in August last year.
p305/p305_134|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
p305/p305_196|Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
p305/p305_057|For example they could be in school uniform.
p305/p305_171|It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
p305/p305_229|Gilbert was not amused.
p305/p305_270|The breakdown was much later in her life.
p305/p305_368|The Dow Jones is way up.
p305/p305_121|It is a vicious circle.
p305/p305_128|Who is the employer?
p305/p305_092|He had done his homework properly.
p305/p305_108|She is a double victim.
p305/p305_025|Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
p305/p305_302|We've been there for seven years.
p305/p305_244|We hope this scheme will change that.
p305/p305_332|I think he has undergone a sea change.
p305/p305_056|Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
p305/p305_060|There is no mandate for a regime change.
p305/p305_068|I wondered about changing back to rugby.
p305/p305_290|Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
p305/p305_284|I love you so very much.
p305/p305_063|The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
p305/p305_298|This is a huge confidence boost.
p305/p305_073|I've put my own money into this project.
p305/p305_415|She always wanted her own way.
p305/p305_099|I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
p305/p305_263|We can only go up.
p305/p305_357|Now we need to keep our heads up.
p305/p305_247|They were at her bedside when she died.
p305/p305_313|I feel privileged to be here.
p305/p305_407|See it while you can.
p305/p305_026|He added, however, that all options are under review.
p305/p305_414|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p305/p305_064|This rule is archaic.
p305/p305_127|How do you respond to losing your child?
p305/p305_098|Are they control freaks?
p305/p305_390|The package has been properly costed.
p305/p305_314|She told me to apply for the crest.
p305/p305_087|For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
p305/p305_262|I don't think it could be clearer.
p305/p305_122|She was eight months pregnant at the time.
p305/p305_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p305/p305_029|Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
p305/p305_032|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p305/p305_358|I put the drawing down.
p305/p305_072|How do you resurrect a dying town?
p305/p305_055|The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
p305/p305_059|Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
p305/p305_153|He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
p305/p305_406|Thus the story will continue to thrive.
p305/p305_419|I'll take what comes along.
p305/p305_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p305/p305_040|It would show them a positive way forward.
p305/p305_139|They do the work, you know.
p305/p305_136|Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
p305/p305_387|It broke up my marriage.
p305/p305_359|They feel it belongs to them.
p305/p305_322|I just could not cope.
p305/p305_397|She had every right to read the warrant.
p305/p305_396|The workers said they were treated like animals.
p305/p305_381|The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
p305/p305_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p305/p305_195|It just came into my head that day.
p305/p305_147|They were even being used by primary pupils.
p298/p298_093|He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
p298/p298_075|She goes to the opening of an envelope.
p298/p298_072|What do they pay to join the club?
p298/p298_126|Will they ever reopen?
p298/p298_183|Two men have been charged with his murder.
p298/p298_154|That gives us something to kick against.
p298/p298_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p298/p298_395|I am just looking to God.
p298/p298_156|Equity declined to comment.
p298/p298_270|His treatment has been quite atrocious.
p298/p298_195|Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
p298/p298_256|Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
p298/p298_058|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p298/p298_245|She has a wonderful mind.
p298/p298_233|Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
p298/p298_055|But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
p298/p298_369|He also has a Scottish grandfather.
p298/p298_349|I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
p298/p298_167|What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
p298/p298_065|It is par for the course, isn't it?
p298/p298_197|They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
p298/p298_041|For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
p298/p298_109|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p298/p298_081|It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
p298/p298_267|I feel very strongly about that.
p298/p298_292|I have been coming here for nine years.
p298/p298_240|They had four children together.
p298/p298_265|I've seen some of the submissions.
p298/p298_052|Who said impatience is a virtue?
p298/p298_108|Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
p298/p298_260|I believe we have a good chance.
p298/p298_355|The boy is no longer with us.
p298/p298_382|We are being hijacked.
p298/p298_302|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p298/p298_296|Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
p298/p298_278|He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
p298/p298_031|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p298/p298_297|That is a job for the Government.
p298/p298_070|Repayment is not part of the game.
p298/p298_129|We have great team spirit.
p298/p298_172|Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
p298/p298_274|My dad was working in Ayrshire.
p298/p298_210|He had taken everything from me.
p298/p298_214|All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
p298/p298_363|Would he be able to live with that?
p298/p298_074|We are now in a safe place.
p298/p298_168|Can they be serious?
p298/p298_044|I will not be in dialogue with her.
p298/p298_049|However, you have just got to adjust to it.
p298/p298_131|He loves the big occasions.
p298/p298_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p298/p298_085|We really need research to help with that.
p298/p298_402|You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
p298/p298_132|They should take their mobile phones.
p298/p298_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p298/p298_174|I think we showed that after half time.
p298/p298_299|And he had much need.
p298/p298_198|The Government faces a moral dilemma.
p298/p298_300|Last night the bombardment was terrible.
p298/p298_150|It was fit for royalty.
p298/p298_223|Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
p298/p298_125|I asked why he had come.
p298/p298_136|It was to be published next month.
p298/p298_163|It's now down in black and white.
p298/p298_104|It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
p298/p298_092|These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
p298/p298_281|What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
p298/p298_309|No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
p298/p298_234|Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
p298/p298_362|As if he were a High Court judge.
p298/p298_117|And it's more subversive.
p298/p298_073|Two people are allowed to share the duty.
p298/p298_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p298/p298_261|Things were not easy from the outset.
p298/p298_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p298/p298_327|They will want to watch a winning team.
p298/p298_403|The new work will begin in the autumn.
p298/p298_324|I'll go out and be aggressive.
p298/p298_289|Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
p298/p298_057|It was more like a Labour Party rally.
p298/p298_351|An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
p298/p298_232|The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
p298/p298_155|Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
p298/p298_328|Who is going to be penalised?
p298/p298_184|Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
p298/p298_373|I might also completely change the routine.
p298/p298_206|Most of them were one-year conscripts.
p298/p298_035|They are interior designers and architects.
p298/p298_360|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
p298/p298_061|The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
p298/p298_368|It was also put on the Internet.
p298/p298_237|But one shouldn't go by that.
p298/p298_345|And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
p298/p298_238|Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
p298/p298_221|We have our supporters and our enemies.
p298/p298_346|I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
p298/p298_091|There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
p298/p298_388|The damage from the fire was huge.
p298/p298_293|I felt under no pressure today.
p298/p298_078|We just try to make great records.
p298/p298_399|Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
p298/p298_139|Subs not used, Fernandez.
p298/p298_326|What is the truth about the cow?
p298/p298_089|It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
p298/p298_060|Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
p298/p298_202|I am not a happy man.
p298/p298_230|This could be one such case, he declared.
p298/p298_253|Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
p298/p298_138|It could have been a hammering by now.
p298/p298_370|Now that was a boxing movie.
p298/p298_145|But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
p298/p298_047|It was an easy decision to come here.
p298/p298_216|People are so negative about the whole business.
p298/p298_343|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p298/p298_038|It was a crucial moment.
p298/p298_282|She had been sexually assaulted.
p298/p298_340|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p298/p298_341|Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
p298/p298_290|If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
p298/p298_376|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p298/p298_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p298/p298_114|The cold war is over.
p298/p298_062|Don't say you have not been warned.
p298/p298_316|Tony Blair, can you see her face?
p298/p298_127|After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
p298/p298_301|This can only help us go forward.
p298/p298_141|It's a bit like a bereavement.
p298/p298_079|She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
p298/p298_273|It is now very clear that doesn't work.
p298/p298_401|The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
p298/p298_084|Audacious decisions were taken early on.
p298/p298_386|This is a long-term discussion paper.
p298/p298_313|Rapid revision was required.
p298/p298_077|He was obviously very genuine.
p298/p298_185|The guys have really enjoyed it.
p298/p298_182|They just would not have run away.
p298/p298_119|Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
p298/p298_213|They should also have the right to vote.
p298/p298_356|Staff should be paid for what they produce.
p298/p298_194|We know them as mobile telephones.
p298/p298_250|But first it goes out on TV.
p298/p298_083|His parenthood is called into question.
p298/p298_190|English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
p298/p298_157|There is precious little middle ground.
p298/p298_144|That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
p298/p298_377|I have learned a lot from him.
p298/p298_331|Just see where the blood is coming from.
p298/p298_325|I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
p298/p298_189|It is simple and easy to use.
p298/p298_372|There was a battle there.
p298/p298_365|That kind of growth is the important thing.
p298/p298_269|After that nothing could save him.
p298/p298_151|It is always the same, isn't it?
p298/p298_347|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
p298/p298_120|After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
p298/p298_307|Last week, he was taken into hospital.
p298/p298_068|Some people still think she should be English.
p298/p298_295|And that was the adults.
p298/p298_235|I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
p298/p298_344|Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
p298/p298_389|Both agreed on the success of the event.
p298/p298_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p298/p298_146|What was going through her mind that day, that night?
p298/p298_176|A wide range of restrictions are in place.
p298/p298_080|I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
p298/p298_338|I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
p298/p298_342|I get to work with very good people.
p298/p298_358|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p298/p298_357|I would urge the Government to think again.
p298/p298_312|We have the location, which is assured.
p298/p298_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p298/p298_115|I'd like to take the plunge.
p298/p298_165|It is quite an eye opener.
p298/p298_103|He went to see what he could learn.
p298/p298_222|She has now been registered as disabled.
p298/p298_284|Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
p298/p298_094|Scotland were beaten again.
p298/p298_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p298/p298_227|It's been a long, long journey.
p298/p298_148|All kinds of things occur.
p298/p298_160|They were both delightful to work with.
p298/p298_027|This was the classical period of Beethoven.
p298/p298_098|She is on a life support machine.
p298/p298_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p298/p298_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p298/p298_053|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p298/p298_118|We are losing this war.
p298/p298_353|This represents a tough game for us.
p298/p298_173|We are all family men with children.
p298/p298_375|It's good news and long overdue.
p298/p298_218|We didn't know if people would turn up.
p298/p298_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p298/p298_379|I have beaten her a few times.
p298/p298_332|I have a theory.
p298/p298_337|Sentence was deferred for background reports.
p298/p298_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p298/p298_304|Andrew McLellan is no exception.
p298/p298_209|He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
p298/p298_286|We have been treated with complete contempt.
p298/p298_305|His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
p298/p298_133|He loved his job and working in newspapers.
p298/p298_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p298/p298_404|The written judgment was issued in printed form.
p298/p298_246|There are just two tournaments remaining.
p298/p298_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p298/p298_226|This Government believes in parental discipline.
p298/p298_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p298/p298_090|Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
p298/p298_257|They seem to be backing off from that.
p298/p298_381|So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
p298/p298_308|He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
p298/p298_099|Their vision was not impeded.
p298/p298_030|Any error of judgment was ruled out.
p298/p298_101|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p298/p298_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p298/p298_097|I've done it almost like a variety show.
p298/p298_186|Charles Clarke is an idiot.
p298/p298_059|The partnership was set up during the summer.
p298/p298_378|He has been campaigning for change for years.
p298/p298_033|I think they should have more respect.
p298/p298_034|The crackdown is launched today by the government.
p298/p298_137|Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
p298/p298_266|There is no such thing.
p298/p298_371|Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
p298/p298_247|We're into that build-up now.
p298/p298_106|The luxury has been well used.
p298/p298_208|I don't honestly know how to describe it.
p298/p298_107|Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
p298/p298_394|However, in October another partnership was announced.
p298/p298_105|Referees are easy targets.
p298/p298_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p298/p298_391|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p298/p298_128|A lot of people were in tears.
p298/p298_390|But we'll just keep trying to get results.
p298/p298_217|They had given up on him.
p298/p298_063|That is a mark of what you are.
p298/p298_339|Some of his family still live there.
p298/p298_288|It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
p298/p298_405|He showed he has some things to learn.
p298/p298_374|Today's ruling confirms that fact.
p298/p298_040|I let go the telephone and ran.
p298/p298_263|We've had great things in the past.
p298/p298_164|Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
p298/p298_277|Last year, however, was a different story.
p298/p298_314|What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
p298/p298_392|We have to offer value for money.
p298/p298_311|That was moving the goalposts.
p298/p298_306|Some have other commitments.
p298/p298_396|The woman is basically off her head.
p298/p298_383|Mike Tyson went to prison.
p298/p298_225|It did my image a lot of good!
p298/p298_042|His charisma is all on the course.
p298/p298_279|I bought a car at auction.
p298/p298_283|Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
p298/p298_220|You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
p298/p298_280|And who were they anyway, beforehand?
p298/p298_393|There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
p298/p298_087|There were no passengers on board.
p298/p298_354|He saw it all as a big game.
p298/p298_028|That is just a load of baloney.
p298/p298_251|We're trying to lessen the stigma.
p298/p298_152|Who would take it now, after all this?
p298/p298_380|They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
p298/p298_159|The inquiry had been going on for months.
p298/p298_192|I think we finished fifth.
p298/p298_201|It was a very difficult decision for us.
p298/p298_171|It's just that we see different things.
p298/p298_361|I'm delighted with how he has come through.
p298/p298_236|We're still talking with a few people.
p298/p298_088|At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
p298/p298_350|People tended to stay there for some time.
p298/p298_319|They had previously been on five-day notice.
p298/p298_158|She was shouting my baby, my baby.
p298/p298_385|This is the first stage of catching up.
p298/p298_231|I fell in love with ballet.
p298/p298_275|There are lots of these women in Finland.
p298/p298_177|There was pressure from elsewhere too.
p298/p298_110|There was no time scale.
p298/p298_066|Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
p298/p298_322|It is too early to speculate.
p298/p298_243|How can they engage with the work?
p298/p298_086|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p298/p298_320|I am proud of those guys.
p298/p298_241|Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
p298/p298_200|But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
p298/p298_025|It is bad news for the flooded areas.
p298/p298_095|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p298/p298_178|You let a lot of people down.
p298/p298_398|Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
p298/p298_335|Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
p298/p298_166|Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
p298/p298_113|Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
p298/p298_069|Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
p298/p298_310|The crowd was awesome.
p298/p298_259|Do you think you have a shot?
p298/p298_181|We aren't going to play better.
p298/p298_032|The feeling is marvellous.
p298/p298_224|I was living with my mum.
p298/p298_064|Seven children had lost both parents.
p298/p298_317|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p298/p298_169|For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
p298/p298_096|The League of Nations was also his idea.
p298/p298_187|Our people should be immune.
p298/p298_215|WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
p298/p298_111|Only the scale of change differed.
p298/p298_291|The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
p298/p298_039|We gave everything we had.
p298/p298_161|It's my delight on a shiny night.
p298/p298_050|I saw them not long after it happened.
p298/p298_400|The South African defended his work ethic.
p298/p298_323|She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
p298/p298_124|John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
p298/p298_333|In her opinion, the rich are different.
p298/p298_122|I've got no secret.
p298/p298_268|It is a difficult thing to explain.
p298/p298_330|The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
p298/p298_026|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p298/p298_199|The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
p298/p298_147|I always knew she was funny.
p298/p298_287|There is no smoking gun.
p298/p298_051|This guy is never going to give up.
p298/p298_082|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p298/p298_207|The line-up is a tasty one.
p298/p298_140|I played really well on the back nine.
p298/p298_229|But there has never been the time, she said.
p298/p298_255|We have reacted well to each other.
p298/p298_272|Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
p298/p298_043|This is purely financial.
p298/p298_352|My preference is for the single vaccines.
p298/p298_212|Suspension will come into force at midnight.
p298/p298_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p298/p298_121|They will know they deserve to be there.
p298/p298_153|I felt really good until Friday.
p298/p298_175|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p298/p298_367|And a film maker was born.
p298/p298_219|It has made me feel good.
p298/p298_264|Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
p298/p298_384|She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
p298/p298_364|I'm looking at ways to do that now.
p298/p298_001|Please call Stella.
p298/p298_056|Several hundred people attended yesterday.
p298/p298_252|Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
p298/p298_262|She may even appear in some more films.
p298/p298_048|I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
p298/p298_248|It is the end of an era.
p298/p298_366|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p298/p298_315|We couldn't go very fast.
p298/p298_130|Above all the aggression must be stopped.
p298/p298_318|We have grown up in Britain.
p298/p298_193|It was not a foul.
p298/p298_100|Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
p298/p298_321|It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
p298/p298_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p298/p298_285|They are so easy for youngsters to open.
p298/p298_204|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
p298/p298_170|That, in our view, is an important decision.
p298/p298_329|I feel sorry for the Reds.
p298/p298_143|Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
p298/p298_348|I can appear to be nice and lovely.
p298/p298_135|I first met him last summer.
p298/p298_336|Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
p298/p298_162|I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
p298/p298_112|Tell you the team he picked?
p298/p298_258|They have a very good method of working.
p298/p298_271|It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
p298/p298_076|It will be very useful for us.
p298/p298_228|That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
p298/p298_102|Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
p298/p298_239|I think in three dimensions.
p298/p298_149|I expected these kind of questions.
p298/p298_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p298/p298_397|The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
p298/p298_294|The Devil is the creator of weapons.
p298/p298_029|I was never going to play against Scotland.
p298/p298_071|The cause of the crash was unclear.
p298/p298_191|The rear of the plane was on fire.
p298/p298_116|Lately, that market has come under pressure.
p298/p298_067|Most people know that.
p298/p298_254|I learned a lot from her.
p298/p298_334|Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
p298/p298_276|Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
p298/p298_036|Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
p298/p298_123|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p298/p298_045|Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
p298/p298_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p298/p298_211|Many, many people don't know who he is.
p298/p298_249|We can just get on with our game.
p298/p298_134|We have big ideas.
p298/p298_387|In all cases computer equipment was seized.
p298/p298_244|All were later allowed home.
p298/p298_359|I was happiest with my short game.
p298/p298_046|I did not want any damage to us.
p298/p298_188|Glasgow then took control.
p298/p298_196|I don't know exactly what happened.
p298/p298_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p298/p298_203|You can be sure we will have problems.
p298/p298_037|Others may be trying to catch up.
p298/p298_303|But, even so, you always want to try something new.
p298/p298_205|I'm going with all three.
p298/p298_242|Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
p298/p298_179|One person was believed to have been hit.
p298/p298_298|I felt the head was very like me.
p298/p298_142|It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
p298/p298_054|You've got to have everything inside with you.
p298/p298_180|Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
p232/p232_045|It is urgent.
p232/p232_077|It was chaotic.
p232/p232_321|Davis is very supportive, as a director.
p232/p232_151|It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
p232/p232_223|It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
p232/p232_268|Of course, that is not the whole story.
p232/p232_359|She is free.
p232/p232_051|Here's a clue.
p232/p232_361|I kept going for her.
p232/p232_252|We did not compete with any other local farmer.
p232/p232_290|I saw it at a ruck.
p232/p232_095|I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
p232/p232_276|Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
p232/p232_362|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p232/p232_122|The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
p232/p232_080|I've got the shirt.
p232/p232_152|It was by the numbers.
p232/p232_078|It is a job creation scheme.
p232/p232_128|Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
p232/p232_367|He has seen the past.
p232/p232_335|She did not attend the courtroom.
p232/p232_370|We will be homeless.
p232/p232_260|The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
p232/p232_297|These figures are truly awful.
p232/p232_104|There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
p232/p232_108|He pleaded for caution.
p232/p232_342|That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
p232/p232_332|Horses are drawn by ballot.
p232/p232_046|The judge said.
p232/p232_237|However, no further action was taken by police.
p232/p232_111|He was jailed for a year.
p232/p232_193|The procedure is the same in all cases.
p232/p232_241|It's quite nice.
p232/p232_079|He is now resident in England.
p232/p232_254|Some families have even requested to leave the city.
p232/p232_408|Feel the air, the space.
p232/p232_048|But it might have done.
p232/p232_121|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p232/p232_303|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p232/p232_309|We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
p232/p232_329|We agreed to disagree.
p232/p232_305|They are wrong.
p232/p232_029|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p232/p232_347|Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
p232/p232_187|I've been there.
p232/p232_001|Please call Stella.
p232/p232_287|It happens from time to time.
p232/p232_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p232/p232_160|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p232/p232_073|There could be a way back.
p232/p232_391|You thought it was a headache.
p232/p232_330|It could have gone either way.
p232/p232_110|I don't have many friends.
p232/p232_249|Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
p232/p232_311|Special measures were needed.
p232/p232_405|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
p232/p232_123|An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
p232/p232_092|Today I couldn't run on it.
p232/p232_034|It is marvellous.
p232/p232_369|To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
p232/p232_043|But it took a lot of bottle.
p232/p232_173|It became a book by itself.
p232/p232_227|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p232/p232_326|It's not long enough.
p232/p232_412|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p232/p232_175|You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
p232/p232_315|Kids are terrible.
p232/p232_106|It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
p232/p232_393|A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
p232/p232_137|The goals were good.
p232/p232_097|The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
p232/p232_299|He has retired.
p232/p232_163|It is not too late to get on board.
p232/p232_228|It was good fun.
p232/p232_214|She should not be blamed.
p232/p232_176|First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
p232/p232_295|Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
p232/p232_099|They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
p232/p232_141|She died at her home.
p232/p232_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p232/p232_058|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p232/p232_314|We are a peaceful people.
p232/p232_063|You do not change overnight.
p232/p232_044|We will push.
p232/p232_138|What will happen then?
p232/p232_091|It is a lifeline.
p232/p232_167|Waiting times for these services are too long.
p232/p232_169|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p232/p232_127|It has removed a bit of guilt.
p232/p232_320|Referees are easy targets.
p232/p232_189|They receive a high profile in the media.
p232/p232_211|Feel the heat?
p232/p232_286|It was a privilege to work for him.
p232/p232_346|Tiger is the exception.
p232/p232_246|He claimed the government had lost the plot.
p232/p232_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p232/p232_280|Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
p232/p232_100|It was mayhem.
p232/p232_139|I am totally devoted to this job.
p232/p232_198|The conference is the first test.
p232/p232_155|This latter point is hugely important.
p232/p232_067|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p232/p232_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p232/p232_054|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p232/p232_371|The scene is about this?
p232/p232_074|Then followed a bout of flu.
p232/p232_179|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p232/p232_348|That is the very reason why it was so vital.
p232/p232_071|Painful, but only because it's true.
p232/p232_209|There was an e-mail.
p232/p232_148|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p232/p232_203|A deadline is still essential.
p232/p232_333|I'd like to take the plunge.
p232/p232_266|They want to shut the Scottish Office.
p232/p232_075|The price cuts are really exciting.
p232/p232_399|Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
p232/p232_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p232/p232_147|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p232/p232_062|The problems are a result of that shortfall.
p232/p232_221|Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
p232/p232_053|It's the big omission.
p232/p232_049|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p232/p232_093|However, it did not end that way.
p232/p232_244|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p232/p232_322|However, the groups denied the claims.
p232/p232_389|It has moved on in the last week.
p232/p232_158|They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
p232/p232_414|I was very young.
p232/p232_129|The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
p232/p232_219|He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
p232/p232_180|The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
p232/p232_317|Craig is a major concern for us.
p232/p232_072|That was the easy election.
p232/p232_186|It is the whole package.
p232/p232_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p232/p232_183|Everyone can be bought.
p232/p232_243|It's a lovely, lovely film.
p232/p232_316|It should be equal.
p232/p232_251|Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
p232/p232_380|I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
p232/p232_239|It is set in Paris.
p232/p232_206|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p232/p232_283|I am an estate agent.
p232/p232_282|The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
p232/p232_142|I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
p232/p232_398|But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
p232/p232_202|The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
p232/p232_340|Who will do it?
p232/p232_216|He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
p232/p232_166|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p232/p232_105|That is no use.
p232/p232_258|He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
p232/p232_285|They were on holiday in Egypt.
p232/p232_164|That must be left to the Parole Board.
p232/p232_410|I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
p232/p232_263|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p232/p232_070|There is an element of racism in Scotland.
p232/p232_267|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p232/p232_196|I came home by ambulance.
p232/p232_259|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p232/p232_132|I am now unemployed.
p232/p232_312|There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
p232/p232_386|That left a bad taste in my mouth.
p232/p232_357|He had played well in that central role.
p232/p232_415|We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
p232/p232_120|It is rubbish.
p232/p232_083|That is bound to happen.
p232/p232_318|The home team had an amazing start.
p232/p232_294|A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
p232/p232_365|However, it was well worth the wait.
p232/p232_413|It was that bad, that low.
p232/p232_300|What has altered?
p232/p232_035|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p232/p232_324|We think all other measures are not exhausted.
p232/p232_094|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p232/p232_388|Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
p232/p232_200|He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
p232/p232_171|My life has been destroyed.
p232/p232_409|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p232/p232_066|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p232/p232_090|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p232/p232_136|They took a risk.
p232/p232_232|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p232/p232_376|He could make it.
p232/p232_081|Today she has been released.
p232/p232_360|It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
p232/p232_069|We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
p232/p232_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p232/p232_038|It was fit for royalty.
p232/p232_400|It will probably take me just days to spend it.
p232/p232_231|I'd never seen a play about me.
p232/p232_240|The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
p232/p232_302|Nothing is safe.
p232/p232_125|I'm so angry.
p232/p232_310|He was solid.
p232/p232_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p232/p232_153|I was in daily contact.
p232/p232_313|I never thought it would take this long.
p232/p232_372|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p232/p232_102|It was a good performance.
p232/p232_055|It's very odd.
p232/p232_188|Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
p232/p232_298|He should have won.
p232/p232_159|We have to move forward.
p232/p232_306|It is a road of death.
p232/p232_027|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p232/p232_068|It is like a river running by my home.
p232/p232_119|This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
p232/p232_118|Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
p232/p232_217|It's not ideal.
p232/p232_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p232/p232_146|It was deployed in the Gulf War.
p232/p232_261|One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
p232/p232_293|The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
p232/p232_040|Dancing was her life.
p232/p232_403|My house was shaking at the time.
p232/p232_033|I would love it.
p232/p232_184|A career as a doctor is on hold.
p232/p232_250|He says that he is no different from any other man.
p232/p232_060|That is very hard, alone.
p232/p232_230|I am immensely sad.
p232/p232_161|We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
p232/p232_162|Tell it like it was?
p232/p232_368|It was one in the afternoon.
p232/p232_323|I came into this world with nothing.
p232/p232_404|This is a huge confidence boost.
p232/p232_086|She had kept the news from him.
p232/p232_220|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p232/p232_150|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p232/p232_395|We're looking for justice.
p232/p232_238|And thought we would get away with it.
p232/p232_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p232/p232_215|His third goal was superb.
p232/p232_088|Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
p232/p232_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p232/p232_115|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
p232/p232_039|I was scared.
p232/p232_089|Now the system is right behind us.
p232/p232_385|I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
p232/p232_307|The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
p232/p232_273|He was also married with two children.
p232/p232_255|It's a record label, not a form of music.
p232/p232_113|It's not fair.
p232/p232_225|We've got the bronze.
p232/p232_213|He is slightly confused.
p232/p232_042|You must always attempt to raise the bar.
p232/p232_140|He is severe.
p232/p232_233|The track is currently covered in snow.
p232/p232_112|You had better believe it.
p232/p232_349|I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
p232/p232_278|They wanted the club to make money.
p232/p232_234|But she was.
p232/p232_201|On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
p232/p232_130|Offered the gold medal, he declined.
p232/p232_134|You've got to be vigilant.
p232/p232_384|There is no signature.
p232/p232_037|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p232/p232_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p232/p232_396|I can lead by example.
p232/p232_253|I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
p232/p232_392|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p232/p232_319|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p232/p232_343|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p232/p232_257|I can't get a job.
p232/p232_082|What has changed?
p232/p232_224|That has been the easy part.
p232/p232_172|They thought they had found a home.
p232/p232_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p232/p232_191|I wish I could say something.
p232/p232_190|We did everything by the book.
p232/p232_301|I thought it was my only chance.
p232/p232_352|The boat was fantastic.
p232/p232_363|But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
p232/p232_269|The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
p232/p232_242|It's quite a line-up!
p232/p232_185|Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
p232/p232_199|The service from the other players was super.
p232/p232_116|Maybe this battle has been.
p232/p232_156|It is an attitude of mind.
p232/p232_397|I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
p232/p232_331|He was then replaced by Ross.
p232/p232_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p232/p232_390|That's the name of the game, though.
p232/p232_143|They did very well.
p232/p232_291|They were also beside themselves.
p232/p232_292|The attacker died in the crash.
p232/p232_168|That will do for me.
p232/p232_379|They have not done so this season so far.
p232/p232_036|But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
p232/p232_264|The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
p232/p232_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p232/p232_061|The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
p232/p232_182|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p232/p232_065|He was popular.
p232/p232_084|I will miss him.
p232/p232_149|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
p232/p232_028|They should be so lucky.
p232/p232_135|Our intentions are real.
p232/p232_114|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p232/p232_192|Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
p232/p232_059|That's the truth.
p232/p232_339|They haven't got a hope.
p232/p232_101|They were outside the circle.
p232/p232_050|They had to explain it.
p232/p232_308|We are in the end game.
p232/p232_026|But it failed.
p232/p232_117|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p232/p232_402|We knew nothing about it.
p232/p232_350|Chambers said he would accept the place.
p232/p232_364|It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
p232/p232_207|I don't want to use it.
p232/p232_103|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p232/p232_262|It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
p232/p232_208|Now, it's all right.
p232/p232_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p232/p232_374|The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
p232/p232_341|Gaelic provision continued to be good.
p232/p232_124|That's all right then.
p232/p232_271|Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
p232/p232_107|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p232/p232_248|A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
p232/p232_064|People love to see this stuff.
p232/p232_256|A friendship that will endure.
p232/p232_204|We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
p232/p232_052|We were surprised to see the photograph.
p232/p232_031|It's a matter of balance.
p232/p232_087|No progress has been made.
p232/p232_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p232/p232_377|For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
p232/p232_144|The home side didn't stand a chance.
p232/p232_109|He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
p232/p232_096|Then came the crunch.
p232/p232_076|I had my suspicions.
p232/p232_334|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p232/p232_355|On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
p232/p232_272|He is a young man with a new deal.
p232/p232_181|The clarity is vital.
p232/p232_337|His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
p232/p232_131|That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
p232/p232_288|He looked very sharp.
p232/p232_133|If not, a deal could take many months.
p232/p232_373|Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
p232/p232_178|It's the real thing, for sure.
p232/p232_265|Blood samples were taken.
p232/p232_154|They were later discharged from hospital.
p232/p232_194|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p232/p232_195|I wanted to put myself on the line.
p232/p232_274|Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
p232/p232_098|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p232/p232_170|We've made a couple of albums.
p232/p232_327|My view has now completely changed.
p232/p232_281|It's a way of life.
p232/p232_354|It is long gone.
p232/p232_041|I suspect the latter.
p232/p232_030|They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
p232/p232_353|Like his acting, it was an accident.
p232/p232_284|The record companies have gone through the floor.
p232/p232_174|I always felt they played for me.
p232/p232_375|It was a double tragedy for the family.
p232/p232_270|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p232/p232_085|It's all going to clear the debt.
p232/p232_275|Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
p232/p232_056|Because we do not need it.
p232/p232_387|It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
p232/p232_229|What was the main difference?
p232/p232_245|Broke the birdie record.
p232/p232_226|Mental health is a massive issue.
p232/p232_277|She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
p232/p232_236|We were awful.
p232/p232_378|The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
p232/p232_235|Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
p232/p232_032|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p232/p232_338|The team for the first game could be this one.
p232/p232_047|It is difficult for Ali.
p232/p232_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p232/p232_205|It's a mixture of everything.
p232/p232_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p232/p232_345|Indeed, it was magical.
p232/p232_344|He has to learn.
p232/p232_366|It benefits the whole family.
p232/p232_381|Well, the big day has arrived.
p232/p232_218|He seemed to lose his focus.
p232/p232_197|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p232/p232_411|You wanted the evidence.
p232/p232_145|We want to see the maximum of change.
p232/p232_210|That's the day job.
p232/p232_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p232/p232_296|He was obviously very genuine.
p232/p232_358|It's not that clear-cut.
p232/p232_394|The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
p232/p232_328|They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
p232/p232_325|Off with their heads.
p232/p232_382|Five members were disciplined.
p232/p232_406|He was a crazy man.
p232/p232_289|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p232/p232_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p232/p232_407|We should have known.
p232/p232_383|Talks are progressing.
p232/p232_279|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p232/p232_351|Everything was an effort.
p232/p232_336|It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
p232/p232_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p232/p232_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p232/p232_057|It's not pretty, but it's effective.
p232/p232_025|Johnson was pretty low.
p232/p232_401|It is legally binding.
p232/p232_165|Again, we were lucky.
p232/p232_177|Blair's response was weak.
p232/p232_126|Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
p232/p232_356|That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
p232/p232_247|She is well balanced.
s5/s5_268|His own boys say the same about him.
s5/s5_312|I hope numbers will be up on last time.
s5/s5_084|Campbell said he hoped to build on that fighting spirit against Hearts.
s5/s5_166|But, overall, Aberdeen looks well placed for growth.
s5/s5_214|It is not a natural choice for them.
s5/s5_087|Tony Blair is taking a computer course.
s5/s5_340|That has been the story all through this season, really.
s5/s5_100|It's hardly a new strategy in art practice.
s5/s5_229|He has many offers from the English Premiership.
s5/s5_258|I've had to take time off work today.
s5/s5_384|It was the September weekend after all.
s5/s5_252|Is there a waiting list?
s5/s5_220|Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
s5/s5_323|We even changed the system three times but it didn't help.
s5/s5_131|So, did she meet him?
s5/s5_253|Do they think anyone else wants them ?
s5/s5_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
s5/s5_061|These figures cover the major British banking groups.
s5/s5_351|It was another black day for Ayrshire.
s5/s5_349|Local and national phone calls will be free.
s5/s5_198|We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
s5/s5_217|We've had five weeks with two games really.
s5/s5_313|I was better prepared than a year ago.
s5/s5_346|Perhaps we should learn something from them.
s5/s5_058|He will just go on doing his job.
s5/s5_063|It had little effect on European equity markets.
s5/s5_358|In football terms, though, Kilmarnock are well in the black.
s5/s5_205|The hotel has a long and happy history.
s5/s5_096|I bought a flat six years ago.
s5/s5_075|Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
s5/s5_200|Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
s5/s5_156|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
s5/s5_393|After the match, do you?
s5/s5_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
s5/s5_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
s5/s5_083|The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
s5/s5_143|No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
s5/s5_394|This trial has brought the focus back on the inquiry.
s5/s5_124|Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
s5/s5_286|was everything done to save people?
s5/s5_126|In our view the stock has financial risk.
s5/s5_062|They said construction work could begin within weeks.
s5/s5_322|Friday night was a pretty good night.
s5/s5_167|The site was launched in the UK on Monday.
s5/s5_147|Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
s5/s5_364|We are keen to see truth and justice.
s5/s5_106|Britain will lead demands for the reform of Europe.
s5/s5_067|We're moving from four companies into a single company.
s5/s5_196|I had several words with the fourth official and was warned.
s5/s5_150|Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
s5/s5_365|The Farmer is doing the whole of August.
s5/s5_291|If he could have taken those words back, he would have.
s5/s5_305|I try to be open to experience.
s5/s5_283|Larsson is clearly the form player just now.
s5/s5_389|Is it worth it?
s5/s5_327|You get better at putting on a face for the world.
s5/s5_127|I am not under any new pressure.
s5/s5_192|Full details are expected to be released in June.
s5/s5_135|Are you going to win?
s5/s5_263|The best thing for me was to join the Army.
s5/s5_359|Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
s5/s5_264|In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
s5/s5_038|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
s5/s5_177|Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
s5/s5_123|Now the system is right behind us.
s5/s5_262|They had asked not to be named.
s5/s5_353|And so it is with young companies.
s5/s5_330|Do you think we are a top nation?
s5/s5_040|I am secure in my own position.
s5/s5_072|The management team has a hard task ahead.
s5/s5_149|Surely it can't run for two years.
s5/s5_250|Its primary business channel is the internet.
s5/s5_195|Gas production was also at record levels last year.
s5/s5_085|I can't remember a lot about the accident.
s5/s5_295|She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
s5/s5_043|For career reasons, too, he believed he needed to come home.
s5/s5_142|It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
s5/s5_400|I saw one man vote five times.
s5/s5_399|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
s5/s5_125|We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
s5/s5_231|Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
s5/s5_378|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
s5/s5_269|We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
s5/s5_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
s5/s5_076|How are you, sir?
s5/s5_046|However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
s5/s5_318|Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
s5/s5_092|When I went down I knew it was bad.
s5/s5_057|First Choice is the clear leader in terms of performance.
s5/s5_326|We are putting in place training programmes to improve skills.
s5/s5_136|They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
s5/s5_271|He remains a main board director of Royal.
s5/s5_197|Opera must get its house in order
s5/s5_117|Six public bodies are behind the plan.
s5/s5_232|I'd rather play well next week than here.
s5/s5_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
s5/s5_091|It is no longer the white death.
s5/s5_297|The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
s5/s5_119|It has too few of its own special forces inside Kosovo.
s5/s5_213|Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
s5/s5_115|The potential is always in the idea.
s5/s5_367|Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
s5/s5_207|Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
s5/s5_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
s5/s5_352|Neither issued any statement after the hearing.
s5/s5_348|Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.
s5/s5_308|If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
s5/s5_255|But I'm a lot of other things, too.
s5/s5_001|Please call Stella.
s5/s5_311|They bought the property four years ago.
s5/s5_309|Their job is to show whether any disease remains.
s5/s5_145|As our national coach, Brown is done for.
s5/s5_225|It is my decision and my decision alone.
s5/s5_355|It's always a difficult game against England.
s5/s5_301|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
s5/s5_382|Jones said she was there to show my complete support for my husband.
s5/s5_148|That will reduce my chance of selection.
s5/s5_088|There is no issue of national security involved here.
s5/s5_077|So is that it, then?
s5/s5_028|On his first public appearance, Mr Cameron found himself under fire.
s5/s5_233|I know that you have a love of Scotland.
s5/s5_360|Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the American university, confirmed the appointment yesterday.
s5/s5_310|One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
s5/s5_273|They first met during a Step in London.
s5/s5_201|People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
s5/s5_158|The property has been for sale for several months.
s5/s5_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
s5/s5_098|They are a different team at home.
s5/s5_173|A great player has to win major championships.
s5/s5_102|His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
s5/s5_259|I enjoyed this summer, which is a big difference from last year.
s5/s5_372|The two cases are about exactly the same thing.
s5/s5_025|The west coast line is not just for middle England.
s5/s5_041|The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
s5/s5_187|This will take in dividend policy and capital structure.
s5/s5_277|The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
s5/s5_191|I've never had a year like this.
s5/s5_175|I'm just as concerned about life and death as you are.
s5/s5_139|We're currently looking at the level of support.
s5/s5_226|People like him give rugby a good name.
s5/s5_093|It's allowed in the rules he said later.
s5/s5_227|Church leaders warned other homes could close.
s5/s5_065|I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
s5/s5_395|That had happened long before half-time yesterday.
s5/s5_314|Put another way, they just won't do it.
s5/s5_053|But you have to give credit to Dunfermline.
s5/s5_333|What form did that take?
s5/s5_155|He said some things which were better left alone.
s5/s5_204|I do not see this so much as failure.
s5/s5_078|Do I have a favourite?
s5/s5_276|The strong performance is expected to continue.
s5/s5_113|The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
s5/s5_112|We control every part of your life.
s5/s5_240|Does the name matter ?
s5/s5_029|Thomson and his family left court without comment.
s5/s5_331|Is our children learning?
s5/s5_356|The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
s5/s5_128|The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
s5/s5_300|We still think this trade is on the increase.
s5/s5_086|The campaign ran in Lothian, Fife and Central Scotland police areas.
s5/s5_110|I think there's not much between them.
s5/s5_116|That is the only way to rate players.
s5/s5_328|His style was direct and very human.
s5/s5_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
s5/s5_153|That is a big risk at any price.
s5/s5_387|Had this been common practice?
s5/s5_044|He did very well, but didn't win.
s5/s5_337|Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
s5/s5_354|He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
s5/s5_199|It comes down to the police in England.
s5/s5_242|What are you not good at ?
s5/s5_111|We backed away from writing new songs.
s5/s5_184|You were made to feel so welcome.
s5/s5_134|What happened in that game?
s5/s5_169|I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
s5/s5_373|The play was to go straight ahead.
s5/s5_097|They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
s5/s5_237|But the town has great potential as a book town.
s5/s5_099|It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
s5/s5_265|It's about time something was done about equipment.
s5/s5_073|They had been in Scotland on exercise.
s5/s5_377|My wife and family are the support system.
s5/s5_336|Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
s5/s5_216|It would not have thought otherwise for one moment.
s5/s5_369|These old songs are very nice to play.
s5/s5_164|Nato has left them with no other option.
s5/s5_299|But the next day she paid for it.
s5/s5_203|I think every coach wants to work daily.
s5/s5_385|Lead feet were the order of the day.
s5/s5_104|I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
s5/s5_180|I've learned a huge amount from Michael.
s5/s5_042|I made my mind up before we came on tour.
s5/s5_347|Stewart ruled out a return of this cash to shareholders, however.
s5/s5_163|South Africa is the next likely customer.
s5/s5_105|It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
s5/s5_288|Do I think about them often?
s5/s5_066|The group is currently working to create several substantial new funds.
s5/s5_218|But not every story is a success story.
s5/s5_165|He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
s5/s5_246|We are delighted  nothing else, just delighted.
s5/s5_060|I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
s5/s5_362|My tax affairs have been totally open.
s5/s5_215|If not, a deal could take many months.
s5/s5_316|The future might well be green after all.
s5/s5_081|I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
s5/s5_120|There were no reports of any injuries.
s5/s5_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
s5/s5_292|I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
s5/s5_074|I can understand fully that Rangers and Celtic want to progress.
s5/s5_070|I do not attempt to answer that.
s5/s5_107|I felt my father was very hard.
s5/s5_247|We will be taking a world lead.
s5/s5_368|Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
s5/s5_033|He added that her comments were noted.
s5/s5_319|We can get back on track with that.
s5/s5_090|It is a great feeling right now.
s5/s5_176|You can see the damage that has been done.
s5/s5_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
s5/s5_030|The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
s5/s5_210|We are still seeking that complete performance.
s5/s5_315|Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
s5/s5_343|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
s5/s5_071|It's been a great evening for us.
s5/s5_392|However, there is an issue, isn't there?
s5/s5_089|Offers of company cars and other benefits have also become quite common.
s5/s5_334|Are they free?
s5/s5_366|Such a policy is for long-term strength.
s5/s5_138|But it looks good for next year.
s5/s5_238|He is not quite as confident as he appears.
s5/s5_332|How independent is that?
s5/s5_193|I expect to see a different Kilmarnock side tomorrow.
s5/s5_371|None of the fire has been lost.
s5/s5_221|This result has given me much food for thought.
s5/s5_266|He did not provide us with a proposal.
s5/s5_121|There is no future in rock music.
s5/s5_049|The full price was accepted by them.
s5/s5_064|Some of their players seemed almost dead.
s5/s5_320|White would like to buy further bus businesses.
s5/s5_278|It is based on population rather than need.
s5/s5_280|He could understand both points of view.
s5/s5_379|But the German product failed safety tests.
s5/s5_290|I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
s5/s5_141|Getting Kilmarnock so early in the Scottish season could give us a chance.
s5/s5_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
s5/s5_133|Are you from the rugby?
s5/s5_048|I can live here without a problem.
s5/s5_321|In short, he is the wrong candidate, but the right man.
s5/s5_035|I got in with a bad crowd.
s5/s5_179|Glasgow has continued to run it on an agency basis.
s5/s5_363|Five years ago its return was rejected.
s5/s5_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
s5/s5_335|Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
s5/s5_236|His home is provided by the government.
s5/s5_381|They wanted them to move fast, but some couldn't.
s5/s5_302|I would not want to be famous for nothing.
s5/s5_171|I was told that I've set that new club scoring record.
s5/s5_396|Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
s5/s5_108|Once again a strong services performance helped the overall trading position.
s5/s5_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was cp266/p266_252|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.p266/p266_289|It was good.p266/p266_255|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.p266/p266_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.p266/p266_109|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.p266/p266_413|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.p266/p266_132|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.p266/p266_368|He has been in a nursing home for two years.p266/p266_264|You take a risk.p266/p266_085|Someone who caresp266/p266_193|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.p266/p266_049|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.p266/p266_069|Then followed a bout of flu.p266/p266_248|There will be widespread support on all sides.p266/p266_216|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.p266/p266_041|It's the only thing.p266/p266_173|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.p266/p266_391|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.p266/p266_191|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.p266/p266_417|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.p266/p266_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.p266/p266_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.p266/p266_392|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.p266/p266_160|There's a pause.p266/p266_222|I will win.p266/p266_269|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.p266/p266_183|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.p266/p266_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.p266/p266_155|I might come back.p266/p266_201|It's all about money, money, money.p266/p266_158|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.p266/p266_117|It was the eighties.p266/p266_424|I chose to make a film.p266/p266_371|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.p266/p266_262|It will be done in stages.p266/p266_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.p266/p266_209|I was so nervous.p266/p266_181|I've been there.p266/p266_339|This is a big advantage.p266/p266_074|The party is up for it.p266/p266_125|I'm so angry.p266/p266_171|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.p266/p266_048|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.p266/p266_124|There were no grounds for his action.p266/p266_115|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.p266/p266_288|She is an expert on medical ethics.p266/p266_334|Who will do it?p266/p266_036|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.p266/p266_373|So there, we won.p266/p266_409|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.p266/p266_293|It could well be military.p266/p266_199|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.p266/p266_066|He was at home with his pals.p266/p266_157|My Dad is a hero.p266/p266_194|Is that success?p266/p266_318|You may have a short memory.p266/p266_326|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.p266/p266_165|I haven't had a lesson in four years.p266/p266_027|Is this accurate?p266/p266_226|They tried to give her advice.p266/p266_082|He is driven.p266/p266_094|I love the Dome.p266/p266_410|He got his degree.p266/p266_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.p266/p266_361|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.p266/p266_399|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.p266/p266_162|I've put my own money into this project.p266/p266_128|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.p266/p266_275|It was very fast.p266/p266_418|That may be.p266/p266_256|Chelsea was a great club.p266/p266_342|went on sale.p266/p266_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.p266/p266_336|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.p266/p266_121|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.p266/p266_375|By that time, however, it was already too late.p266/p266_345|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.p266/p266_246|It was a hit.p266/p266_287|Tony Blair said as little.p266/p266_271|We're in shock.p266/p266_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.p266/p266_062|Try to save us.p266/p266_244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.p266/p266_316|Your father was a good man.p266/p266_214|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.p266/p266_073|It works for us.p266/p266_285|Dialogue is the key.p266/p266_247|There's the mix.p266/p266_355|You must have a government and a good civil service.p266/p266_335|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.p266/p266_100|May not have been at fault?p266/p266_055|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.p266/p266_179|I'm just going to hit the shot.p266/p266_405|I knew the script.p266/p266_263|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.p266/p266_227|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.p266/p266_344|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.p266/p266_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.p266/p266_080|I first met him last summer.p266/p266_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.p266/p266_068|I was as strong as a horse.p266/p266_103|That would be unlawful.p266/p266_219|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.p266/p266_067|It's all I can do.p266/p266_083|He seems to be pleased with the picture.p266/p266_370|Twaddle is a case in point.p266/p266_309|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.p266/p266_324|It's too horrible to think.p266/p266_143|He realises his mistake.p266/p266_359|We will be homeless.p266/p266_250|We are in a war.p266/p266_379|I am a wealthy person.p266/p266_235|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.p266/p266_203|He knows a lot.p266/p266_311|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.p266/p266_241|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.p266/p266_026|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.p266/p266_138|I was dead.p266/p266_384|It's like a car crash.p266/p266_078|I will miss him.p266/p266_313|The minister is the engineer.p266/p266_153|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.p266/p266_034|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.p266/p266_145|I was awful.p266/p266_272|Our objective is to tackle poverty.p266/p266_040|Dancing was her life.p266/p266_202|It's a question of creating a future awareness.p266/p266_280|It's so awful.p266/p266_112|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.p266/p266_421|Such as it is.p266/p266_118|I did not see any reason to change the captain.p266/p266_352|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.p266/p266_060|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.p266/p266_065|Painful, but only because it's true.p266/p266_380|Colour was at the core of his life.p266/p266_159|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.p266/p266_276|She failed in her action.p266/p266_186|What has caused the demise of singing?p266/p266_197|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.p266/p266_075|Even the one she loved.p266/p266_051|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.p266/p266_320|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.p266/p266_387|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.p266/p266_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.p266/p266_111|It was a funny game.5_307|I thought the race was a little bit slow.
s5/s5_206|A European final must be the millennium target.
s5/s5_114|The balance comes from the five enterprise bodies involved.
s5/s5_298|Consumers have generally accepted this process to date.
s5/s5_132|So what is the campaign about?
s5/s5_375|They would have to go to the Royal.
s5/s5_270|He was right into football from an early age.
s5/s5_039|I wish I could see it again.
s5/s5_222|It is vital that the government gets this right.
p260/p260_279|You feel very helpless.
p260/p260_218|It's not before time.
p260/p260_313|We want to play at the worlds.
p260/p260_050|Her body was found about four miles from the car.
p260/p260_051|I was inspired by two things.
p260/p260_042|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p260/p260_001|Please call Stella.
p260/p260_066|And if he hadn't become a musician?
p260/p260_346|This is a big advantage.
p260/p260_199|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
p260/p260_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p260/p260_080|Who will pay for this?
p260/p260_324|I would love it.
p260/p260_071|He was at home with his pals.
p260/p260_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p260/p260_197|It was worth a photograph.
p260/p260_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p260/p260_285|The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
p260/p260_127|The people will come.
p260/p260_343|He has to learn.
p260/p260_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p260/p260_136|It seems so long since I did the exams.
p260/p260_321|We have got to get the points from this one.
p260/p260_273|His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
p260/p260_295|Who can predict?
p260/p260_151|I was on a roll.
p260/p260_137|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p260/p260_079|Today she has been released.
p260/p260_049|Here's a clue.
p260/p260_170|As we worked.
p260/p260_095|I love the Dome.
p260/p260_219|I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
p260/p260_227|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
p260/p260_091|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p260/p260_278|There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
p260/p260_052|For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
p260/p260_299|I was the sheep.
p260/p260_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p260/p260_120|That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
p260/p260_155|He was asked to quit.
p260/p260_087|Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
p260/p260_201|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
p260/p260_300|What has altered?
p260/p260_236|I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
p260/p260_301|Nothing is safe.
p260/p260_350|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p260/p260_306|I can live with it.
p260/p260_160|It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
p260/p260_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p260/p260_044|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p260/p260_322|The election is total confusion and chaos.
p260/p260_276|We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
p260/p260_316|Special measures were needed.
p260/p260_139|I was awful.
p260/p260_055|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p260/p260_237|You can feel at home in China.
p260/p260_332|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p260/p260_054|Sadly, it can't.
p260/p260_114|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p260/p260_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p260/p260_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p260/p260_046|It is marvellous.
p260/p260_172|It is not either national standards or local control.
p260/p260_268|It's a way of life.
p260/p260_164|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p260/p260_167|Does that put pressure on us?
p260/p260_126|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p260/p260_282|He will address the nation this evening.
p260/p260_135|I don't know the full story.
p260/p260_230|On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
p260/p260_078|People must remain vigilant.
p260/p260_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p260/p260_320|Such actions are rarely popular.
p260/p260_356|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p260/p260_185|It is a farce.
p260/p260_212|Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
p260/p260_205|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p260/p260_339|You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
p260/p260_269|She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
p260/p260_297|I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
p260/p260_214|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
p260/p260_090|This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
p260/p260_271|They seem to get away with it.
p260/p260_239|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p260/p260_043|We will push.
p260/p260_217|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p260/p260_204|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p260/p260_073|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p260/p260_232|The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
p260/p260_154|My Dad is a hero.
p260/p260_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p260/p260_298|Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
p260/p260_176|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p260/p260_132|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p260/p260_349|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p260/p260_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p260/p260_058|There's a danger.
p260/p260_086|Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
p260/p260_319|Your father was a good man.
p260/p260_251|Chelsea was a great club.
p260/p260_352|They should take their mobile phones.
p260/p260_191|They are ready.
p260/p260_243|I should think so, too.
p260/p260_084|They lived for their children.
p260/p260_145|So I got a blood test.
p260/p260_143|It is not just about pay.
p260/p260_144|Note the date.
p260/p260_112|I was fighting for my life, I thought.
p260/p260_291|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p260/p260_253|We have to expand.
p260/p260_259|This court has made an order which has not been observed.
p260/p260_103|Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
p260/p260_092|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p260/p260_116|We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
p260/p260_085|The city council is a major property owner in the area.
p260/p260_141|That group reported just before Christmas.
p260/p260_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p260/p260_287|Bombing slaughter rejected
p260/p260_188|I came home by ambulance.
p260/p260_222|Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
p260/p260_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p260/p260_123|There were no grounds for his action.
p260/p260_348|A great deal has been achieved.
p260/p260_027|Is this accurate?
p260/p260_315|and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
p260/p260_312|The letters are going out today.
p260/p260_128|No production was achieved.
p260/p260_305|They are wrong.
p260/p260_311|The minister is the engineer.
p260/p260_337|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p260/p260_100|May not have been at fault?
p260/p260_221|But she was.
p260/p260_274|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p260/p260_210|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p260/p260_152|She had gone to the Catholic school.
p260/p260_200|There was an e-mail.
p260/p260_229|There is no excuse.
p260/p260_153|We are on a four-year mission.
p260/p260_244|It was a hit.
p260/p260_142|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p260/p260_256|They must play for each other.
p260/p260_266|We're in shock.
p260/p260_096|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p260/p260_060|Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
p260/p260_329|We are in the end game.
p260/p260_270|However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
p260/p260_183|Our team is just so young.
p260/p260_333|It is a job creation scheme.
p260/p260_280|This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
p260/p260_158|Was this element always there?
p260/p260_303|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p260/p260_129|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p260/p260_245|There's the mix.
p260/p260_304|A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
p260/p260_026|We will be homeless.
p260/p260_309|The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
p260/p260_113|It was the eighties.
p260/p260_203|It had all been arranged.
p260/p260_224|The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
p260/p260_340|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p260/p260_056|I expect a rapid response.
p260/p260_281|What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p260/p260_246|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p260/p260_076|The party is up for it.
p260/p260_104|That's all right then.
p260/p260_334|Relief was beyond belief.
p260/p260_059|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p260/p260_286|This is a national crisis.
p260/p260_102|They make a selective perception process.
p260/p260_187|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p260/p260_206|It's not ideal.
p260/p260_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p260/p260_233|The car was just there.
p260/p260_255|Is that a serious question?
p260/p260_292|The songs are just so good.
p260/p260_072|It was magic.
p260/p260_077|Even the one she loved.
p260/p260_033|This is the window.
p260/p260_192|I have a cold.
p260/p260_267|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p260/p260_157|He can do no wrong.
p260/p260_225|We were awful.
p260/p260_111|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p260/p260_193|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p260/p260_275|If not, he should go home.
p260/p260_290|Painful, but only because it's true.
p260/p260_182|He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
p260/p260_025|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p260/p260_208|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
p260/p260_105|Oil embargo endorsed.
p260/p260_252|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p260/p260_194|I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
p260/p260_330|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p260/p260_115|It is so sad.
p260/p260_149|Crucially, though, United were still alive.
p260/p260_323|Henman has been warned.
p260/p260_331|There was no time scale.
p260/p260_353|Eight months later, he was dead.
p260/p260_131|Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
p260/p260_097|I am extremely sad.
p260/p260_211|The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
p260/p260_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p260/p260_039|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p260/p260_163|Seven people were later detained by police.
p260/p260_238|The scene is about this?
p260/p260_234|The whole thing will be great.
p260/p260_181|What has caused the demise of singing?
p260/p260_195|It's all about money, money, money.
p260/p260_166|They will do their own thing.
p260/p260_177|I've been there.
p260/p260_109|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p260/p260_037|It's a fact.
p260/p260_344|Two people were interviewed.
p260/p260_147|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p260/p260_307|Work has started.
p260/p260_064|I've spent a lot of time on buses.
p260/p260_341|He was the architect.
p260/p260_260|I am just trying to do my job.
p260/p260_314|The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
p260/p260_031|I'd just like to play.
p260/p260_068|We should have known.
p260/p260_310|You should be.
p260/p260_122|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p260/p260_089|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
p260/p260_146|The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
p260/p260_150|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p260/p260_070|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p260/p260_029|They have no history.
p260/p260_335|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p260/p260_119|It is rubbish.
p260/p260_175|Everyone can be bought.
p260/p260_342|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p260/p260_063|They are real.
p260/p260_283|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p260/p260_040|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p260/p260_248|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p260/p260_161|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p260/p260_302|One was a lawyer.
p260/p260_296|If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
p260/p260_345|I've got no secret.
p260/p260_347|I'm very lucky.
p260/p260_094|It is annoying.
p260/p260_338|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p260/p260_065|Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
p260/p260_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p260/p260_107|She reflects a bit.
p260/p260_223|My wife and family are the support system.
p260/p260_258|There's not much money in cycling.
p260/p260_032|There's a story, too.
p260/p260_241|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p260/p260_173|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
p260/p260_261|This is a question of Islam.
p260/p260_124|I can't even get into the A team.
p260/p260_231|But it's a subtle process.
p260/p260_088|It is a lifeline.
p260/p260_106|Before the game we went for a pint.
p260/p260_069|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p260/p260_272|She looked so young.
p260/p260_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p260/p260_250|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p260/p260_130|It plans to return to this field.
p260/p260_083|By then, he was walking on water.
p260/p260_242|Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
p260/p260_047|Every aspect of our play was first class.
p260/p260_351|This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
p260/p260_168|One season, they might do well.
p260/p260_213|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p260/p260_209|I might come back.
p260/p260_062|It's that kind of place.
p260/p260_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p260/p260_117|It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
p260/p260_308|In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
p260/p260_178|Four policemen were wounded.
p260/p260_159|These days are long gone.
p260/p260_226|They tried to give her advice.
p260/p260_216|Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
p260/p260_264|Frankly, we should all have such problems.
p260/p260_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p260/p260_134|We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
p260/p260_196|There was no safety net.
p260/p260_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p260/p260_262|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p260/p260_028|I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
p260/p260_093|Then came the crunch.
p260/p260_133|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p260/p260_277|We are a grandmother.
p260/p260_041|Dancing was her life.
p260/p260_328|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p260/p260_179|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p260/p260_207|In each case they were a goal down.
p260/p260_140|The idea is simple.
p260/p260_336|Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
p260/p260_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p260/p260_048|Our people are ready.
p260/p260_125|She really suffered for her art.
p260/p260_156|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p260/p260_215|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p260/p260_057|What was the main difference?
p260/p260_289|No Briton has ever won.
p260/p260_180|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p260/p260_190|Is that success?
p260/p260_354|I HAVE a dream.
p260/p260_081|He had taken everything from me.
p260/p260_235|Our policy is clear.
p260/p260_036|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p260/p260_184|I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
p260/p260_288|We are not going to forget.
p260/p260_249|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p260/p260_220|The report is due out next month.
p260/p260_138|It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
p260/p260_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p260/p260_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p260/p260_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p260/p260_101|They tried to deny it.
p260/p260_318|The show is at an end.
p260/p260_148|The weather forecast isn't good.
p260/p260_082|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p260/p260_099|However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
p260/p260_257|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p260/p260_074|The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
p260/p260_035|We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
p260/p260_202|I am delighted for Simon.
p260/p260_165|Again, we were lucky.
p260/p260_110|It was a funny game.
p260/p260_171|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p260/p260_186|Peace was won.
p260/p260_198|It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
p260/p260_162|They are not advertised.
p260/p260_228|The parties have been given until today to respond.
p260/p260_045|Among them are many criminals.
p260/p260_357|I first met him last summer.
p260/p260_038|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p260/p260_030|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p260/p260_061|George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
p260/p260_067|That was a gold medal for certain.
p260/p260_075|Is there a new way forward?
p260/p260_121|We enjoyed it today.
p260/p260_053|My fitness was very poor.
p260/p260_254|It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
p260/p260_293|And it's a goodbye from him.
p260/p260_098|It is a love affair.
p260/p260_284|Maloney is an engaging talent.
p260/p260_174|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p260/p260_294|The goals will come.
p260/p260_355|We have big ideas.
p260/p260_169|Is Saddam a threat?
p260/p260_327|For the moment, our position remains the same.
p260/p260_034|Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
p260/p260_265|The system can work.
p260/p260_247|Is there on his hands?
p260/p260_189|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p260/p260_118|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p260/p260_317|The Premier League has been a huge success.
p260/p260_326|The problems began a long time ago.
p260/p260_240|It was a kind of contempt.
p260/p260_263|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p266/p266_113|Is that right?
p266/p266_267|He was also married with two children.
p266/p266_024|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p266/p266_393|Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
p266/p266_296|Spent three months alone at sea.
p266/p266_385|Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
p266/p266_149|Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
p266/p266_116|It's a shame.
p266/p266_351|Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
p266/p266_274|That goes back a long way.
p266/p266_061|We recorded it at our own expense.
p266/p266_096|I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
p266/p266_369|It's now down in black and white.
p266/p266_340|Maloney was asked.
p266/p266_077|The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
p266/p266_015|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p266/p266_237|It is hard won.
p266/p266_012|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p266/p266_095|We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
p266/p266_120|Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
p266/p266_172|She said she would not welcome the flowers.
p266/p266_415|He was really great.
p266/p266_099|Journalists should make him.
p266/p266_308|This is a war over our home.
p266/p266_170|By then, however, both men were already in the US.
p266/p266_388|Does that put pressure on us?
p266/p266_300|Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
p266/p266_090|Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
p266/p266_043|The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
p266/p266_010|People look, but no one ever finds it.
p266/p266_137|He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
p266/p266_398|What happened in the summer?
p266/p266_119|In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
p266/p266_019|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p266/p266_190|But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
p266/p266_381|He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
p266/p266_357|You have to rely on each other.
p266/p266_126|It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
p266/p266_374|But I managed.
p266/p266_302|In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
p266/p266_245|I should think so, too.
p266/p266_367|We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
p266/p266_301|I was brought up in a mining background.
p266/p266_325|The airport was even different.
p266/p266_071|Neither it is.
p266/p266_239|You can feel at home in China.
p266/p266_156|We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
p266/p266_382|Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
p266/p266_200|It's just awful.
p266/p266_205|It had all been arranged.
p266/p266_198|Who will pay for this?
p266/p266_110|While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
p266/p266_007|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p266/p266_141|Who would be right?
p266/p266_321|In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
p266/p266_092|That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
p266/p266_310|The plot is minimal.
p266/p266_089|It is a lifeline.
p266/p266_341|But I was knocked out by the city.
p266/p266_228|They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
p266/p266_251|For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
p266/p266_231|It's quite nice.
p266/p266_243|My son was too young to die.
p266/p266_059|We should have known.
p266/p266_063|Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p266/p266_349|There may be reasons for it.
p266/p266_299|We lost a boy.
p266/p266_215|During the communist time they were very privileged.
p266/p266_057|Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
p266/p266_098|Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
p266/p266_329|Is there a new way forward?
p266/p266_356|Yet he left a few days later.
p266/p266_150|So I got a blood test.
p266/p266_033|Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
p266/p266_298|There was a vacuum.
p266/p266_291|Bombing slaughter rejected
p266/p266_346|It is long gone.
p266/p266_006|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p266/p266_395|He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
p266/p266_281|It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
p266/p266_136|Is that it?
p266/p266_283|Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
p266/p266_378|I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
p266/p266_419|It is legally binding.
p266/p266_016|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p266/p266_131|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
p266/p266_404|It's an absolute nonsense.
p266/p266_211|Work has started.
p266/p266_146|That group reported just before Christmas.
p266/p266_282|Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
p266/p266_032|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
p266/p266_221|Clearly, the stakes are high.
p266/p266_286|They have shown a great desire and attitude.
p266/p266_047|The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
p266/p266_192|I came home by ambulance.
p266/p266_218|Because they didn't want to know.
p266/p266_091|It's good news.
p266/p266_001|Please call Stella.
p266/p266_322|A review is under way.
p266/p266_129|We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
p266/p266_295|Robin Williams is very subdued.
p266/p266_127|I was on a roll.
p266/p266_234|It's a killer piece.
p266/p266_052|He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
p266/p266_406|They were kept there for a summer.
p266/p266_366|He could make it.
p266/p266_225|We were awful.
p266/p266_254|It was like the old days.
p266/p266_224|The report is due out next month.
p266/p266_328|But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
p266/p266_422|It looked like a war zone.
p266/p266_347|The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
p266/p266_139|I don't know the full story.
p266/p266_257|It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
p266/p266_217|Saturday is gone.
p266/p266_050|There was a substantial explosion.
p266/p266_238|It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
p266/p266_046|Is a drug dealer?
p266/p266_348|Tell us about it.
p266/p266_363|This is a club on the rise.
p266/p266_175|One season, they might do well.
p266/p266_003|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
p266/p266_180|Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
p266/p266_053|I expect a rapid response.
p266/p266_093|Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
p266/p266_273|Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
p266/p266_333|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
p266/p266_182|And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
p266/p266_261|Note the date.
p266/p266_037|Indeed, he does.
p266/p266_332|However, they will only be found in the wild.
p266/p266_167|We try to keep it right.
p266/p266_330|On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
p266/p266_042|It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
p266/p266_343|I'm very lucky.
p266/p266_253|That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
p266/p266_164|We need a new kind of theatre.
p266/p266_389|On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
p266/p266_054|What was the main difference?
p266/p266_081|He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
p266/p266_177|As we worked.
p266/p266_056|They're appalled by that.
p266/p266_307|But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
p266/p266_394|They are good.
p266/p266_327|There was no time scale.
p266/p266_008|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p266/p266_268|The system can work.
p266/p266_386|Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
p266/p266_038|People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
p266/p266_278|They seem to get away with it.
p266/p266_151|But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
p266/p266_284|Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
p266/p266_402|He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
p266/p266_319|The problems began a long time ago.
p266/p266_292|It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
p266/p266_362|Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
p266/p266_220|If it doesn't, it doesn't.
p266/p266_174|They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
p266/p266_133|Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
p266/p266_196|Tommy is not a problem.
p266/p266_306|I can give no comment.
p266/p266_168|Seven people were later detained by police.
p266/p266_412|In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
p266/p266_169|It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
p266/p266_270|It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
p266/p266_397|So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
p266/p266_407|The weekly average was three hours.
p266/p266_372|It is a simple equation.
p266/p266_105|He takes the job.
p266/p266_104|Oil embargo endorsed.
p266/p266_088|It will be tight.
p266/p266_265|He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
p266/p266_039|Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
p266/p266_204|We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
p266/p266_258|We have to expand.
p266/p266_376|There is no signature.
p266/p266_079|He is in the queue.
p266/p266_154|They have not been named.
p266/p266_058|There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
p266/p266_044|A neighbour said.
p266/p266_305|The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
p266/p266_423|I've invented a village in East Lothian.
p266/p266_123|We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
p266/p266_207|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
p266/p266_045|Among them are many criminals.
p266/p266_176|Is Saddam a threat?
p266/p266_013|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p266/p266_416|Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
p266/p266_147|He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
p266/p266_303|Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
p266/p266_106|She reflects a bit.
p266/p266_229|Half of young people had had contact with the police.
p266/p266_035|It was clear.
p266/p266_021|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
p266/p266_377|The task is enormous.
p266/p266_403|So I did.
p266/p266_011|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p266/p266_350|I believe the gap is nearly there.
p266/p266_277|He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
p266/p266_178|However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
p266/p266_304|The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
p266/p266_212|The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
p266/p266_232|It would still have been a good film, but very different.
p266/p266_297|He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
p266/p266_135|It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
p266/p266_354|Both of those promises have already been honoured.
p266/p266_002|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
p266/p266_323|We are in the end game.
p266/p266_266|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
p266/p266_396|It was a breathtaking moment.
p266/p266_223|It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
p266/p266_290|Who did the recruiting?
p266/p266_097|I saw the whole thing.
p266/p266_187|Our team is just so young.
p266/p266_076|Today she has been released.
p266/p266_208|We want to keep the pound.
p266/p266_390|It is unusual.
p266/p266_022|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p266/p266_411|The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
p266/p266_242|We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
p266/p266_070|Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
p266/p266_315|We have got no money to go anywhere.
p266/p266_122|Who would have?
p266/p266_148|It is not just about pay.
p266/p266_014|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p266/p266_233|Of further privacy, he had no need.
p266/p266_236|In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
p266/p266_414|But we finished the show.
p266/p266_152|The weather forecast isn't good.
p266/p266_365|He was also a great man.
p266/p266_030|They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
p266/p266_140|And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
p266/p266_018|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p266/p266_144|He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
p266/p266_086|It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
p266/p266_114|It is a total and utter change of culture.
p266/p266_108|Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
p266/p266_331|Finally, he paid for the movie.
p266/p266_102|Here, again, they were denied a voice.
p266/p266_364|Not so, it seems.
p266/p266_210|He seemed to lose his focus.
p266/p266_195|The service from the other players was super.
p266/p266_163|Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
p266/p266_064|Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
p266/p266_312|You should be.
p266/p266_166|Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
p266/p266_184|I saw military vehicles in the distance.
p266/p266_025|She looked so young.
p266/p266_230|There is no excuse.
p266/p266_161|Was this element always there?
p266/p266_420|Paris is not only young.
p266/p266_279|He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
p266/p266_206|It's not before time.
p266/p266_031|Then, suddenly, they weren't.
p266/p266_017|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p266/p266_360|Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
p266/p266_338|We've tried every other way.
p266/p266_087|They lived for their children.
p266/p266_408|Relief was beyond belief.
p266/p266_294|No Briton has ever won.
p266/p266_189|Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
p266/p266_130|We work well together.
p266/p266_029|There's a story, too.
p266/p266_107|Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
p266/p266_249|He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
p266/p266_401|Emotions were complex.
p266/p266_353|She is free.
p266/p266_260|Souter will be back.
p266/p266_072|It is a job creation scheme.
p266/p266_317|We are a peaceful people.
p266/p266_358|It was one in the afternoon.
p266/p266_142|She died at her home.
p266/p266_240|The scene is about this?
p266/p266_314|I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
p266/p266_337|Two people were interviewed.
p266/p266_188|O Neill has delivered.
p266/p266_134|On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
p266/p266_252|It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
p266/p266_289|It was good.
p266/p266_255|However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
p266/p266_028|Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
p266/p266_109|It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
p266/p266_413|Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
p266/p266_132|Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
p266/p266_368|He has been in a nursing home for two years.
p266/p266_264|You take a risk.
p266/p266_085|Someone who cares
p266/p266_193|The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
p266/p266_049|No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
p266/p266_069|Then followed a bout of flu.
p266/p266_248|There will be widespread support on all sides.
p266/p266_216|This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
p266/p266_041|It's the only thing.
p266/p266_173|It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
p266/p266_391|In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
p266/p266_191|It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
p266/p266_417|The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
p266/p266_004|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p266/p266_400|But, in fact, the reverse is true.
p266/p266_392|A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
p266/p266_160|There's a pause.
p266/p266_222|I will win.
p266/p266_269|We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
p266/p266_183|It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
p266/p266_213|On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
p266/p266_155|I might come back.
p266/p266_201|It's all about money, money, money.
p266/p266_158|For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
p266/p266_117|It was the eighties.
p266/p266_424|I chose to make a film.
p266/p266_371|Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
p266/p266_262|It will be done in stages.
p266/p266_101|Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
p266/p266_209|I was so nervous.
p266/p266_181|I've been there.
p266/p266_339|This is a big advantage.
p266/p266_074|The party is up for it.
p266/p266_125|I'm so angry.
p266/p266_171|Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
p266/p266_048|In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
p266/p266_124|There were no grounds for his action.
p266/p266_115|He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
p266/p266_288|She is an expert on medical ethics.
p266/p266_334|Who will do it?
p266/p266_036|A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
p266/p266_373|So there, we won.
p266/p266_409|Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
p266/p266_293|It could well be military.
p266/p266_199|The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
p266/p266_066|He was at home with his pals.
p266/p266_157|My Dad is a hero.
p266/p266_194|Is that success?
p266/p266_318|You may have a short memory.
p266/p266_326|They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
p266/p266_165|I haven't had a lesson in four years.
p266/p266_027|Is this accurate?
p266/p266_226|They tried to give her advice.
p266/p266_082|He is driven.
p266/p266_094|I love the Dome.
p266/p266_410|He got his degree.
p266/p266_020|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p266/p266_361|It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
p266/p266_399|Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
p266/p266_162|I've put my own money into this project.
p266/p266_128|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
p266/p266_275|It was very fast.
p266/p266_418|That may be.
p266/p266_256|Chelsea was a great club.
p266/p266_342|went on sale.
p266/p266_009|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p266/p266_336|Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
p266/p266_121|There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
p266/p266_375|By that time, however, it was already too late.
p266/p266_345|A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
p266/p266_246|It was a hit.
p266/p266_287|Tony Blair said as little.
p266/p266_271|We're in shock.
p266/p266_084|Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
p266/p266_062|Try to save us.
p266/p266_244|In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
p266/p266_316|Your father was a good man.
p266/p266_214|But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
p266/p266_073|It works for us.
p266/p266_285|Dialogue is the key.
p266/p266_247|There's the mix.
p266/p266_355|You must have a government and a good civil service.
p266/p266_335|Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
p266/p266_100|May not have been at fault?
p266/p266_055|We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
p266/p266_179|I'm just going to hit the shot.
p266/p266_405|I knew the script.
p266/p266_263|That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
p266/p266_227|They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
p266/p266_344|Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
p266/p266_005|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
p266/p266_080|I first met him last summer.
p266/p266_023|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p266/p266_068|I was as strong as a horse.
p266/p266_103|That would be unlawful.
p266/p266_219|The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
p266/p266_067|It's all I can do.
p266/p266_083|He seems to be pleased with the picture.
p266/p266_370|Twaddle is a case in point.
p266/p266_309|Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
p266/p266_324|It's too horrible to think.
p266/p266_143|He realises his mistake.
p266/p266_359|We will be homeless.
p266/p266_250|We are in a war.
p266/p266_379|I am a wealthy person.
p266/p266_235|I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
p266/p266_203|He knows a lot.
p266/p266_311|They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
p266/p266_241|The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
p266/p266_026|Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
p266/p266_138|I was dead.
p266/p266_384|It's like a car crash.
p266/p266_078|I will miss him.
p266/p266_313|The minister is the engineer.
p266/p266_153|The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
p266/p266_034|However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
p266/p266_145|I was awful.
p266/p266_272|Our objective is to tackle poverty.
p266/p266_040|Dancing was her life.
p266/p266_202|It's a question of creating a future awareness.
p266/p266_280|It's so awful.
p266/p266_112|According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
p266/p266_421|Such as it is.
p266/p266_118|I did not see any reason to change the captain.
p266/p266_352|Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
p266/p266_060|Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
p266/p266_065|Painful, but only because it's true.
p266/p266_380|Colour was at the core of his life.
p266/p266_159|This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
p266/p266_276|She failed in her action.
p266/p266_186|What has caused the demise of singing?
p266/p266_197|The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
p266/p266_075|Even the one she loved.
p266/p266_051|Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
p266/p266_320|Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
p266/p266_387|Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
p266/p266_259|However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
p266/p266_111|It was a funny game.
